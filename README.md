# ***Homemade* BERT-based Search Engine**
#### Anh-Dung LE & Paul MELKI [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/ )

This project aims at implementing a BERT-based working search engine. 
The project is inspired by the recent work by **R. Noguiera and K. Cho, [*Passage Re-ranking with BERT*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.04085.pdf)**, which shows that language models are particularly useful for information retrieval, the main task implemented by a search engine. The project also aims at comparing different models and different architecture (*END-TO-END* vs. *BM25 + BERT*).
