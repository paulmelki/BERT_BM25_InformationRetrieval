apoptosis begins when the nucleus of the cell begins to shrink after the shrinking the plasma membrane blebs and folds around different organelles the blebs continue to form and the organelles fragment and move away from one another apoptosis from ancient greek ἀπόπτωσις apóptōsis falling off is form of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes morphology and death these changes include blebbing cell shrinkage nuclear fragmentation chromatin condensation chromosomal dna fragmentation and global mrna decay the average adult human loses between and billion cells each day due to apoptosis for an average human child between the ages of and approximately billion cells die per day in contrast to necrosis which is form of traumatic cell death that results from acute cellular injury apoptosis is highly regulated and controlled process that confers advantages during an organism life cycle for example the separation of fingers and toes in developing human embryo occurs because cells between the digits undergo apoptosis unlike necrosis apoptosis produces cell fragments called apoptotic bodies that phagocytic cells are able to engulf and remove before the contents of the cell can spill out onto surrounding cells and cause damage to them because apoptosis cannot stop once it has begun it is highly regulated process apoptosis can be initiated through one of two pathways in the intrinsic pathway the cell kills itself because it senses cell stress while in the extrinsic pathway the cell kills itself because of signals from other cells weak external signals may also activate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis both pathways induce cell death by activating caspases which are proteases or enzymes that degrade proteins the two pathways both activate initiator caspases which then activate executioner caspases which then kill the cell by degrading proteins in addition to its importance as biological phenomenon defective apoptotic processes have been implicated in wide variety of diseases excessive apoptosis causes atrophy whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation such as cancer some factors like fas receptors and caspases promote apoptosis while some members of the bcl family of proteins inhibit apoptosis discovery and etymology german scientist carl vogt was first to describe the principle of apoptosis in in anatomist walther flemming delivered more precise description of the process of programmed cell death however it was not until that the topic was resurrected while studying tissues using electron microscopy john foxton ross kerr at the university of queensland was able to distinguish apoptosis from traumatic cell death following the publication of paper describing the phenomenon kerr was invited to join alastair currie as well as andrew wyllie who was currie graduate student at university of aberdeen in the trio published seminal article in the british journal of cancer kerr had initially used the term programmed cell necrosis but in the article the process of natural cell death was called apoptosis kerr wyllie and currie credited james cormack professor of greek language at university of aberdeen with suggesting the term apoptosis kerr received the paul ehrlich and ludwig darmstaedter prize on march for his description of apoptosis he shared the prize with boston biologist robert horvitz for many years neither apoptosis nor programmed cell death was highly cited term two discoveries brought cell death from obscurity to major field of research identification of components of the cell death control and effector mechanisms and linkage of abnormalities in cell death to human disease in particular cancer the nobel prize in medicine was awarded to sydney brenner horvitz and john sulston for their work identifying genes that control apoptosis the genes were identified by studies in the nematode elegans and homologues of these genes function in humans to regulate apoptosis john sulston won the nobel prize in medicine in for his pioneering research on apoptosis in greek apoptosis translates to the falling off of leaves from tree cormack professor of greek language reintroduced the term for medical use as it had medical meaning for the greeks over two thousand years before hippocrates used the term to mean the falling off of the bones galen extended its meaning to the dropping of the scabs cormack was no doubt aware of this usage when he suggested the name debate continues over the correct pronunciation with opinion divided between pronunciation with the second silent and the second pronounced as in the original greek in english the of the greek pt consonant cluster is typically silent at the beginning of word pterodactyl ptolemy but articulated when used in combining forms preceded by vowel as in helicopter or the orders of insects diptera lepidoptera etc in the original kerr wyllie currie paper there is footnote regarding the pronunciation we are most grateful to professor james cormack of the department of greek university of aberdeen for suggesting this term the word apoptosis is used in greek to describe the dropping off or falling off of petals from flowers or leaves from trees to show the derivation clearly we propose that the stress should be on the penultimate syllable the second half of the word being pronounced like ptosis with the silent which comes from the same root to fall and is already used to describe the drooping of the upper eyelid activation mechanisms right control of the apoptotic mechanisms the initiation of apoptosis is tightly regulated by activation mechanisms because once apoptosis has begun it inevitably leads to the death of the cell the two best understood activation mechanisms are the intrinsic pathway also called the mitochondrial pathway and the extrinsic pathway the intrinsic pathway is activated by intracellular signals generated when cells are stressed and depends on the release of proteins from the intermembrane space of mitochondria the extrinsic pathway is activated by extracellular ligands binding to cell surface death receptors which leads to the formation of the death inducing signaling complex disc cell initiates intracellular apoptotic signaling in response to stress which may bring about cell suicide the binding of nuclear receptors by glucocorticoids heat radiation
