poverty and hunger was the first millennium development goal mdg as set by the united nations in specifically the target was to reduce the extreme poverty rate by half by goal that was met five years

rights the lack of basic security connotes the absence of one or more factors enabling individuals and families to assume basic and to enjoy fundamental rights the situation may become widespread and result in more serious and permanent consequences the lack of basic security leads to chronic poverty when it simultaneously affects several aspects of people lives when it is prolonged and when it severely compromises people chances of regaining their rights and of reassuming their in the foreseeable future this definition was mentioned previously in june in the preliminary report on the realization of economic social and cultural rights by the un special rapporteur danilo t√ºrk it is still in use today among others in the current un guiding principles on extreme poverty and human

account for inflation and differences in the cost of living it was originally defined at day in the updates are made according to new price data to portray the costs of basic food health services clothing and shelter around the world as accurately as possible the latest revision was made in when the world bank increased the line to international because many of the world poorest people do not have monetary income the poverty measurement is based on the monetary value of person consumption otherwise the poverty measurement would be missing the home production of subsistence farmer that consume largely their own production alternative definitions share of population living in poverty in the day extreme poverty line remains the most widely used metric as it highlights the reality of those in the most severe conditions although widely used by most international organizations it has come under scrutiny due to variety of factors for example it does not account for how far below the line people are referred to as the depth of poverty for this purpose the same institutions publish data on the poverty gap the international poverty line is designed to stay constant over time to allow comparisons between different years it is therefore measure of absolute poverty and is not measuring relative poverty it is also not designed to capture how people view their own financial situation known as the socially subjective poverty line moreover the calculation of the poverty line relies on information about consumer prices to calculate purchasing power parity which are very hard to measure and are necessarily debatable as with all other metrics there may also be missing data from the poorest and most fragile countries several alternative instruments for measuring extreme poverty have been suggested which incorporate other factors such as malnutrition and lack of access to basic education the poverty index mpi based on the alkire foster method is published by the oxford poverty human development initiative ophi it measures deprivation in basic needs and can be broken down
