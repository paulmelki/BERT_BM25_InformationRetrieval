terracotta modello of cardinal paolo emilio zacchia alessandro algardi november june was an italian high baroque sculptor active almost exclusively in rome where for the latter decades of his life he was along with francesco borromini and pietro da cortona one of the major rivals of gian lorenzo bernini he is now most admired for his portrait busts that have great vivacity and dignity early years algardi was born in bologna where at young age he was apprenticed in the studio of agostino carracci however his aptitude for sculpture led him to work for giulio cesare conventi an artist of modest talents his two earliest known works date back to this period two statues of saints made of chalk in the oratory of santa maria della vita in bologna by the age of twenty ferdinando duke of mantua began commissioning works from him and he was also employed by local jewelers for figurative designs after short residence in venice he went to rome in with an introduction from the duke of mantua to the late pope nephew cardinal ludovico ludovisi who employed him for time in the restoration of ancient statues tomb of pope leo xi propelled by the borghese and barberini patronage gian lorenzo bernini and his studio garnered most of the major roman sculptural commissions for nearly decade algardi struggled for recognition in rome he was aided by friends that included pietro da cortona and his fellow bolognese domenichino his early roman commissions included terracotta and some marble portrait busts while he supported himself with small works like crucifixes in the he worked on the tombs of the mellini family in the mellini chapel in santa maria del popolo tomb of leo xi algardi first major commission came about in when cardinal ubaldini medici contracted for funeral monument for his great uncle pope leo xi the third of the medici popes who had reigned for less than month in the monument was started in and mostly completed by the arrangement mirrors the one designed by bernini for the tomb of urban viii with central hieratic sculpture of the pope seated in full regalia and offering hand of blessing while at his feet two allegorical female figures flank his sarcophagus however in bernini tomb the vigorous upraised arm and posture of the pope is counterbalanced by an active drama below wherein the figures of charity and justice are either distracted by putti or lost in contemplation while skeletal death actively writes the epitaph algardi tomb is much less dynamic the allegorical figures of magnanimity and liberality have an impassive ethereal dignity some have identified the helmeted figure of magnanimity with that of athena and iconic images of wisdom liberality resembles duquesnoy famous santa susanna but rendered more elegant the tomb is somberly monotone and lacks the polychromatic excitement that detracts from the elegiac mood of urban viii tomb in pietro boncompagni commissioned from algardi colossal statue of philip neri with kneeling angels for santa maria in vallicella completed in immediately after this algardi produced an interactive sculptural group representing the beheading of saint paul with two figures kneeling resigned saint and the executioner poised to strike the sword blow for the church of san paolo bologna these works established his reputation like bernini characteristic works they often express the baroque aesthetic of depicting dramatic attitudes and emotional expressions yet algardi sculpture has restraining sobriety in contrast to those of his rival papal favour under innocent and spanish commissions pope innocent capitoline museums with the death of the barberini pope urban viii in and the accession of the pamphilj pope innocent the barberini family and fell into disrepute resulting in fewer commissions for bernini algardi on the other hand was embraced by the new pope and the pope nephew camillo pamphilj algardi portraits were highly prized and their formal severity contrasts with bernini more vivacious expression large hieratic bronze of innocent by algardi is now to be found in the capitoline museums algardi was not renowned for his architectural abilities although he was in charge of the project for the papal villa the villa pamphili now villa doria pamphili outside the porta san pancrazio in rome he may have had professional guidance on the design of the casino from the architect engineer girolamo rainaldi and help with supervising its construction from his assistant giovanni francesco grimaldi the casino was showcase for the pamphili collection of sculpture ancient and contemporary on which algardi was well able to advise in the villa grounds algardi and his studio executed sculpture encrusted fountains and other garden features where some of his free standing sculpture and bas reliefs remain in algardi met diego vel√°zquez who obtained commissions for his work from spain as consequence there are four chimney pieces by algardi in the royal palace of aranjuez and in the gardens the figures on the fountain of neptune are also by him the augustinian monastery at salamanca contains the tomb of the count and countess de monterey another work by algardi fuga attila st peter basilica the fuga attila relief algardi large dramatic high relief marble panel of pope leo and attila created from is commonly referred to as fuga attila or flight of attila it was created for st peter basilica and it reinvigorated the use of such marble reliefs there had been large marble reliefs used previously in roman churches but for most patrons sculpted marble altarpieces were far too costly in this relief the two principal figures the stern and courageous pope and the dismayed and frightened attila surge forward from the center into three dimensions only they two see the descending angelic warriors rallying to the pope defense while all others in the background reliefs persist in performing their respective earthly duties the subject was apt for papal state seeking to increase its power since it depicts the historical legend wherein saint leo the great the first pope to receive the epithet with supernatural aid deterred the huns from looting
