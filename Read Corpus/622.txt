apollo was an october space mission carried out by the united states it was the first crewed flight in nasa apollo program and saw the resumption of human spaceflight by the agency after the fire that killed the three apollo astronauts in january the apollo crew was commanded by walter schirra with command module pilot donn eisele and lunar module pilot walter cunningham so designated even though apollo did not carry lunar module the three astronauts were originally designated for the second crewed apollo flight and then as backups for apollo after the fire crewed flights were suspended while the cause of the accident was investigated and improvements made to the spacecraft and safety procedures and uncrewed test flights made determined to prevent repetition of the fire the crew spent long periods of time monitoring the construction of their apollo command and service modules csm training continued over much of the month pause that followed the apollo disaster apollo was launched on october from cape kennedy air force station florida and splashed down in the atlantic ocean eleven days later extensive testing of the csm took place and also the first live television broadcast from an american spacecraft despite tension between the crew and ground controllers the mission was complete technical success giving nasa the confidence to send apollo into orbit around the moon two months later in part because of these tensions none of the crew flew in space again though schirra had already announced he would retire from nasa after the flight apollo fulfilled apollo mission of testing the csm in low earth orbit and was significant step forward towards nasa goal of landing astronauts on the moon background and personnel schirra one of the original mercury seven astronauts graduated from the united states naval academy in he flew mercury atlas in the fifth crewed flight of project mercury the third to reach orbit and was the command pilot for gemini he was year old captain in the navy at the time of apollo eisele graduated from the naval academy in with in aeronautics he elected to be commissioned in the air force and was year old major at the time of apollo cunningham joined the navy in began flight training the following year and served in marine flight squadron from to and was civilian aged serving in the marine corps reserves with rank of major at the time of apollo he received degrees in physics from ucla in and an in both eisele and cunningham were selected as part of the third group of astronauts in schirra crew trains for apollo eisele was originally slotted for position on gus grissom apollo crew along with ed white but days prior to the official announcement on march eisele sustained shoulder injury that would require surgery instead roger chaffee was given the position and eisele was reassigned to schirra crew schirra eisele and cunningham were first named as an apollo crew on september they were to fly second earth orbital test of the apollo command module cm although delighted as rookie to be assigned to prime crew without having served as backup cunningham was troubled by the fact that apollo seemed unnecessary if apollo was successful he learned later that director of flight crew operations deke slayton another of the mercury seven who had been grounded for medical reasons and supervised the astronauts planned with schirra support to command the mission if he gained medical clearance when this was not forthcoming schirra remained in command of the crew and in november apollo was cancelled and schirra crew assigned as backup to grissom on january grissom crew was conducting launch pad test for their planned february mission when fire broke out in the cabin killing all three men complete safety review of the apollo program followed soon after the fire slayton asked schirra eisele and cunningham to fly the first mission after the pause apollo would use the blockii spacecraft designed for the lunar missions as opposed to the block csm used for apollo which was intended only to be used for the early earth orbit missions as it lacked the capability of docking with lunar module the cm and astronauts spacesuits had been extensively redesigned to reduce any chance of repeat of the accident which killed the first crew schirra crew would test the life support propulsion guidance and control systems during this open ended mission meaning it would be extended as it passed each test the duration was limited to days reduced from the original day limit for apollo the backup crew consisted of thomas stafford as commander john young as command module pilot and eugene cernan as lunar module pilot they became the prime crew of apollo ronald evans john jack swigert and edward givens were assigned to the support crew for the mission givens died in car accident on june and william pogue was assigned as his replacement evans was involved in hardware testing at kennedy space center ksc swigert was the launch capsule communicator capcom and worked on the mission operational aspects pogue spent time modifying procedures the support crew also filled in when the primary and backup crews were unavailable capcoms the person in mission control responsible for communicating with the spacecraft then always an astronaut were evans pogue stafford swigert young and cernan flight directors were glynn lunney gene kranz and gerry griffin preparation according to cunningham schirra originally had limited interest in making third spaceflight beginning to focus on his post nasa career flying the first mission after the fire changed things wally schirra was being pictured as the man chosen to rescue the manned space program and that was task worthy of wally interest eisele noted coming on the heels of the fire we knew the fate and future of the entire manned space program not to mention our own skins was riding on the success or failure of apollo given the circumstances of the fire the crew initially had little confidence
