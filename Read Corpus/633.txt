pacific ocean he survived that ordeal but succumbed to tropical illness years later while serving aboard off west africa selkirk was an unruly youth and joined buccaneering voyages to the south pacific during the war of the spanish succession one such expedition was on cinque ports captained by thomas stradling under the overall command of william dampier stradling ship stopped to resupply at the uninhabited juan fernández islands and selkirk judged correctly that the craft was unseaworthy and asked to be left there by the time he was eventually rescued by english privateer woodes rogers in company with dampier selkirk had become adept at hunting and making use of the resources that he found on the island his story of survival was widely publicised after his return to england becoming source of inspiration for writer daniel defoe fictional character robinson crusoe early life and privateering alexander selkirk was the son of shoemaker and tanner in lower largo fife scotland born in in his youth he displayed quarrelsome and unruly disposition he was summoned before the kirk session in august for his indecent conduct in church but he did not appear being gone to sea he was back at largo in when he again came to the attention of church authorities for assaulting his brothers early on he was engaged in buccaneering in he joined an expedition of english privateer and explorer william dampier to the south pacific ocean setting sail from kinsale in ireland on september they carried letters of marque from the lord high admiral authorising their armed merchant ships to attack foreign enemies as the war of the spanish succession was then going on between england and spain dampier was captain of st george and selkirk served on cinque ports st george companion ship as sailing master under captain thomas stradling by this time selkirk must have had considerable experience at sea in february following stormy passage around cape horn the privateers fought long battle with well armed french vessel st joseph only to have it escape to warn its spanish allies of their arrival in the pacific raid on the panamanian gold mining town of santa maría failed when their landing party was ambushed the easy capture of asunción heavily laden merchantman revived the men hopes of plunder and selkirk was put in charge of the prize ship dampier took off some much needed provisions of wine brandy sugar and flour then abruptly set the ship free arguing that the gain was not worth the effort in may stradling decided to abandon dampier and strike out on his own castaway map of the juan fernández islands where selkirk lived as castaway in september after parting ways with dampier captain stradling brought cinque ports to an island known to the spanish as más tierra located in the uninhabited juan fernández archipelago off the coast of chile for mid expedition restocking of fresh water and supplies selkirk had grave concerns about the seaworthiness of their vessel and wanted to make the necessary repairs before going any farther he declared that he would rather stay on juan fernández than continue in dangerously leaky ship stradling took him up on the offer and landed selkirk on the island with musket hatchet knife cooking pot bible bedding and some clothes selkirk immediately regretted his rashness but stradling refused to let him back on board cinque ports did indeed later founder off the coast of what is now colombia stradling and some of his crew survived the loss of their ship but were forced to surrender to the spanish the survivors were taken to lima peru where they endured harsh imprisonment life on the island at first selkirk remained along the shoreline of juan fernández during this time he ate spiny lobsters and scanned the ocean daily for rescue suffering all the while from loneliness misery and remorse hordes of raucous sea lions gathered on the beach for the mating season eventually drove him to the island interior once inland his way of life took turn for the better more foods were available there feral goats introduced by earlier sailors provided him with meat and milk while wild turnips the leaves of the indigenous cabbage tree and dried schinus fruits pink peppercorns offered him variety and spice rats would attack him at night but he was able to sleep soundly and in safety by domesticating and living near feral cats selkirk reading his bible in one of two huts he built on mountainside selkirk proved resourceful in using materials that he found on the island he forged new knife out of barrel hoops left on the beach he built two huts out of pepper trees one of which he used for cooking and the other for sleeping and he employed his musket to hunt goats and his knife to clean their carcasses as his gunpowder dwindled he had to chase prey on foot during one such chase he was badly injured when he tumbled from cliff lying helpless and unable to move for about day his prey had cushioned his fall probably sparing him broken back childhood lessons learned from his father tanner now served him well for example when his clothes wore out he made new ones from hair covered goatskins using nail for sewing as his shoes became unusable he had no need to replace them since his toughened calloused feet made protection unnecessary he sang psalms and read from the bible finding it comfort in his situation and prop for his english during his sojourn on the island two vessels came to anchor unfortunately for selkirk both were spanish as scotsman and privateer he would have faced grim fate if captured and therefore did his best to hide himself once he was spotted and chased by group of
