conservation and restoration of cultural heritage focuses on protection and care of tangible cultural heritage including artworks architecture archaeology and museum collections conservation activities include preventive conservation examination documentation research treatment and education this field is closely allied with conservation science curators and registrars definition revision and conservation of the holy trinity column in olomouc czech republic in conservation of cultural heritage involves protection and restoration using any methods that prove effective in keeping that property in as close to its original condition as possible for as long as possible conservation of cultural heritage is often associated with art collections and museums and involves collection care and management through tracking examination documentation exhibition storage preventive conservation and restoration the scope has widened from art conservation involving protection and care of artwork and architecture to conservation of cultural heritage also including protection and care of broad set of other cultural and historical works conservation of cultural heritage can be described as type of ethical stewardship conservation of cultural heritage applies simple ethical guidelines minimal intervention appropriate materials and reversible methods full documentation of all work undertaken often there are compromises between preserving appearance maintaining original design and material properties and ability to reverse changes reversibility is now emphasized so as to reduce problems with future treatment investigation and use in order for conservators to decide upon an appropriate conservation strategy and apply their professional expertise accordingly they must take into account views of the stakeholder the values artist intent meaning of the work and the physical needs of the material cesare brandi in his theory of restoration describes restoration as the methodological moment in which the work of art is appreciated in its material form and in its historical and aesthetic duality with view to transmitting it to the future history key dates some consider the tradition of conservation of cultural heritage in europe to have begun in with the restoration of the sistine chapel frescoes but more ancient examples include the work of cassiodorus brief history an early video showing some activities in conservation laboratory at the rijksmuseum temporary windowed partition along restoration work area in the cloister of the church of st trophime arles the care of cultural heritage has long history one that was primarily aimed at fixing and mending objects for their continued use and aesthetic enjoyment until the early th century artists were normally the ones called upon to repair damaged artworks during the th century however the fields of science and art became increasingly intertwined as scientists such as michael faraday began to study the damaging effects of the environment to works of art louis pasteur carried out scientific analysis on paint as well however perhaps the first organized attempt to apply theoretical framework to the conservation of cultural heritage came with the founding in the united kingdom of the society for the protection of ancient buildings in the society was founded by william morris and philip webb both of whom were deeply influenced by the writings of john ruskin during the same period french movement with similar aims was being developed under the direction of eugène viollet le duc an architect and theorist famous for his restorations of medieval buildings since harvard university wraps some of the valuable statues on its campus such as this chinese stele with waterproof covers every winter in order to protect them from erosion caused by acid rain conservation of cultural heritage as distinct field of study initially developed in germany where in friedrich rathgen became the first chemist to be employed by museum the koniglichen museen berlin royal museums of berlin he not only developed scientific approach to the care of objects in the collections but disseminated this approach by publishing handbook of conservation in the early development of conservation of cultural heritage in any area of the world is usually linked to the creation of positions for chemists within museums in british archaeology key research and technical experimentation in conservation was undertaken by women such as ione gedye both in the field and in archaeological collections particularly those of the institute of archaeology london in the united kingdom pioneering research into painting materials and conservation ceramics and stone conservation was conducted by arthur pillans laurie academic chemist and principal of heriot watt university from laurie interests were fostered by william holman hunt in the chemist dr harold plenderleith began to work at the british museum with dr alexander scott in the recently created research laboratory although he was actually employed by the department of scientific and industrial research in the early years plenderleith appointment may be said to have given birth to the conservation profession in the uk although there had been craftsmen in many museums and in the commercial art world for generations this department was created by the museum to address the deteriorating condition of objects in the collection damages which were result of their being stored in the london underground tunnels during the first world war the creation of this department moved the focus for the development of conservation theory and practice from germany to britain and made the latter prime force in this fledgling field in plenderleith wrote significant handbook called the conservation of antiquities and works of art which supplanted rathgen earlier tome and set new standards for the development of art and conservation science in the united states the development of conservation of cultural heritage can be traced to the fogg art museum and edward waldo forbes its director from to he encouraged technical investigation and was chairman of the advisory committee for the first technical journal technical studies in the field of the fine arts published by the fogg from to importantly he also brought onto the museum staff chemists rutherford john gettens was the first of such in
