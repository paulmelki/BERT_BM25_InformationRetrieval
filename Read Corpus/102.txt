abortion is the ending of pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus an abortion that occurs without intervention is known as miscarriage or spontaneous abortion and occurs in approximately to of pregnancies when deliberate steps are taken to end pregnancy it is called an induced abortion or less frequently induced miscarriage the unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion when properly done abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine but unsafe abortion is major cause of maternal death especially in the developing world making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths it is safer than childbirth which has times higher risk of death in the united states modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions the drug mifepristone in combination with prostaglandin appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trimester of pregnancy the most common surgical technique involves dilating the cervix and using suction device birth control such as the pill or intrauterine devices can be used immediately following abortion when performed legally and safely on woman who desires it induced abortions do not increase the risk of long term mental or physical problems in contrast unsafe abortions those performed by unskilled individuals with hazardous equipment or in unsanitary facilities cause deaths and million hospital admissions each year the world health organization recommends safe and legal abortions be available to all women around million abortions are performed each year in the world with about done unsafely abortion rates changed little between and before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased of the world women had access to legal abortions without limits as to reason countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed historically abortions have been attempted using herbal medicines sharp tools forceful massage or through other traditional methods abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world in some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape problems with the fetus poverty risk to woman health or incest there is debate over the moral ethical and legal issues of abortion those who oppose abortion often argue that an embryo or fetus is human with right to life and they may compare abortion to murder those who support the legality of abortion often hold that it is part of woman right to make decisions about her own body others favor legal and accessible abortion as public health measure types induced approximately million pregnancies occur each year worldwide over third are unintended and about fifth end in induced abortion most abortions result from unintended pregnancies in the united kingdom to of abortions are done due to genetic problems in the fetus pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in several ways the manner selected often depends upon the gestational age of the embryo or fetus which increases in size as the pregnancy progresses specific procedures may also be selected due to legality regional availability and doctor or woman personal preference reasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective an abortion is medically referred to as therapeutic abortion when it is performed to save the life of the pregnant woman to prevent harm to the woman physical or mental health to terminate pregnancy where indications are that the child will have significantly increased chance of mortality or morbidity or to selectively reduce the number of fetuses to lessen health risks associated with multiple pregnancy an abortion is referred to as an elective or voluntary abortion when it is performed at the request of the woman for non medical reasons confusion sometimes arises over the term elective because elective surgery generally refers to all scheduled surgery whether medically necessary or not spontaneous miscarriage also known as spontaneous abortion is the unintentional expulsion of an embryo or fetus before the th week of gestation pregnancy that ends before weeks of gestation resulting in live born infant is premature birth or preterm birth when fetus dies in utero after viability or during delivery it is usually termed stillborn premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap only to of conceptions progress past the first trimester the vast majority of those that do not progress are lost before the woman is aware of the conception and many pregnancies are lost before medical practitioners can detect an embryo between and of known pregnancies end in clinically apparent miscarriage depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman of these spontaneous abortions happen in the first trimester the most common cause of spontaneous abortion during the first trimester is chromosomal abnormalities of the embryo or fetus accounting for at least of sampled early pregnancy losses other causes include vascular disease such as lupus diabetes other hormonal problems infection and abnormalities of the uterus advancing maternal age and woman history of previous spontaneous abortions are the two leading factors associated with greater risk of spontaneous abortion spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental trauma intentional trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is considered induced abortion or feticide methods medical medical abortions are those induced by abortifacient pharmaceuticals medical abortion became an alternative method of abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the and the antiprogestogen mifepristone also known as ru in the the most common early first trimester medical abortion regimens use mifepristone in combination with misoprostol or sometimes another prostaglandin analog gemeprost up to weeks days gestational age methotrexate in combination with prostaglandin analog up to weeks gestation or prostaglandin analog alone mifepristone misoprostol combination regimens work faster and are more effective at later gestational ages than methotrexate misoprostol combination regimens and combination regimens are more effective than misoprostol alone this regimen is effective in the second trimester medical abortion regimens involving mifepristone followed by misoprostol in the cheek between and
