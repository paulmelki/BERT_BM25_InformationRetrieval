athanasius of alexandria was traditionally thought to be the author of the athanasian creed and gives his name to its common title the athanasian creed also called the pseudo athanasian creed and sometimes known as quicunque vult or quicumque vult which is both its latin name and opening words meaning whosoever wishes is christian statement of belief focused on trinitarian doctrine and christology the creed has been used by christian churches since the sixth century it is the first creed in which the equality of the three persons of the trinity is explicitly stated it differs from the nicene and apostles creeds in the inclusion of anathemas or condemnations of those who disagree with the creed like the original nicene creed widely accepted among western christians including the roman catholic church as well as some anglican churches lutheran churches it is considered part of lutheran confessions in the book of concord and ancient liturgical churches the athanasian creed has been used in public worship less and less frequently however part of it can be found as an authorized affirmation of faith in the recent common worship liturgy of the church of england in the main volume on page it was designed to distinguish nicene christianity from the heresy of arianism liturgically this creed was recited at the sunday office of prime in the western church it is not in common use in the eastern church the creed has never gained acceptance in liturgy among eastern christians since it was considered as one of many unorthodox fabrications that contained the filioque clause today the athanasian creed is rarely used even in the western church when used one common practice is to use it once year on trinity sunday origin the shield of the trinity visual representation of the doctrine of the trinity derived from the athanasian creed medieval account credited athanasius of alexandria the famous defender of nicene theology as the author of the creed according to that account athanasius composed it during his exile in rome and presented it to pope julius as witness to his orthodoxy the traditional attribution of the creed to athanasius was first called into question in by the dutch protestant theologian gerhard johann vossius it has since been widely accepted by modern scholars that the creed was not authored by athanasius that it was not originally called creed at all and that athanasius name was not originally attached to it athanasius name seems to have become attached to the creed as sign of its strong declaration of trinitarian faith the reasoning for rejecting athanasius as the author usually relies on combination of the following the creed originally was most likely written in latin but athanasius composed in greek neither athanasius nor his contemporaries ever mention the creed it is not mentioned in any records of the ecumenical councils it appears to address theological concerns that developed after athanasius died including the filioque it was most widely circulated among western christians the use of the creed in sermon by caesarius of arles as well as theological resemblance to works by vincent of lérins point to southern gaul as its origin the most likely time frame is in the late fifth or early sixth century ad at least years after athanasius lived the christian theology of the creed is firmly rooted in the augustinian tradition and uses the exact terminology of augustine on the trinity published ad in the late th century there was great deal of speculation about who might have authored the creed with suggestions including ambrose of milan venantius fortunatus and hilary of poitiers the discovery of lost work by vincent of lérins which bears striking similarity to much of the language of the athanasian creed have led many to conclude that the creed originated with vincent or his students for example in the authoritative modern monograph about the creed kelly asserts that vincent of lérins was not its author but that it may have come from the same milieu the area of lérins in southern gaul the oldest surviving manuscripts of the athanasian creed date from the late th century content the athanasian creed is usually divided into two sections lines address the doctrine of the trinity and lines address the doctrine of christology enumerating the three persons of the trinity father the son and the holy spirit the first section of the creed ascribes the divine attributes to each individually thus each person of the trinity is described as uncreated increatus limitless immensus eternal æternus and omnipotent omnipotens while ascribing the divine attributes and divinity to each person of the trinity thus avoiding the first half of the athanasian creed also stresses the unity of the three persons in the one godhead thus avoiding theology of tritheism furthermore although one god the father son and holy spirit are distinct from one another since the father is neither made nor begotten the son is not made but is begotten from the father the holy spirit is neither made nor begotten but proceeds from the father western churches include and the son filioque concept that eastern and oriental orthodox reject the text of the athanasian creed is as follows in latin english translation quicumque vult salvus esse ante omnia opus est ut teneat catholicam fidem quam nisi quisque integram inviolatamque servaverit absque dubio in aeternum peribit fides autem catholica haec est ut unum deum in trinitate et trinitatem in unitate veneremur neque confundentes personas neque substantiam separantes alia est enim persona patris alia filii alia spiritus sancti sed patris et filii et spiritus sancti una est divinitas aequalis gloria coeterna maiestas qualis pater talis filius talis et spiritus sanctus increatus pater increatus filius increatus et spiritus sanctus immensus pater immensus filius immensus et spiritus sanctus aeternus pater aeternus filius aeternus et spiritus sanctus et tamen non tres aeterni sed unus aeternus sicut non tres increati nec tres immensi sed unus increatus et unus immensus similiter omnipotens pater omnipotens filius omnipotens et spiritus sanctus et
