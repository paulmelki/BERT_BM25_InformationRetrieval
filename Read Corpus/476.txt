agesilaus ii agesilaos bc was king basileus of the ancient greek city state of sparta and member of the eurypontid dynasty ruling from to about bc during most of which time he was in plutarch words as good as though commander and king of all greece and was for the whole of it greatly identified with his country deeds and fortunes small in stature and lame from birth agesilaus became ruler somewhat unexpectedly in his mid forties his reign saw successful military incursions into various states in asia minor as well as successes in the corinthian war however several diplomatic decisions resulted in sparta becoming increasingly isolated prior to his death at the age of in cyrenaica agesilaus was greatly admired by his friend the historian xenophon who wrote minor work about him titled agesilaus life early life agesilaus was the son of archidamus ii and his second wife eupoleia brother to cynisca the first woman in ancient history to achieve an olympic victory and younger half brother of agis ii there is little surviving detail on the youth of agesilaus born with one leg shorter he was not expected to succeed to the throne after his brother king agis ii especially because the latter had son leotychidas therefore agesilaus was trained in the traditional curriculum of sparta the agoge however leotychidas was ultimately set aside as illegitimate contemporary rumors representing him as the son of alcibiades and agesilaus became king in at the age of about forty in addition to questions of his nephew paternity agesilaus succession was largely due to the intervention of the spartan general lysander who hoped to find in him willing tool for the furtherance of his political designs lysander and the young agesilaus came to maintain an intimate relation see pederasty in ancient greece as was common of the period their unique relationship would serve an important role during agesilaus later campaigns in asia minor early reign invasion of achaemenid

sarcophagus early th century bce on his arrival at ephesus in bc three months truce was concluded with tissaphernes the satrap of lydia and caria but negotiations conducted during that time proved fruitless and on its termination agesilaus raided hellespontine phrygia where he easily won immense booty from the satrap pharnabazus tissaphernes could offer no assistance as he had concentrated his troops in caria in these campaigns agesilaus also benefited from the aid of some of the ten thousand greek mercenary army who had marched through miles of persian territory to reach the black sea few years earlier bc after spending the winter organizing cavalry force hippeis he made successful incursion into lydia in the spring of tithraustes was sent to replace tissaphernes who paid with his life for his continued failure meeting between spartan king agesilaus left and pharnabazus ii right in bc when agesilaus agreed to remove himself from hellespontine phrygia an armistice was concluded between tithraustes and agesilaus who left the southern satrapy and again invaded hellespontine phrygia which he ravaged until the following spring he then came to an agreement with pharnabazus whom he met personally and once more turned southward during these campaigns lysander attempted to manipulate agesilaus into ceding his authority agesilaus would have nothing of this and reminded lysander who was only spartan general who was king he had lysander sent away to assist the naval campaigns in the aegean this dominating move by agesilaus earned the respect of his men at arms and of lysander
