an ansible is category of fictional devices or technology capable of near instantaneous or faster than light communication it can send and receive messages to and from corresponding device over any distance or obstacle whatsoever with no delay even between star systems as name for such device the word ansible first appeared in novel by ursula le guin since that time the term has been broadly used in the works of numerous science fiction authors across variety of settings and continuities coinage by ursula le guin ursula le guin coined the word ansible in her novel rocannon world the word was contraction of answerable as the device would allow its users to receive answers to their messages in reasonable amount of time even over interstellar distances the plot device of the ansible was the basis for creating specific kind of interstellar civilization one where communications between far flung stars are instantaneous but humans can only travel at relativistic speeds under these conditions full fledged galactic empire is not possible but there is looser interstellar organization in which several of le guin protagonists are involved although le guin invented the name ansible for this type of device fleshed out with specific details in her fictional works the broader concept of instantaneous or faster than light communication had previously existed in science fiction for example similar communication functions were included in device called an interocitor in the novel this island earth by raymond jones and the film based on that novel and in the dirac communicator which first appeared in james blish short story beep which was later expanded into the novel the quincunx of time robert heinlein in time for the stars employed instantaneous telepathic communication between identical twin pairs over interstellar distances and like le guin provided technical explanation based on non einsteinian principle of simultaneity in le guin works in her subsequent works le guin continued to develop the concept of the ansible in the left hand of darkness le guin describes that the ansible doesn involve radio waves or any form of energy the principle it works on the constant of simultaneity is analogous in some ways to gravity one point has to be fixed on planet of certain mass but the other end is portable in the word for world is forest le guin explains that in order for communication to work with any pair of ansibles at least one must be on large mass body the other can be anywhere in the cosmos in the dispossessed le guin tells of the development of the theory leading up to the ansible any ansible may be used to communicate through any other by setting its coordinates to those of the receiving ansible they have limited bandwidth which only allows for at most few hundred characters of text to be communicated in any transaction of dialog session and are attached to keyboard and small display to perform text messaging use by later authors since le guin conception of the ansible the name of the device has been borrowed by numerous authors while le guin ansible was said to communicate instantaneously the name has also been adopted for devices capable of communication at finite speeds that are faster than light orson scott card works orson scott card in his novelette and novel ender game and its sequels used the term ansible as an unofficial name for the philotic parallax instantaneous communicator machine capable of communicating across infinite distances with no time delay in ender game character states that somebody dredged the name ansible out of an old book somewhere in the universe of the ender game series the ansible functions involved fictional subatomic particle the philote the two quarks inside pi meson can be separated by an arbitrary distance while remaining connected by philotic rays this concept is similar to quantum teleportation due to entanglement however in reality quark confinement prevents quarks from being separated by any observable distance card version of the ansible was also featured in the video game advent rising for which card helped write the story and in the movie ender game which was based on the book other writers numerous other writers have included faster than light communication devices in their fictional works notable examples include vernor vinge in the short story the blabber elizabeth moon in the novel winning colors philip pullman in the novel the amber spyglass part of the his dark materials trilogy jason jones in the computer game marathon durandal graf in the star trek deep space nine novel time enemy neal asher in his polity series of novels including gridlinked in which the runcible named in homage to the ansible is an interstellar wormhole generator teleporter dan simmons in the novel ilium liu cixin in the trilogy remembrance of earth past kim stanley robinson in the novel becky chambers in the novel the long way to small angry planet neon yang
