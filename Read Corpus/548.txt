alyattes greek aluáttēs likely from lydian reigned bc sometimes described as alyattes was the fourth king of the mermnad dynasty in lydia the son of sadyattes and grandson of ardys he died after reign of years and was succeeded by his son croesus battle between his forces and those of cyaxares king of media was interrupted by the solar eclipse of may bc after this truce was agreed and alyattes married his daughter aryenis to astyages the son of cyaxares the alliance preserved lydia for another generation during which it enjoyed its most brilliant period alyattes continued to wage war against miletus for many years but eventually he heeded the delphic oracle and rebuilt temple dedicated to athena which his soldiers had destroyed he then made peace with miletus alyattes was the first monarch who issued coins made from electrum and his successor croesus was the first to issue gold coins alyattes is therefore sometimes mentioned as the originator of coinage or of currency the greek form is most likely derived from name with initial digamma walwattes from lydian lydian alphabet chronology file electrum trite alyattes ii lydia bc jpg thumb upright electrum trite alyattes lydia bce inscribed kukalim dates for the mermnad kings are uncertain and are based on computation by bury and russell meiggs who estimated bc for the reign of gyges herodotus gave reign lengths for gyges successors but there is uncertainty about these as the total exceeds the timespan between probable death of gyges fighting the cimmerians and fall of sardis to cyrus the great bury and meiggs concluded that ardys and sadyattes reigned through an unspecified period in the second half of the th century bc but they did not propose dates for alyattes except their assertion that his son croesus succeeded him in bc the timespan bc for the reign of croesus is almost certainly accurate life for several years alyattes continued the war against the greek colony of miletus begun by his father sadyattes but was obliged to turn his attention towards the medes and babylonians on may bc during the battle of halys fought against cyaxares king of media solar eclipse occurred hostilities were suspended peace concluded and the halys river was fixed as the boundary between the two kingdoms alyattes drove the cimmerians from asia minor with the help of war dogs he further subdued the carians and took several ionian cities including smyrna and colophon smyrna was sacked and destroyed with its inhabitants forced to move into the countryside he created the first coins in history made from electrum naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver the weight of either precious metal could not just be weighed so they contained an imprint that identified the issuer who guaranteed the value of its contents today we still use token currency where the value is guaranteed by the state and not by the value of the metal used in the coins almost all coins used today descended from his invention after the technology passed into greek usage through hermodike ii greek princess from cyme who was likely one of his wives assuming he was referred to dynastic midas because of the wealth his coinage amassed and because the electrum was sourced from midas famed river pactolus she was also likely the mother of croesus see croeseid symbolism he standardised the weight of coins stater grains of wheat the coins were produced using an anvil die technique and stamped with lion head the symbol of the mermnadae tomb tumuli ever built with diameter of meters and height of meters tomb of alyattes th

huge stones it was excavated by spiegelthal in who found that it covered large vault of finely cut marble blocks approached by flat roofed passage of the same stone from the south the sarcophagus and its contents had been removed by early plunderers of the tomb all that was left were some broken alabaster vases pottery and charcoal on the summit of the mound were large phalli of stone herodotus described the tomb some authors have suggested that buddhist stupas were derived from wider cultural tradition from the mediterranean to the indus valley and can be related to the funeral conical mounds on circular bases that can be found in lydia or in phoenicia from the th century bce such as the tomb of alyattes file alyattes tumulus reconstitution jpg alyattes tumulus reconstitution file

the histories herodotus recounts how alyattes continued his father war against miletus according to herodotus sadyattes had invaded miletus annually to burn their crops over the course of six years the troops left the horses and houses untouched so that the milesians could plant new crop which the lydians would then burn the following year alyattes did the same over the next five years until the end of the war the end came about because of lydian fire which driven out of control by strong wind destroyed the temple of athene at assesos soon afterwards alyattes became seriously ill and decided to asked the delphic oracle for advice the priestess refused to answer his emissary until the lydians had rebuilt the temple alyattes immediately sent an embassy to miletus and agreed peace treaty the
