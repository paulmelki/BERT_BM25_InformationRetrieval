topography of the amazon river basin the amazon river in south america is the largest river by discharge volume of water in the world and the disputed longest river in the world the headwaters of the apurímac river on nevado mismi had been considered for nearly century as the amazon most distant source until study found it to be the headwaters of the mantaro river on the cordillera rumi cruz in peru the mantaro and apurímac rivers join and with other tributaries form the ucayali river which in turn meets the marañón river upstream of iquitos peru they form what countries other than brazil consider to be the main stem of the amazon brazilians call this section the solimões river above its confluence with the rio negro forming what brazilians call the amazon at the meeting of waters at manaus the largest city on the river at an average discharge of about approximately greater than the next seven largest independent rivers combined the amazon represents of the global riverine discharge to the ocean the amazon basin is the largest drainage basin in the world with an area of approximately the portion of the river drainage basin in brazil alone is larger than any other river basin the amazon enters brazil with only one fifth of the flow it finally discharges into the atlantic ocean yet already has greater flow at this point than the discharge of any other river origin of the name the amazon was initially known by europeans as the marañón and the peruvian part of the river is still known by that name today it later became known as rio amazonas in spanish and portuguese and amazon river in english the name rio amazonas was reportedly given after native warriors attacked th century expedition by francisco de orellana the warriors were led by women reminding de orellana of the amazon warriors tribe of women warriors related to iranian scythians and sarmatians mentioned in greek mythology the word amazon itself may be derived from the iranian compound ha maz an one fighting together or ethnonym ha mazan warriors word attested indirectly through derivation denominal verb in hesychius of alexandria gloss to make war in persian where it appears together with the indo iranian root kar make from which sanskrit karma is also derived however other scholars insist that the name is derived from the native american word amassona meaning boat destroyer history pre columbian era old drawing from of arapaima fishing at the amazon river during what many archaeologists called the formative stage amazonian societies were deeply involved in the emergence of south america highland agrarian systems the trade with andean civilizations in the terrains of the headwaters in the andes formed an essential contribution to the social and religious development of higher altitude civilizations like the muisca and incas early human settlements were typically based on low lying hills or mounds shell mounds were the earliest evidence of habitation they represent piles of human refuse and are mainly dated between and years bp they are associated with ceramic age cultures no preceramic shell mounds have been documented so far by archaeologists artificial earth platforms for entire villages are the second type of mounds they are best represented by the marajoara culture figurative mounds are the most recent types of occupation there is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the amazon river were home to complex and large scale indigenous societies mainly chiefdoms who developed towns and cities archaeologists estimate that by the time the spanish conquistador de orellana traveled across the amazon in more than million indigenous people lived around the amazon these pre columbian settlements created highly developed civilizations for instance pre columbian indigenous people on the island of marajó may have developed social stratification and supported population of people to achieve this level of development the indigenous inhabitants of the amazon rainforest altered the forest ecology by selective cultivation and the use of fire scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repetitiously the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients this created dark soil areas known as terra preta de índio indian dark earth because of the terra preta indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures further research has hypothesized that this practice began around years ago some say that its effects on forest ecology and regional climate explain the otherwise inexplicable band of lower rainfall through the amazon basin many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare james stuart olson wrote the munduruku expansion dislocated and displaced the kawahíb breaking the tribe down into much smaller groups munduruku first came to the attention of europeans in when they began series of widespread attacks on brazilian settlements along the amazon river arrival of europeans amazon tributaries near manaus in march spanish conquistador vicente yáñez pinzón was the first documented european to sail up the amazon river pinzón called the stream río santa maría del mar dulce later shortened to mar dulce literally sweet sea because of its freshwater pushing out into the ocean another spanish explorer francisco de orellana was the first european to travel from the origins of the upstream river basins situated in the andes to the mouth of the river in this journey orellana baptized some of the affluents of the amazonas like rio negro napo and jurua the name amazonas is thought to be taken from the native warriors that attacked this expedition mostly women that reminded de orellana of the mythical female amazon warriors from the ancient hellenic culture in greece see also origin of the name exploration samuel fritz map showing the amazon and the orinoco gonzalo
