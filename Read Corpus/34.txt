in mathematics and statistics the arithmetic mean stress on first and third syllables of arithmetic or simply the mean or the average when the context is clear is the sum of collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection the collection is often set of results of an experiment or an observational study or frequently set of results from survey the term arithmetic mean is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other means such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean in addition to mathematics and statistics the arithmetic mean is used frequently in many diverse fields such as economics anthropology and history and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent for example per capita income is the arithmetic average income of nation population while the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies it is not robust statistic meaning that it is greatly influenced by outliers values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values for skewed distributions such as the distribution of income for which few people incomes are substantially greater than most people the arithmetic mean may not coincide with one notion of middle and robust statistics such as the median may provide better description of central tendency definition given data set the arithmetic mean or mean or average denoted read bar is the mean of the values the arithmetic mean is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency in data set in statistics the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency the arithmetic mean of set of observed data is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation divided by the total number of observations symbolically if we have data set consisting of the values then the arithmetic mean is defined by the formula for an explanation of the summation operator see summation for example consider the monthly salary of employees of firm the arithmetic mean is if the data set is statistical population consists of every possible observation and not just subset of them then the mean of that population is called the population mean and denoted by the greek letter if the data set is statistical sample subset of the population then we call the statistic resulting from this calculation sample mean which for data set is denoted as the arithmetic mean can be similarly defined for vectors in multiple dimension not only scalar values this is often referred to as centroid more generally because the arithmetic mean is convex combination coefficients sum to it can be defined on convex space not only vector space motivating properties the arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful especially as measure of central tendency these include if numbers have mean then since is the distance from given number to the mean one way to interpret this property is as saying that the numbers to the left of the mean are balanced by the numbers to the right of the mean the mean is the only single number for which the residuals deviations from the estimate sum to zero if it is required to use single number as typical value for set of known numbers then the arithmetic mean of the numbers does this best in the sense of minimizing the sum of squared deviations from the typical value the sum of it follows that the sample mean is also the best single predictor in the sense of having the lowest root mean squared error if the arithmetic mean of population of numbers is desired then the estimate of it that is unbiased is the arithmetic mean of sample drawn from the population contrast with median the arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median the median is defined such that no more than half the values are larger than and no more than half are smaller than the median if elements in the data increase arithmetically when placed in some order then the median and arithmetic average are equal for example consider the data sample the average is as is the median however when we consider sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically such as the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly in this case the arithmetic average is while the median is in general the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample and can be larger or smaller than most of them there are applications of this phenomenon in many fields for example since the the median income in the united states has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income generalizations weighted average weighted average or weighted mean is an average in which some data points count more heavily than others in that they are given more weight in the calculation for example the arithmetic mean of and is or equivalently in contrast weighted mean in which the first number receives for example twice as much weight as the second perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled would be calculated as here the weights which necessarily sum to the value one are and the former being twice the latter the arithmetic mean sometimes called the unweighted average or equally weighted average can be interpreted as special case of weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other equal to in the above example and equal to in situation with numbers being averaged continuous probability distributions comparison of two log normal distributions with equal median but different skewness resulting in different means and modes if numerical property and any sample of data from it could take on any value from continuous range instead of for example just integers then the probability of number falling into some range of possible values can
