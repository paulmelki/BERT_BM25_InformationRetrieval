andré weil may august was french mathematician known for his foundational work in number theory and algebraic geometry he was founding member and the de facto early leader of the mathematical bourbaki group the philosopher simone weil was his sister the writer sylvie weil is his daughter life andré weil was born in paris to agnostic alsatian jewish parents who fled the annexation of alsace lorraine by the german empire after the franco prussian war in the famous philosopher simone weil was weil only sibling he studied in paris rome and göttingen and received his doctorate in while in germany weil befriended carl ludwig siegel starting in he spent two academic years at aligarh muslim university aside from mathematics weil held lifelong interests in classical greek and latin literature in hinduism and sanskrit literature he taught himself sanskrit in after teaching for one year at aix marseille university he taught for six years at university of strasbourg he married éveline de possel née éveline gillet in weil was in finland when world war ii broke out he had been traveling in scandinavia since april his wife éveline returned to france without him weil was mistakenly arrested in finland at the outbreak of the winter war on suspicion of spying however accounts of his life having been in danger were shown to be exaggerated weil returned to france via sweden and the united kingdom and was detained at le havre in january he was charged with failure to report for duty and was imprisoned in le havre and then rouen it was in the military prison in bonne nouvelle district of rouen from february to may that weil completed the work that made his reputation he was tried on may sentenced to five years he requested to be attached to military unit instead and was given the chance to join regiment in cherbourg after the fall of france he met up with his family in marseille where he arrived by sea he then went to clermont ferrand where he managed to join his wife éveline who had been living in german occupied france in january weil and his family sailed from marseille to new york he spent the remainder of the war in the united states where he was supported by the rockefeller foundation and the guggenheim foundation for two years he taught undergraduate mathematics at lehigh university where he was unappreciated overworked and poorly paid although he did not have to worry about being drafted unlike his american students he quit the job at lehigh and moved to brazil where he taught at the universidade de são paulo from to working with oscar zariski weil and his wife had two daughters sylvie born in and nicolette born in he then returned to the united states and taught at the university of chicago from to before moving to the institute for advanced study where he would spend the remainder of his career he was plenary speaker at the icm in in cambridge massachusetts in in amsterdam and in in helsinki in weil shared the second wolf prize in mathematics with jean leray work weil made substantial contributions in number of areas the most important being his discovery of profound connections between algebraic geometry and number theory this began in his doctoral work leading to the mordell weil theorem and shortly applied in siegel theorem on integral points mordell theorem had an ad hoc proof weil began the separation of the infinite descent argument into two types of structural approach by means of height functions for sizing rational points and by means of galois cohomology which would not be categorized as such for another two decades both aspects of weil work have steadily developed into substantial theories among his major accomplishments were the proof of the riemann hypothesis for zeta functions of curves over finite fields and his subsequent laying of proper foundations for algebraic geometry to support that result from to most intensively the so called weil conjectures were hugely influential from around these statements were later proved by bernard dwork alexander grothendieck michael artin and finally by pierre deligne who completed the most difficult step in weil introduced the adele ring in the late following claude chevalley lead with the ideles and gave proof of the riemann roch theorem with them version appeared in his basic number theory in his matrix divisor vector bundle avant la lettre riemann roch theorem from was very early anticipation of later ideas such as moduli spaces of bundles the weil conjecture on tamagawa numbers proved resistant for many years eventually the adelic approach became basic in automorphic representation theory he picked up another credited weil conjecture around which later under pressure from serge lang resp of serre became known as the taniyama shimura conjecture resp taniyama weil conjecture based on roughly formulated question of taniyama at the nikkō conference his attitude towards conjectures was that one should not dignify guess as conjecture lightly and in the taniyama case the evidence was only there after extensive computational work carried out from the late other significant results were on pontryagin duality and differential geometry he introduced the concept of uniform space in general topology as by product of his collaboration with nicolas bourbaki of which he was founding father his work on sheaf theory hardly appears in his published papers but correspondence with henri cartan in the late and reprinted in his collected papers proved most influential he also chose the symbol derived from the letter in the norwegian alphabet which he alone among the bourbaki group was familiar with to represent the empty set weil also made well known contribution in riemannian geometry in his very first paper in when he showed that the classical isoperimetric inequality holds on non positively curved surfaces this established the dimensional case of what later became known as the cartan hadamard conjecture he discovered that the so called weil representation previously introduced in quantum mechanics by irving segal and
