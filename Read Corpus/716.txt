approximants are speech sounds that involve the articulators approaching each other but not narrowly enough nor with enough articulatory precision to create turbulent airflow therefore approximants fall between fricatives which do produce turbulent airstream and vowels which produce no turbulence this class is composed of sounds like as in rest and semivowels like and as in yes and west respectively as well as lateral approximants like as in less terminology before peter ladefoged coined the term approximant in the the term frictionless continuant referred to non lateral approximants in phonology approximant is also distinctive feature that encompasses all sonorants except nasals including vowels taps and trills semivowels some approximants resemble vowels in acoustic and articulatory properties and the terms semivowel and glide are often used for these non syllabic vowel like segments the correlation between semivowels and vowels is strong enough that cross language differences between semivowels correspond with the differences between their related vowels vowels and their corresponding semivowels alternate in many languages depending on the phonological environment or for grammatical reasons as is the case with indo european ablaut similarly languages often avoid configurations where semivowel precedes its corresponding vowel number of phoneticians distinguish between semivowels and approximants by their location in syllable although he uses the terms interchangeably remarks that for example the final glides of english par and buy differ from french par through and baille tub in that in the latter pair the approximants appear in the syllable coda whereas in the former they appear in the syllable nucleus this means that opaque if not minimal contrasts can occur in languages like italian with the like sound of piede foot appearing in the nucleus and that of piano slow appearing in the syllable onset and spanish with near minimal pair being abyecto abject and abierto opened approximant vowel correspondences vowel place of articulation example palatal spanish ampl extend vs ampl ió he extended labiopalatal french aig sharp vs aig ille needle velar labiovelar spanish contin continue vs contin he continued pharyngeal postalveolar retroflex english wait er vs wait ess because of the articulatory complexities of the american english rhotic there is some variation in its phonetic description transcription with the ipa character for an alveolar approximant is common though the sound is more postalveolar actual retroflexion may occur as well and both occur as variations of the same sound however makes distinction between the vowels of american english which he calls rhotacized and vowels with retroflexion such as those that appear in badaga on the other hand labels both as colored and notes that both have lowered third formant because the vowels are articulated with spread lips spreading is implied for their approximant analogues however these sounds generally have little or no lip spreading the fricative letters with lowering diacritic may therefore be justified for neutral articulation between spread and rounded in articulation and often diachronically palatal approximants correspond to front vowels velar approximants to back vowels and labialized approximants to rounded vowels in american english the rhotic approximant corresponds to the rhotic vowel this can create alternations as shown in the above table in addition to alternations glides can be inserted to the left or the right of their corresponding vowels when they occur next to hiatus for example in ukrainian medial triggers the formation of an inserted that acts as syllable onset so that when the affix is added to футбол football to make футболіст football player it is pronounced but маоїст maoist with the same affix is pronounced with glide dutch for many speakers has similar process that extends to mid vowels bioscoop cinema zee en seas fluor fluor reu en male dogs rwanda rwanda boaz boaz similarly vowels can be inserted next to their corresponding glide in certain phonetic environments sievers law describes this behaviour for germanic non high semivowels also occur in colloquial nepali speech process of glide formation occurs where one of two adjacent vowels becomes non syllabic the process includes mid vowels so that cause to wish features non syllabic mid vowel spanish features similar process and even nonsyllabic can occur so that ahorita right away is pronounced it is not often clear however whether such sequences involve semivowel consonant or diphthong vowel and in many cases it may not be meaningful distinction although many languages have central vowels which lie between back velar and front palatal there are few cases of corresponding approximant one is in the korean diphthong or though it is more frequently analyzed as velar as in the table above and mapudungun may be another with three high vowel sounds and three corresponding consonants and and third one is often described as voiced unrounded velar fricative some texts note correspondence between this approximant and that is parallel to and an example is liq white approximants versus fricatives in addition to less turbulence approximants also differ from fricatives in the precision required to produce them when emphasized approximants may be slightly fricated that is the airstream may become slightly turbulent which is reminiscent of fricatives for example the spanish word ayuda help features palatal approximant that is pronounced as fricative in emphatic speech spanish can be analyzed as having meaningful distinction between fricative approximant and intermediate however such frication is generally slight and intermittent unlike the strong turbulence of fricative consonants because voicelessness has comparatively reduced resistance to air flow from the lungs the increased air flow creates more turbulence making acoustic distinctions between voiceless approximants which are extremely rare cross linguistically and voiceless fricatives difficult this is why for example no language is known to contrast the voiceless labialized velar approximant also transcribed with the special letter with voiceless labialized velar fricative similarly standard tibetan has voiceless lateral approximant and welsh has voiceless lateral fricative but the distinction is not always clear from descriptions of these languages again no language is known to contrast the two iaai is reported to have an unusually large number of voiceless approximants with for places of articulation further
