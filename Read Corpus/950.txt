there are methods for managing depression which do not involve medications or may be used in conjunction with medications medical uses antidepressants are used to treat major depressive disorder and of other conditions including some anxiety disorders some chronic pain conditions and to help manage some addictions antidepressants are often used in combinations with one another the proponents of the monoamine hypothesis of depression recommend choosing the antidepressant with the mechanism of action impacting the most prominent symptoms for example they advocate that people with mdd who are

major depressive disorder the uk national institute for health and care excellence nice guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be routinely used for the initial treatment of mild depression because the risk benefit ratio is poor the guidelines recommended that antidepressant treatment be considered for people with history of moderate or severe depression those with mild depression that has been present for long period as second line treatment for mild depression that persists after other interventions as first line treatment for moderate or severe depression the guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be used in combination with psychosocial interventions in most cases should be continued for at least six months to reduce the risk of relapse and that ssris are typically better tolerated than other antidepressants american psychiatric association treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors that include severity of symptoms co existing disorders prior treatment experience and the person preference options may include pharmacotherapy psychotherapy therapy ect transcranial

such as education and self help activities gad is common disorder of which the central feature is excessive worry about number of different events key symptoms include excessive anxiety about multiple events and issues and difficulty controlling worrisome thoughts that persists for at least months antidepressants provide modest to moderate reduction in anxiety in gad the efficacy of different antidepressants is similar social anxiety disorder some antidepressants are used as treatment for social anxiety disorder but their efficacy is not entirely convincing as only small proportion of antidepressants showed some efficacy for this condition paroxetine was the first drug to be fda approved for this disorder its efficacy is considered beneficial although not everyone responds favorably to the drug sertraline and fluvoxamine extended release were later approved for it as well while escitalopram is used off label with acceptable efficacy however there isn enough evidence to support citalopram for treating social phobia and fluoxetine was no better than placebo in clinical trials ssris are used as first line treatment for social anxiety but they don work for everyone one alternative would be venlafaxine which is snri it showed benefits for social phobia in five clinical trials against placebo while the other snris are not considered particularly useful for this disorder as many of them didn undergo testing for it as of now it is unclear if duloxetine and desvenlafaxine can provide benefits for social anxiety sufferers however another class of antidepressants called maois are considered effective for social anxiety but they come with many unwanted side effects and are rarely used phenelzine was shown to be good treatment option but its use is limited by dietary restrictions moclobemide is rima and showed mixed results but still got approval in some european countries for social anxiety disorder tca antidepressants such as clomipramine and imipramine are not considered effective for this anxiety disorder in particular this leaves out ssris such as paroxetine sertraline and fluvoxamine cr as acceptable and tolerated treatment options for this disorder obsessive compulsive disorder ssris are second line treatment of adult obsessive compulsive disorder ocd with mild functional impairment and as first line treatment for those with moderate or severe impairment in children ssris are considered as second line therapy in those with moderate to severe impairment with close monitoring for psychiatric adverse effects ssris appear useful for ocd at least in the short term efficacy has been demonstrated both in short term treatment trials of to weeks and in discontinuation trials of to weeks duration clomipramine tca drug is considered effective and useful for ocd however it is used as second line treatment because it is less well tolerated than the ssris despite this it has not shown superiority to fluvoxamine in trials all ssris can be used effectively for ocd and in some cases snris can also be tried even though none of them is approved specifically for ocd
