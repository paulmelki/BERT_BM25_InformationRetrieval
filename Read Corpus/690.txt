elphinstone army during the first anglo afghan war in partisans during the january uprising an ambush is long established military tactic in which combatants take advantage of concealment and the element of surprise to attack unsuspecting enemy combatants from concealed positions such as among dense underbrush or behind hilltops ambushes have been used consistently throughout history from ancient to modern warfare in the th century an ambush might involve thousands of soldiers on large scale such as over choke point such as mountain pass or small irregular band or insurgent group attacking regular armed force patrol theoretically single well armed and concealed soldier could ambush other troops in surprise attack sometimes an ambush can involve the exclusive or combined use of improvised explosive devices that allow the attackers to hit enemy convoys or patrols while minimizing the risk of being exposed to return fire history the use by early humans of the ambush may date as far back as two million years when anthropologists have recently suggested that ambush techniques were used to hunt large game one example from ancient times is the battle of the trebia river hannibal encamped within striking distance of the romans with the trebia river between them and placed strong force of cavalry and infantry in concealment near the battle zone he had noticed says polybius place between the two camps flat indeed and treeless but well adapted for an ambuscade as it was traversed by water course with steep banks densely overgrown with brambles and other thorny plants and here he proposed to lay stratagem to surprise the enemy when the roman infantry became entangled in combat with his army the hidden ambush force attacked the legionnaires in the rear the result was slaughter and defeat for the romans nevertheless the battle also displays the effects of good tactical discipline on the part of the ambushed force although most of the legions were lost about romans cut their way through to safety maintaining unit cohesion this ability to maintain discipline and break out or maneuver away from kill zone is hallmark of good troops and training in any ambush situation see ranger reference below ambushes were widely utilized by the lusitanians in particular by their chieftain viriathus their usual tactic called concursare involved repeatedly charging and retreating forcing the enemy to eventually give them chase in order to set up ambushes in difficult terrain where allied forces would be awaiting in his first victory he eluded the siege of roman praetor gaius vetilius and attracted him to narrow pass next to the barbesuda river where he destroyed his army and killed the praetor viriathus ability to turn chases into ambushes would grant him victories over number of roman generals another famous lusitanian ambush was performed by curius and apuleius on roman general quintus fabius maximus servilianus who led numerically superior army complete with war elephants and numidian cavalry the ambush allowed curius and apuleius to steal servilianus loot train although tactic error in their retreat led to the romans retaking the train and putting the lusitanians to flight viriathus later defeated servilianus with surprise attack possibly the most famous ambush in ancient warfare was that sprung by germanic warchief arminius against the romans at battle of the teutoburg forest this particular ambush was to affect the course of western history the germanic forces demonstrated several principles needed for successful ambush they took cover in difficult forested terrain allowing the warriors time and space to mass without detection they had the element of surprise and this was also aided by the defection of arminius from roman ranks prior to the battle they sprang the attack when the romans were most vulnerable when they had left their fortified camp and were on the march in pounding rainstorm the germans did not dawdle at the hour of decision but attacked quickly using massive series of short rapid vicious charges against the length of the whole roman line with charging units sometimes withdrawing to the forest to regroup while others took their place the germans also used blocking obstacles erecting trench and earthen wall to hinder roman movement along the route of the killing zone the result was mass slaughter of the romans and the destruction of three legions the germanic victory caused limit on roman expansion in the west ultimately it established the rhine as the boundary of the roman empire for the next four hundred years until the decline of the roman influence in the west the roman empire made no further concerted attempts to conquer germania beyond the rhine there are many notable examples of ambushes during the roman persian wars year after their victory at carrhae the parthians invaded syria but were driven back after roman ambush near antigonia roman emperor julian was mortally wounded in an ambush near samarra in during the retreat from his persian campaign byzantine invasion of persian armenia was repelled by small force at anglon who performed meticulous ambush
