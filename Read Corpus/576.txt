ambiorix gaulish king of the surroundings or king protector was together with cativolcus prince of the eburones leader of belgic tribe of north eastern gaul gallia belgica where modern belgium is located in the nineteenth century ambiorix became belgian national hero because of his resistance against julius caesar as written in caesar commentarii de bello gallico name it is generally accepted that ambiorix is gaulish personal name formed with the prefix ambio attached to rix king the meaning of the first element is debated lindeman interprets ambio gaulish protector ruler as stemming from the proto indo european compound h₂mbhí péh₃ protector compare with old indic adhi pá protector ruler master king leading to ambio rix as the protector king delamarre argues that ambio enclosure compare with old irish imbe enclosure is thematized form of the gaulish prefix ambi around on both sides in this view ambiorix could be translated as the king of the enclosure or the king of the surroundings biography early history in bc julius caesar conquered parts of gaul and also belgica belgium modern day northern france luxembourg part of present day netherlands below the rhine river and the north western portion of north rhine westphalia germany there were several tribes in the country who fought against each other frequently the eburones were ruled by ambiorix and catuvolcus in bc caesar troops urgently needed more food and so the local tribes were forced to give up part of their harvest which had not been good that year understandably the starving eburones were reluctant to do so and caesar ordered that camps be built near the eburones villages each centurion was ordered to make sure the food supplies were delivered to the roman soldiers this created resentment among the eburones although julius caesar had freed him from paying tribute to the atuatuci ambiorix joined catuvolcus in the winter of bc in an uprising against the roman forces under titurius sabinus and aurunculeius cotta resisting the romans ambiorix attacking roman soldiers relief at the liège provincial palace because drought had disrupted his grain supply caesar was forced to winter his legions among the rebellious belgic tribes roman troops led by titurius sabinus and aurunculeius cotta were wintering among the eburones when they were attacked by them led by ambiorix and cativolcus ambiorix deceived the romans telling them the attack was made without his consent and further advised them to flee as large germanic force was preparing to cross the rhine trusting ambiorix sabinus and cotta troops left the next morning short distance from their camp the roman troops were ambushed by the eburones and massacred elsewhere another roman force under tullius cicero brother of the orator marcus were wintering amongst the nervii leading coalition of rebellious belgic tribes ambiorix surrounded cicero camp after long while roman messenger was finally able to slip through the belgic lines and get word of the uprising to caesar mobilizing his legions caesar immediately marched to cicero aid as they approached the besieged roman camp the belgae moved to engage caesar troops vastly outnumbered caesar ordered his troops to appear confused and frightened and they successfully lured the belgae to attack them on ground favourable to the romans caesar forces launched fierce counterattack and soon put the belgae to flight later caesar troops entered cicero camp to find most of the men wounded meanwhile indutiomarus leader of the treveri began to harass labienus camp daily eventually provoking labienus to send out his cavalry with specific orders to kill indutiomarus they did so and routed the remnants of indutiomarus army caesar personally remained in gaul for the remainder of winter due to the renewed gallic threat caesar revenge when the roman senate heard what had happened caesar swore to destroy all the belgic tribes ambiorix had killed fifteen cohorts belgic attack on tullius cicero then stationed with legion in the territory of the nervii failed due to the timely appearance of caesar the roman campaigns against the belgae took few years but eventually the tribes were slaughtered or driven out and their fields burned the eburones disappeared from history after this genocidal event according to the writer florus ambiorix and his men succeeded in escaping across the rhine they do not appear in roman records after this point legacy caesar wrote about ambiorix in his commentary about his battles against the gauls de bello gallico in this text he also wrote the famous line of these three regions the belgae are the bravest horum omnium fortissimi sunt belgae ambiorix remained relatively obscure figure until the nineteenth century when belgium became independent in the national government started searching through their historical archives for people who could serve as national heroes in caesar de bello gallico ambiorix and his deeds were rediscovered in the belgian poet joannes nolet de brauwere van steeland wrote lyrical epic about ambiorix furthermore on september statue of ambiorix was erected on the main market square
