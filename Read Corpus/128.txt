altaic is sprachbund linguistic area or proposed language family that would include the turkic mongolian and tungusic language families and possibly also the japonic and koreanic languages speakers of these languages are currently scattered over most of asia north of and in some eastern parts of europe extending in longitude from turkey to japan the group is named after the altai mountain range in the center of asia the hypothetical language family has long been rejected by most comparative linguists but still has some supporters the altaic family was first proposed in the th century it was widely accepted until the and is still listed in many encyclopedias and handbooks since the many comparative linguists have rejected the proposal after supposed cognates were found not to be valid hypothesized sound shifts were not found and turkic and mongolic languages were found to be converging rather than diverging over the centuries opponents of the theory proposed that the similarities are due to mutual linguistic influences between the groups concerned the original hypothesis unified only the turkic mongolian and tungusic groups later proposals to include the korean and japanese languages into macro altaic family have always been controversial the original proposal was sometimes called micro altaic by retronymy most proponents of altaic continue to support the inclusion of korean common ancestral proto altaic language for the macro family has been tentatively reconstructed by sergei starostin and others micro altaic includes about living languages to which macro altaic would add korean jeju japanese and the ryukyuan languages for total of depending on what is considered language and what is considered dialect these numbers do not include earlier states of languages such as middle mongol old korean or old japanese earliest attestations of the languages the earliest known texts in turkic language are the orkhon inscriptions ad they were deciphered in by the danish linguist vilhelm thomsen in scholarly race with his rival the german russian linguist wilhelm radloff however radloff was the first to publish the inscriptions the first tungusic language to be attested is jurchen the language of the ancestors of the manchus writing system for it was devised in ad and an inscription using this system is known from see list of jurchen inscriptions the earliest mongolic language of which we have written evidence is known as middle mongol it is first attested by an inscription dated to or ad the stele of yisüngge and by the secret history of the mongols written in see mongolic languages the earliest para mongolic text is the memorial for yelü yanning written in the khitan large script and dated to ad however the inscription of hüis tolgoi discovered in and analysed as being in an early form of mongolic has been dated to ad the bugut inscription dates back to ad japanese is first attested in the form of names contained in few short inscriptions in classical chinese from the th century ad such as found on the inariyama sword the first substantial text in japanese however is the kojiki which dates from ad it is followed by the nihon shoki completed in and then by the man yōshū which dates from but includes material that is from about years earlier the most important text for the study of early korean is the hyangga collection of poems of which some go back to the three kingdoms period bc ad but are preserved in an orthography that only goes back to the th century ad korean is copiously attested from the mid th century on in the phonetically precise hangul system of writing history of the altaic family concept the altai mountains in east central asia give their name to the proposed language family origins proposed grouping of the turkic mongolic and tungusic languages was published in by philip johan von strahlenberg swedish officer who traveled in the eastern russian empire while prisoner of war after the great northern war however he may not have intended to imply closer relationship among those languages uralo altaic hypothesis in the finnish philologist matthias castrén proposed broader grouping that later came to be called the ural altaic family which included turkic mongolian and manchu tungus tungusic as an altaic branch and also the finno ugric and samoyedic languages as the uralic branch though castrén himself used the terms tataric and chudic the name altaic referred to the altai mountains in east central asia which are approximately the center of the geographic range of the three main families the name uralic referred to the ural mountains while the ural altaic family hypothesis can still be found in some encyclopedias atlases and similar general references after the it has been heavily criticized even linguists who accept the basic altaic family like sergei starostin completely discard the inclusion of the uralic branch korean and japanese languages in the austrian scholar anton boller suggested adding japanese to the ural altaic family in the ramstedt and polivanov advocated the inclusion of korean decades later in his book ramstedt rejected the ural altaic hypothesis but again included korean in altaic an inclusion followed by most leading altaicists supporters of the theory to date his book contained the first comprehensive attempt to identify regular correspondences among the sound systems within the altaic language families in nicholas poppe published what was in effect heavily revised version of ramstedt volume on phonology that has since set the standard in altaic studies poppe considered the issue of the relationship of korean to turkic mongolic tungusic not settled in his view there were three possibilities korean did not belong with the other three genealogically but had been influenced by an altaic substratum korean was related to the other three at the same level they were related to each other korean had split off from the other three before they underwent series of characteristic changes roy andrew miller book japanese and the other altaic languages convinced most altaicists that japanese also belonged to altaic since then the macro altaic has
