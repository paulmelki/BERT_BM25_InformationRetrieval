alaric ruler of all or ad was the first king of the visigoths from to he rose to leadership of the goths who came to occupy moesia territory acquired couple of decades earlier by combined force of goths and alans after the battle of adrianople alaric began his career under the gothic soldier gainas and later joined the roman army once an ally of rome under the emperor theodosius alaric helped defeat the franks and other allies of roman usurper despite losing many thousands of his men he received little recognition from rome for his efforts and left the roman army disappointed after the death of theodosius and the disintegration of the roman armies in he is described as king of the visigoths as the leader of the only effective field force remaining in the balkans he sought roman legitimacy never quite achieving position acceptable to himself and to the roman authorities he operated mainly against the successive western roman regimes and marched into italy where he died he is responsible for the sack of rome in one of several notable events in the western roman empire eventual decline early life federate status in the balkans imaginary portrait of alaric in strahlheim das welttheater band frankfurt according to jordanes th century roman bureaucrat of gothic origin who later turned his hand to history alaric was born on peuce island at the mouth of the danube delta in present day romania and belonged to the noble balti dynasty of the tervingian goths there is no way to verify this claim historian douglas boin does not make such an unequivocal assessment about alaric gothic heritage and instead claims he came from either the tervingi or the greuthung tribes when the goths suffered setbacks against the huns they made mass migration across the danube and fought war with rome alaric was probably child during this period who grew up along rome periphery alaric upbringing was shaped by living along the border of roman territory in region that the romans viewed as veritable backwater some four centuries before the roman poet ovid regarded the area along the danube and black sea where alaric was reared as land of barbarians among the most remote in the vast world alaric childhood in the balkans where the goths had settled by way of an agreement with theodosius was spent in the company of veterans who had fought at the battle of adrianople in during which they had annihilated much of the eastern army and killed emperor valens imperial campaigns against the visigoths were conducted until treaty was reached in this treaty was the first foedus on imperial roman soil and required these semi autonomous germanic tribes among whom alaric was raised to supply troops for the roman army in exchange for peace control of cultivatable land and freedom from roman direct administrative control correspondingly there was hardly region along the roman frontier during alaric day without gothic slaves and servants of one form or another for several subsequent decades many goths like alaric were called up into regular units of the eastern field army while others served as auxiliaries in campaigns led by theodosius against the western usurpers magnus maximus and eugenius rebellion against rome rise to gothic leadership new phase in the relationship between the goths and the empire resulted from the treaty signed in as more and more goths attained aristocratic rank from their service in the imperial army alaric began his military career under the gothic soldier gainas and later joined the roman army he first appeared as leader of mixed band of goths and allied peoples who invaded thrace in but were stopped by the half vandal roman general stilicho while the roman poet claudian belittled alaric as little known menace terrorizing southern thrace during this time alaric abilities and forces were formidable enough to prevent the roman emperor theodosius from crossing the maritsa river service under theodosius by alaric had entered roman military service which coincided with reduction of hostilities between goths and romans in he led gothic force that helped emperor theodosius defeat the frankish usurper arbogast fighting at the behest of eugenius at the battle of frigidus despite sacrificing around of his men who had been victims of theodosius callous tactical decision to overwhelm the enemies front lines using gothic foederati alaric received little recognition from the emperor alaric was among the few who survived the protracted and bloody affair many romans considered it their gain and victory that so many goths had died during the battle of frigidus river recent biographer douglas boin posits that seeing ten thousand of his alaric dead kinsmen likely elicited questions about what kind of ruler theodosius actually had been and whether remaining in direct roman service was best for men like him refused the reward he expected which included promotion to the position of magister militum and command of regular roman units alaric mutinied and began to march against constantinople on january theodosius died of an illness leaving his two young and incapable sons arcadius and honorius in stilicho guardianship modern writers regard alaric as king of the visigoths from according to historian peter heather it is not entirely clear in the sources if alaric rose to prominence at the time the goths revolted following theodosius death or if he had already risen within his tribe as early as the war against eugenius whatever the circumstances jordanes recorded that the new king persuaded his people to seek kingdom by their own exertions rather than serve others in idleness semi independent action in eastern roman interests eastern roman recognition whether or not alaric was member of an ancient germanic royal clan as claimed by jordanes and debated by historians is less important than his emergence as leader the first of his kind since fritigern theodosius death left the roman field armies collapsing and the empire divided again between his two sons one taking the eastern and the other the western portion of the empire
