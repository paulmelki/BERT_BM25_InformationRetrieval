apollo was march human spaceflight the third in nasa apollo program flown in low earth orbit it was the second crewed apollo mission that the united states launched via saturn rocket and was the first flight of the full apollo spacecraft the command and service module csm with the lunar module lm the mission was flown to qualify the lm for lunar orbit operations in preparation for the first moon landing by demonstrating its descent and ascent propulsion systems showing that its crew could fly it independently then rendezvous and dock with the csm again as would be required for the first crewed lunar landing other objectives of the flight included firing the lm descent engine to propel the spacecraft stack as backup mode as would be required on the apollo mission and use of the portable life support system backpack outside the lm cabin the three man crew consisted of commander james mcdivitt command module pilot david scott and lunar module pilot rusty schweickart during the ten day mission they tested systems and procedures critical to landing on the moon including the lm engines backpack life support systems navigation systems and docking maneuvers after launching on march the crew performed the first crewed flight of lunar module the first docking and extraction of the same one two person spacewalk eva and the second docking of two crewed spacecraft two months after the soviets performed spacewalk crew transfer between and the mission concluded on march and was complete success it proved the lm worthy of crewed spaceflight setting the stage for the dress rehearsal for the lunar landing apollo before the ultimate goal landing on the moon mission background in april mcdivitt scott and schweickart were selected by director of flight crew operations deke slayton as the second apollo crew their initial job was as backup to the first apollo crew to be chosen gus grissom ed white and roger chaffee for the first crewed earth orbital test flight of the block command and service module designated as delays in the block csm development pushed as into the revised plan had the mcdivitt crew scheduled for the second crewed csm which was to rendezvous in earth orbit with an uncrewed lm launched separately the third crewed mission to be commanded by frank borman was to be the first launch of saturnv with crew apollo spacecraft configuration with csm right and lm docked on january grissom crew was conducting launch pad test for their planned february mission which they named apollo when fire broke out in the cabin killing all three men complete safety review of the apollo program followed during this time apollo took place an uncrewed launch to test the first lunar module lm under the new schedule the first apollo crewed mission to go into space would be apollo planned for october this mission which was to test the block ii command module did not include lunar module in nasa had adopted series of lettered missions leading up to the crewed lunar landing the mission completion of one being prerequisite to the next apollo would be the cmission but the dmission required testing of the crewed lunar module which was running well behind schedule and endangering john kennedy goal of americans walking on the moon and returning safely to earth by the end of the mcdivitt crew had been announced by nasa in november as prime crew for the dmission lengthy testing of the command and lunar modules in earth orbit seeking to keep kennedy goal on schedule in august apollo program manager george low proposed that if apollo in october went well apollo would go to lunar orbit without lm until then apollo was the dmission with apollo the mission testing in medium earth orbit after nasa approved sending apollo to the moon while making apollo the dmission slayton offered mcdivitt the opportunity to stay with apollo and thus go to lunar orbit mcdivitt turned it down on behalf of his crew preferring to stay with the dmission now apollo apollo went well and the crews were switched the crew swap also affected who would be the first astronauts to land on the moon for when the crews for apollo and were swapped so were the backup crews since the rule of thumb was for backup crews to fly as prime crew three missions later this put neil armstrong crew borman backup in position to make the first landing attempt on apollo instead of pete conrad crew who made the second landing on apollo framework crew and key mission control personnel mcdivitt was in the air force selected as member of the second group of astronauts in he was command pilot of gemini scott also air force was selected in the third astronaut group in and flew alongside neil armstrong in gemini on which the first spacecraft docking was performed schweickart civilian who had served in the air force and massachusetts air national guard was selected as group astronaut but was not assigned to gemini mission and had no spaceflight experience the backup crew consisted of pete conrad as commander command module pilot richard gordon jr and lunar module pilot alan bean this crew flew as prime on apollo in november the support crew for apollo consisted of stuart roosa jack lousma edgar mitchell and alfred worden lousma was not an original member of the apollo support crew but was assigned after fred haise jr was moved to the position of backup lunar module pilot on apollo several astronauts were shifted in the wake of michael collins being removed from the apollo prime crew because of treatment for bone spurs the flight directors were gene kranz first shift gerry griffin second shift and pete frank third shift capsule communicators were conrad gordon bean worden roosa and ronald evans as of all three apollo astronauts remain alive mission
