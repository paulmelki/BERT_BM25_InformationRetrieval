the time kraepelin was doing clinical research on psychosis in senile patients alzheimer on the other hand was more interested in the lab work of senile illnesses the two men would face many challenges involving the politics of the psychiatric community for example both formal and informal arrangements would be made among psychiatrists at asylums and universities to receive cadavers in

records and brain upon her death on april frau deter died and alzheimer had her medical records and brain brought to munich where he was working in kraepelin laboratory with two italian physicians he used the staining techniques of bielschowsky to identify amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles these brain anomalies would become identifiers of what later became known as alzheimer disease
