motor neuron diseases or motor neurone diseases mnds are group of rare disorders that selectively affect motor neurons the cells which control voluntary muscles of the body they include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als progressive bulbar palsy pbp pseudobulbar palsy progressive muscular atrophy pma primary lateral sclerosis pls and monomelic amyotrophy mma as well as some rarer variants resembling als motor neuron diseases affect both children and adults while each motor neuron disease affects patients differently they all cause movement related symptoms mainly muscle weakness most of these diseases seem to occur randomly without known causes but some forms are inherited studies into these inherited forms have led to discoveries of various genes sod that are thought to be important in understanding how the disease occurs symptoms of motor neuron diseases can be first seen at birth or can come on slowly later in life most of these diseases worsen over time while some such as als shorten one life expectancy others do not currently there are no approved treatments for the majority of motor neuron disorders and care is mostly symptomatic signs and symptoms man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als he needs assistance to stand advanced atrophy of the tongue there is upper limb and truncal muscle atrophy with positive babinski sign advanced thenar muscle atrophy signs and symptoms depend on the specific disease but motor neuron diseases typically manifest as group of movement related symptoms they come on slowly and worsen over the course of more than three months various patterns of muscle weakness are seen and muscle cramps and spasms may occur one can have difficulty breathing with climbing stairs exertion difficulty breathing when lying down orthopnea or even respiratory failure if breathing muscles become involved bulbar symptoms including difficulty speaking dysarthria difficulty swallowing dysphagia and excessive saliva production sialorrhea can also occur sensation or the ability to feel is typically not affected emotional disturbance pseudobulbar affect and cognitive and behavioural changes problems in word fluency decision making and memory are also seen there can be lower motor neuron findings muscle wasting muscle twitching upper motor neuron findings brisk reflexes babinski reflex hoffman reflex increased muscle tone or both motor neuron diseases are seen both in children and in adults those that affect children tend to be inherited or familial and their symptoms are either present at birth or appear before learning to walk those that affect adults tend to appear after age the clinical course depends on the specific disease but most progress or worsen over the course of months some are fatal als while others are not pls patterns of weakness various patterns of muscle weakness occur in different motor neuron diseases weakness can be symmetric or asymmetric and it can occur in body parts that are distal proximal or both according to statland et al there are three main weakness patterns that are seen in motor neuron diseases which are asymmetric distal weakness without sensory loss als pls pma mma symmetric weakness without sensory loss pma pls symmetric focal midline proximal weakness neck trunk bulbar involvement als pbp pls lower and upper motor neuron findings motor neuron diseases are on spectrum in terms of upper and lower motor neuron involvement some have just lower or upper motor neuron findings while others have mix of both lower motor neuron lmn findings include muscle atrophy and fasciculations and upper motor neuron umn findings include hyperreflexia spasticity muscle spasm and abnormal reflexes pure upper motor neuron diseases or those with just umn findings include pls pure lower motor neuron diseases or those with just lmn findings include pma motor neuron diseases with both umn and lmn findings include both familial and sporadic als causes most cases are sporadic and their causes are usually not known it is thought that environmental toxic viral or genetic factors may be involved dna damage tardbp tar dna binding protein also referred to as tdp is critical component of the non homologous end joining nhej enzymatic pathway that repairs dna double strand breaks in pluripotent stem cell derived motor neurons tdp is rapidly recruited to double strand breaks where it acts as scaffold for the recruitment of the xrcc dna ligase protein complex that then acts to repair double strand breaks about of als patients have abnormalities in the nucleus cytoplasmic localization in spinal motor neurons of tdp in tdp depleted human neural stem cell derived motor neurons as well as in sporadic als patients spinal cord specimens there is significant double strand break accumulation and reduced levels of nhej associated risk factors in adults men are more commonly affected than women diagnosis differential diagnosis can be challenging due to the number of overlapping symptoms shared between several motor neuron diseases frequently the diagnosis is based on clinical findings lmn vs umn signs and symptoms patterns of weakness family history of mnd and variation of tests many of which are used to rule out disease mimics which can manifest with identical symptoms classification corticospinal tract upper motor neurons originating in the primary motor cortex synapse to either lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the central gray matter of the spinal cord insert or brainstem motor neurons not shown motor neuron disease can affect either upper motor neurons umns or lower motor neurons lmns motor neuron disease describes collection of clinical disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and the degeneration of the motor neuron on testing as discussed above the term motor neuron disease has varying meanings in different countries similarly the literature inconsistently classifies which degenerative motor neuron disorders can be included under the umbrella term motor neuron disease the four main types of mnd are marked in the table below all types of mnd can be differentiated by two defining characteristics is the disease sporadic or inherited is there involvement of the upper motor neurons umn the lower motor neurons lmn or both sporadic or acquired mnds occur in patients with no family history of degenerative motor neuron disease inherited
