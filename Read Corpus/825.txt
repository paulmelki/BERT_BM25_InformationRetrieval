aesthetics or esthetics is branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of beauty and taste as well as the philosophy of art its own area of philosophy that comes out of aesthetics it examines subjective and sensori emotional values or sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste aesthetics covers both natural and artificial sources of aesthetic experience and judgment it considers what happens in our minds when we engage with aesthetic objects or environments such as in viewing visual art listening to music reading poetry experiencing play exploring nature and so on the philosophy of art specifically studies how artists imagine create and perform works of art as well as how people use enjoy and criticize their art it deals with how one feels about art in general why they like some works of art and not others and how art can affect our moods or even our beliefs both aesthetics generally and philosophy of art especially ask questions like what is art what is work of art and what makes good art scholars in the field have defined aesthetics as critical reflection on art culture and nature in modern english the term aesthetic can also refer to set of principles underlying the works of particular art movement or theory one speaks for example of renaissance aesthetic etymology the word aesthetic is derived from the greek aisthetikos meaning aesthetic sensitive sentient pertaining to sense perception which in turn was derived from αἰσθάνομαι aisthanomai meaning perceive feel sense and related to aisthēsis sensation aesthetics in this central sense has been said to start with the series of articles on the pleasures of the imagination which the journalist joseph addison wrote in the early issues of the magazine the spectator in the term aesthetics was appropriated and coined with new meaning by the german philosopher alexander baumgarten in his dissertation meditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema pertinentibus philosophical considerations of some matters pertaining the poem in baumgarten chose aesthetics because he wished to emphasize the experience of art as means of knowing aesthetics not very tidy intellectual discipline is heterogeneous collection of problems that concern the arts primarily but also relate to nature even though his later definition in the fragment aesthetica is more often referred to as the first definition of modern aesthetics aesthetics and the philosophy of art some separate aesthetics and philosophy of art claiming that the former is the study of beauty and taste while the latter is the study of art proper in the form of materialized works of artists however most commonly aesthetics encompasses both questions around beauty as well as questions about art it examines topics such as aesthetic objects aesthetic experience and aesthetic judgments for some aesthetics is considered synonym for the philosophy of art since hegel while others insist that there is significant distinction between these closely related fields in practice aesthetic judgement refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object not necessarily an art object while artistic judgement refers to the recognition appreciation or criticism of art or an art work philosophical aesthetics not only has to speak about art and to produce judgments about art works but also has to give definition of what art is art is an autonomous entity for philosophy because art deals with the senses the etymology of aesthetics and art is as such free of any moral or political purpose hence there are two different conceptions of art in aesthetics art as knowledge or art as action but aesthetics is neither epistemology nor ethics aestheticians compare historical developments with theoretical approaches to the arts of many periods they study the varieties of art in relation to their physical social and culture environments aestheticians also use psychology to understand how people see hear imagine think learn and act in relation to the materials and problems of art aesthetic psychology studies the creative process and the aesthetic experience aesthetic judgment universals and ethics aesthetic judgment aesthetics examines affective domain response to an object or phenomenon judgments of aesthetic value rely on the ability to discriminate at sensory level however aesthetic judgments usually go beyond sensory discrimination for david hume delicacy of taste is not merely the ability to detect all the ingredients in composition but also the sensitivity to pains as well as pleasures which escape the rest of mankind thus the sensory discrimination is linked to capacity for pleasure for immanuel kant critique of judgment enjoyment is the result when pleasure arises from sensation but judging something to be beautiful has third requirement sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging reflective contemplation judgments of beauty are sensory emotional and intellectual all at once kant observed of man if he says that canary wine is agreeable he is quite content if someone else corrects his terms and reminds him to say instead it is agreeable to me because everyone has his own sense of taste the case of beauty is different from mere agreeableness because if he proclaims something to be beautiful then he requires the same liking from others he then judges not just for himself but for everyone and speaks of beauty as if it were property of things viewer interpretations of beauty may on occasion be observed to possess two concepts of value aesthetics and taste aesthetics is the philosophical notion of beauty taste is result of an education process and awareness of elite cultural values learned through exposure to mass culture bourdieu examined how the elite in society define the aesthetic values like taste and how varying levels of exposure to these values can result in variations by class cultural background and education according to kant beauty is subjective and universal thus certain things are beautiful to everyone in the opinion of władysław tatarkiewicz there are six conditions for the presentation of art beauty form representation
