an analgesic or painkiller is any member of the group of drugs used to achieve analgesia relief from pain analgesic drugs act in various ways on the peripheral and central nervous systems they are distinct from anesthetics which temporarily affect and in some instances completely eliminate sensation analgesics include paracetamol known in north america as acetaminophen or simply apap the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids such as the salicylates and opioid drugs such as morphine and oxycodone when choosing analgesics the severity and response to other medication determine the choice of agent the world health organization who pain ladder specifies mild analgesics as its first step analgesic choice is also determined by the type of pain for neuropathic pain traditional analgesics are less effective and there is often benefit from classes of drugs that are not normally considered analgesics such as tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants classification analgesics are typically classified based on their mechanism of action bottle of px paracetamol acetaminophen paracetamol also known as acetaminophen or apap is medication used to treat pain and fever it is typically used for mild to moderate pain in combination with opioid pain medication paracetamol is now used for more severe pain such as cancer pain and after surgery it is typically used either by mouth or rectally but is also available intravenously effects last between two and four hours paracetamol is classified as mild analgesic paracetamol is generally safe at recommended doses nsaids nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs usually abbreviated to nsaids are drug class that groups together drugs that decrease pain and lower fever and in higher doses decrease inflammation the most prominent members of this group of drugs aspirin ibuprofen and naproxen are all available over the counter in most countries cox inhibitors these drugs have been derived from nsaids the cyclooxygenase enzyme inhibited by nsaids was discovered to have at least different versions cox and cox research suggested most of the adverse effects of nsaids to be mediated by blocking the cox constitutive enzyme with the analgesic effects being mediated by the cox inducible enzyme thus the cox inhibitors were developed to inhibit only the cox enzyme traditional nsaids block both versions in general these drugs such as rofecoxib celecoxib and etoricoxib are equally effective analgesics when compared with nsaids but cause less hemorrhage in particular after widespread adoption of the cox inhibitors it was discovered that most of the drugs in this class increase the risk of cardiovascular events by on average this led to the withdrawal of rofecoxib and valdecoxib and warnings on others etoricoxib seems relatively safe with the risk of thrombotic events similar to that of non coxib nsaid diclofenac opioids morphine the archetypal opioid and other opioids codeine oxycodone hydrocodone dihydromorphine pethidine all exert similar influence on the cerebral opioid receptor system buprenorphine is partial agonist of the opioid receptor and tramadol is serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor snri with weak opioid receptor agonist properties tramadol is structurally closer to venlafaxine than to codeine and delivers analgesia by not only delivering opioid like effects through mild agonism of the mu receptor but also by acting as weak but fast acting serotonin releasing agent and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor tapentadol with some structural similarities to tramadol presents what is believed to be novel drug working through two and possibly three different modes of action in the fashion of both traditional opioid and as an snri the effects of serotonin and norepinephrine on pain while not completely understood have had causal links established and drugs in the snri class are commonly used in conjunction with opioids especially tapentadol and tramadol with greater success in pain relief dosing of all opioids may be limited by opioid toxicity confusion respiratory depression myoclonic jerks and pinpoint pupils seizures tramadol but opioid tolerant individuals usually have higher dose ceilings than patients without tolerance opioids while very effective analgesics may have some unpleasant side effects patients starting morphine may experience nausea and vomiting generally relieved by short course of antiemetics such as phenergan pruritus itching may require switching to different opioid constipation occurs in almost all patients on opioids and laxatives lactulose macrogol containing or co danthramer are typically co prescribed when used appropriately opioids and other central analgesics are safe and effective however risks such as addiction and the body becoming used to the drug tolerance can occur the effect of tolerance means that frequent use of the drug may result in its diminished effect when safe to do so the dosage may need to be increased to maintain effectiveness against tolerance which may be of particular concern regarding patients suffering with chronic pain and requiring an analgesic over long periods opioid tolerance is often addressed with opioid rotation therapy in which patient is routinely switched between two or more non cross tolerant opioid medications in order to prevent exceeding safe dosages in the attempt to achieve an adequate analgesic effect opioid tolerance should not be confused with opioid induced hyperalgesia the symptoms of these two conditions can appear very similar but the mechanism of action is different opioid induced hyperalgesia is when exposure to opioids increases the sensation of pain hyperalgesia and can even make non painful stimuli painful allodynia alcohol alcohol has biological mental and social effects which influence the consequences of using alcohol for pain moderate use of alcohol can lessen certain types of pain in certain circumstances the majority of its analgesic effects come from antagonizing nmda receptors similarly to ketamine thus decreasing the activity of the primary excitatory signal boosting glutamate it also functions as an analgesic to lesser degree by increasing the activity of the primary inhibitory signal reducing gaba attempting to use alcohol to treat pain has also been observed to lead to negative outcomes including excessive drinking and alcohol use disorder cannabis medical cannabis or medical marijuana refers to cannabis or its cannabinoids used to treat disease or improve symptoms there is evidence suggesting that cannabis can be used to treat chronic pain and muscle
