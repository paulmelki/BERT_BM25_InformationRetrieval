arsenic is chemical element with the symbol as and atomic number arsenic occurs in many minerals usually in combination with sulfur and metals but also as pure elemental crystal arsenic is metalloid it has various allotropes but only the gray form which has metallic appearance is important to industry the primary use of arsenic is in alloys of lead for example in car batteries and ammunition arsenic is common type dopant in semiconductor electronic devices it is also component of the iii compound semiconductor gallium arsenide arsenic and its compounds especially the trioxide are used in the production of pesticides treated wood products herbicides and insecticides these applications are declining with the increasing recognition of the toxicity of arsenic and its compounds few species of bacteria are able to use arsenic compounds as respiratory metabolites trace quantities of arsenic are an essential dietary element in rats hamsters goats chickens and presumably other species role in human metabolism is not known however arsenic poisoning occurs in multicellular life if quantities are larger than needed arsenic contamination of groundwater is problem that affects millions of people across the world the united states environmental protection agency states that all forms of arsenic are serious risk to human health the united states agency for toxic substances and disease registry ranked arsenic as number in its priority list of hazardous substances at superfund sites arsenic is classified as group carcinogen characteristics physical characteristics sb assb and gray as the three most common arsenic allotropes are gray yellow and black arsenic with gray being the most common gray arsenic as space group rm no adopts double layered structure consisting of many interlocked ruffled six membered rings because of weak bonding between the layers gray arsenic is brittle and has relatively low mohs hardness of nearest and next nearest neighbors form distorted octahedral complex with the three atoms in the same double layer being slightly closer than the three atoms in the next this relatively close packing leads to high density of cm gray arsenic is semimetal but becomes semiconductor with bandgap of ev if amorphized gray arsenic is also the most stable form yellow arsenic is soft and waxy and somewhat similar to tetraphosphorus both have four atoms arranged in tetrahedral structure in which each atom is bound to each of the other three atoms by single bond this unstable allotrope being molecular is the most volatile least dense and most toxic solid yellow arsenic is produced by rapid cooling of arsenic vapor it is rapidly transformed into gray arsenic by light the yellow form has density of cm black arsenic is similar in structure to black phosphorus black arsenic can also be formed by cooling vapor at around and by crystallization of amorphous arsenic in the presence of mercury vapors it is glassy and brittle it is also poor electrical conductor isotopes arsenic occurs in nature as monoisotopic element composed of one stable isotope as as of at least radioisotopes have also been synthesized ranging in atomic mass from to the most stable of these is as with half life of days all other isotopes have half lives of under one day with the exception of as hours as hours as days as days and as hours isotopes that are lighter than the stable as tend to decay by decay and those that are heavier tend to decay by decay with some exceptions at least nuclear isomers have been described ranging in atomic mass from to the most stable of arsenic isomers is mas with half life of seconds chemistry arsenic has similar and ionization energies to its lighter congener phosphorus and accordingly readily forms covalent molecules with most of the nonmetals though stable in dry air arsenic forms golden bronze tarnish upon exposure to humidity which eventually becomes black surface layer when heated in air arsenic oxidizes to arsenic trioxide the fumes from this reaction have an odor resembling garlic this odor can be detected on striking arsenide minerals such as arsenopyrite with hammer it burns in oxygen to form arsenic trioxide and arsenic pentoxide which have the same structure as the more well known phosphorus compounds and in fluorine to give arsenic pentafluoride arsenic and some arsenic compounds sublimes upon heating at atmospheric pressure converting directly to gaseous form without an intervening liquid state at the triple point is mpa and arsenic makes arsenic acid with concentrated nitric acid arsenous acid with dilute nitric acid and arsenic trioxide with concentrated sulfuric acid however it does not react with water alkalis or non oxidising acids arsenic reacts with metals to form arsenides though these are not ionic compounds containing the as ion as the formation of such an anion would be highly endothermic and even the group arsenides have properties of intermetallic compounds like germanium selenium and bromine which like arsenic succeed the transition series arsenic is much less stable in the group oxidation state of than its vertical neighbors phosphorus and antimony and hence arsenic pentoxide and arsenic acid are potent oxidizers compounds compounds of arsenic resemble in some respects those of phosphorus which occupies the same group column of the periodic table the most common oxidation states for arsenic are in the arsenides which are alloy like intermetallic compounds in the arsenites and in the arsenates and most organoarsenic compounds arsenic also bonds readily to itself as seen in the square as ions in the mineral skutterudite in the oxidation state arsenic is typically pyramidal owing to the influence of the lone pair of electrons inorganic compounds one of the simplest arsenic compound is the trihydride the highly toxic flammable pyrophoric arsine ash this compound is generally regarded as stable since at room temperature it decomposes only slowly at temperatures of decomposition to arsenic and hydrogen is rapid several factors such as humidity presence of light and certain catalysts namely aluminium facilitate the rate of decomposition it oxidises readily in air to form arsenic trioxide and water and analogous reactions take place
