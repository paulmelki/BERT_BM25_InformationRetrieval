and chloroform associated with an insoluble bituminous substance amber is macromolecule by free radical polymerization of several precursors in the labdane family communic acid cummunol and biformene these labdanes are diterpenes and trienes equipping the organic skeleton with three alkene groups for polymerization as amber matures over the years more polymerization takes place as well as isomerization reactions crosslinking and cyclization heated above
