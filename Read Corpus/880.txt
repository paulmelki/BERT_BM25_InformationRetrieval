ælle also aelle or ella is recorded in early sources as the first king of the south saxons reigning in what is now called sussex england from to perhaps as late as according to the anglo saxon chronicle ælle and three of his sons are said to have landed at place called cymensora and fought against the local britons the chronicle goes on to report victory in at present day pevensey where the battle ended with the saxons slaughtering their opponents to the last man ælle was the first king recorded by the th century chronicler bede to have held imperium or overlordship over other anglo saxon kingdoms in the late th century anglo saxon chronicle around four hundred years after his time ælle is recorded as being the first bretwalda or britain ruler though there is no evidence that this was contemporary title ælle death is not recorded and although he may have been the founder of south saxon dynasty there is no firm evidence linking him with later south saxon rulers the th century chronicler henry of huntingdon produced an enhanced version of the anglo saxon chronicle that included as the date of ælle death but this is not secure historical context imaginary depiction of ælle from john speed saxon heptarchy historians are divided on the detail of ælle life and existence as it was during the least documented period in english history of the last two millennia by the early th century britain had been roman for over three hundred and fifty years amongst the enemies of roman britain were the picts of central and northern scotland and the gaels known as scoti who were raiders from ireland also vexatious were the saxons the name roman writers gave to the peoples who lived in the northern part of what is now germany and the southern part of the jutland peninsula saxon raids on the southern and eastern shores of england had been sufficiently alarming by the late rd century for the romans to build the saxon shore forts and subsequently to establish the role of the count of the saxon shore to command the defence against these incursions roman control of britain finally ended in the early part of the th century the date usually given as marking the end of roman britain is when the emperor honorius sent letters to the british urging them to look to their own defence britain had been repeatedly stripped of troops to support usurpers claims to the roman empire and after the roman armies never returned sources for events after this date are extremely scarce but tradition reported as early as the mid th century by british priest named gildas records that the british sent for help against the barbarians to aetius roman consul probably in the late no help came subsequently british leader named vortigern is supposed to have invited continental mercenaries to help fight the picts who were attacking from the north the leaders whose names are recorded as hengest and horsa rebelled and long period of warfare ensued the invaders angles saxons jutes and frisians gained control of parts of england but lost major battle at mons badonicus the location of which is not known some authors have speculated that ælle may have led the saxon forces at this battle while others reject the idea out of hand the british thus gained respite and peace lasted at least until the time gildas was writing that is for perhaps forty or fifty years from around the end of the th century until midway through the sixth shortly after gildas time the anglo saxon advance was resumed and by the late th century nearly all of southern england was under the control of the continental invaders early sources image parker chronicle gif thumb px right page from the manuscript of the anglo saxon chronicle ælle name spelled elle can be seen in two of the entries at the end of the page the last entry on the page for refers to events in kent and does not mention ælle there are two early sources that mention ælle by name the earliest is the ecclesiastical history of the english people history of the english church written in by bede northumbrian monk bede mentions ælle as one of the anglo saxon kings who exercised what he calls imperium over all the provinces south of the river humber imperium is usually translated as overlordship bede gives list of seven kings who held imperium and ælle is the first of them the other information bede gives is that ælle was not christian bede mentions later king as the first to enter the kingdom of heaven the second source is the anglo saxon chronicle collection of annals assembled in the kingdom of wessex in during the reign of alfred the great the chronicle has three entries for ælle from to as follows ælle and his sons cymen and wlencing and cissa came to the land of britain with ships at the place which is named cymen shore and there killed many welsh and drove some to flight into the wood called andredes leag here ælle fought against the welsh near the margin of mearcred burn here ælle and cissa besieged andredes cester and killed all who lived in there there was not even one briton left there the chronicle was put together about four hundred years after these events it is known that the annalists used material from earlier chronicles as well as from oral sources such as sagas but there is no way to tell where these lines came from the terms british and welsh were used interchangeably as welsh is the saxon word meaning foreigner and was applied to all the native romano british of the era three of the places named may be identified cymen shore cymenes ora in the original is believed to be located at what is now series of rocks and ledges in the english channel off selsey
