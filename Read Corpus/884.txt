fingerpicking steel string guitar martin eric clapton model fender dg sce epiphone pr vs the steel string acoustic guitar is modern form of guitar that descends from the nylon strung classical guitar but is strung with steel strings for brighter louder sound like the classical guitar it is often referred to simply as an acoustic guitar the most common type is often called flat top guitar to distinguish it from the more specialized archtop guitar and other variations the standard tuning for an acoustic guitar is low to high although many players particularly fingerpickers use alternate tunings scordatura such as open open drop or particularly in irish traditional music construction steel string guitars vary in construction and materials different woods and approach to bracing affect the instrument timbre or tone while there is little scientific evidence many players and luthiers believe well made guitar tone improves over time they theorize that decrease in the content of hemicellulose crystallization of cellulose and changes to lignin over time all result in its wood gaining better resonating properties types steel string acoustic guitars are commonly constructed in several body types varying in size depth and proportion in general the guitar soundbox can be thought of as composed of two mating chambers the upper bouts bout being the rounded corner of an instrument body on the neck end of the body and lower bouts on the bridge end these meet at the waist or the narrowest part of the body face near the soundhole the proportion and overall size of these two parts helps determine the overall tonal balance and native sound of particular body style the larger the body the louder the volume the double or grand concert body type is the major body style most directly derived from the classical guitar it has the thinnest soundbox and the smallest overall size making it very comfortable to play but lacking in projection volume relative to the larger types its smaller size makes it suitable for younger or smaller framed players it is commonly called parlor steel as it is well suited to smaller rooms martin xxx series and taylor series are common examples the grand auditorium guitar sometimes called the or the triple is very similar in design to the grand concert but slightly wider and deeper many style guitars also have convex back to increase the physical volume of the soundbox without making it deeper at the edges which would affect comfort and playability the result is very balanced tone comparable to the but with greater volume and dynamic range and slightly more low end response making this classically shaped body style very popular eric clapton signature martin for example is of this style martin xxx series and taylor series are well known examples of the grand auditorium style the dreadnought is large bodied guitar which incorporates deeper soundbox but smaller and less pronounced upper bout than most styles its size and power gave rise to its name from the most formidable class of warship at the time of its creation in the early th century the style was designed by martin guitars to produce deeper sound than classic style guitars with very resonant bass its body combination of compact profile with deep sound has since been copied by virtually every major steel string luthier making it the most popular body type martin series guitars such as the highly prized are classic examples of the dreadnought the jumbo body type is bigger again than grand auditorium but similarly proportioned and is generally designed to provide deep tone similar to dreadnought it was designed by gibson to compete with the dreadnought but with maximum resonant space for greater volume and sustain these come at the expense of being oversized with very deep sounding box and thus somewhat more difficult to play the foremost example of the style is the gibson but like the dreadnought most guitar manufacturers have at least one jumbo model any of these body type can incorporate cutaway where section of the upper bout below the neck is scalloped out this allows for easier access to the frets located atop the soundbox at the expense of reduced soundbox volume and altered bracing which can affect the resonant qualities and resulting tone of the instrument all of these relatively traditional looking and constructed instruments are commonly referred to as flattop guitars all are commonly used in popular music genres including rock blues country and folk other styles of guitar which enjoy moderate popularity generally in more specific genres include the archtop which incorporates an arched violin like top either carved out of solid wood or heat pressed using laminations it usually has violin style holes rather than single round sound hole it is most commonly used by swing and jazz players and often incorporates an electric pickup the selmer maccaferri guitar is usually played by those who follow the style of django reinhardt it is an unusual looking instrument distinguished by fairly large body with squarish bouts and either shaped or longitudinal oval soundhole the strings are gathered at the tail like an archtop guitar but the top is flatter it also has wide fingerboard and slotted head like nylon string guitar the loud volume and penetrating tone make it suitable for single note soloing and it is frequently employed as lead instrument in gypsy swing the resonator guitar also called the dobro after its most prominent manufacturer amplifies its sound through one or more metal cone shaped resonators it was designed to overcome the problem of conventional acoustic guitars being overwhelmed by horns and percussion instruments in dance orchestras it became prized for its distinctive sound however and gained place in several musical styles most notably blues and bluegrass and retains niche well after the proliferation of electric amplification the string guitar replaces each string with course of two strings the lower pairs are tuned an octave apart its unique sound was made famous by artists such as lead belly
