simplified procedure to determine whether two sounds represent the same or different phonemes the cases on the extreme left and the extreme right are those in which the sounds are allophones in phonology an allophone from the greek állos other and phōnē voice sound is one of set of multiple possible spoken sounds or phones or signs used to pronounce single phoneme in particular language for example in english as in stop and the aspirated form as in top are allophones for the phoneme while these two are considered to be different phonemes in some languages such as thai and hindi on the other hand in spanish as in dolor and as in nada are allophones for the phoneme while these two are considered to be different phonemes in english the specific allophone selected in given situation is often predictable from the phonetic context with such allophones being called positional variants but some allophones occur in free variation replacing sound by another allophone of the same phoneme usually does not change the meaning of word but the result may sound non native or even unintelligible native speakers of given language perceive one phoneme in the language as single distinctive sound and are both unaware of and even shocked by the allophone variations that are used to pronounce single phonemes history of concept the term allophone was coined by benjamin lee whorf circa in doing so he placed cornerstone in consolidating early phoneme theory the term was popularized by george trager and bernard bloch in paper on english phonology and went on to become part of standard usage within the american structuralist tradition complementary and free variant allophones and assimilation whenever user speech is vocalized for given phoneme it is slightly different from other utterances even for the same speaker that has led to some debate over how real and how universal phonemes really are see phoneme for details only some of the variation is significant by being detectable or perceivable to speakers there are two types of allophones based on whether phoneme must be pronounced using specific allophone in specific situation or whether the speaker has the unconscious freedom to choose the allophone that is used if specific allophone from set of allophones that correspond to phoneme must be selected in given context and using different allophone for phoneme would cause confusion or make the speaker sound non native the allophones are said to be complementary the allophones then complement each other and one of them is not used in situation in which the usage of another is standard for complementary allophones each allophone is used in specific phonetic context and may be involved in phonological process in other cases the speaker can freely select from free variant allophones on personal habit or preference but free variant allophones are still selected in the specific context not the other way around another example of an allophone is assimilation in which phoneme is to sound more like another phoneme one example of assimilation is consonant voicing and devoicing in which voiceless consonants are voiced before and after voiced consonants and voiced consonants are devoiced before and after voiceless consonants allotone an allotone is tonic allophone such as the neutral tone in standard mandarin examples english there are many allophonic processes in english lack of plosion nasal plosion partial devoicing of sonorants complete devoicing of sonorants partial devoicing of obstruents lengthening and shortening vowels and retraction aspiration in english voiceless plosive is aspirated has strong explosion of breath if it is at the beginning of the first or stressed syllable in word for example as in pin and as in spin are allophones for the phoneme because they cannot distinguish words in fact they occur in complementary distribution english speakers treat them as the same sound but they are different the first is aspirated and the second is unaspirated plain many languages treat the two phones differently nasal plosion in english plosive has nasal plosion if it is followed by nasal whether within word or across word boundary partial devoicing of sonorants in english sonorants are partially devoiced after voiceless sound in the same syllable complete devoicing of sonorants in english sonorant is completely devoiced after an aspirated plosive partial devoicing of obstruents in english voiced obstruent is partially devoiced next to pause or next to voiceless sound within word or across word boundary retraction in english are retracted before because the choice among allophones is seldom under conscious control few people realize their existence english speakers may be unaware of the differences among six allophones of the phoneme unreleased as in cat aspirated as in top glottalized as in button flapped as in american english water nasalized flapped as in winter and none of the above as in stop however they may become aware of the differences if for example they contrast the pronunciations of the following words night rate unreleased without word space between and nitrate aspirated or retracted flame that is held before the lips while those words are spoken flickers more for the aspirated nitrate than for the unaspirated night rate the difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips for mandarin speaker for whom and are separate phonemes the english distinction is much more obvious than for an english speaker who has learned since childhood to ignore the distinction allophones of english may be noticed if the light of leaf is contrasted with the dark of feel again the difference is much more obvious to turkish speaker for whom and are separate phonemes than to an english speaker for whom they are allophones of single phoneme these descriptions are more sequentially broken down in the next section rules for english consonant allophones peter ladefoged renowned phonetician clearly explains the consonant allophones of english in precise list of statements to illustrate the language behavior some of these rules apply to all the consonants of english the first item on the list deals with
