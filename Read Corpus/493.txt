ring depicting alaric ii museum vienna alaric ii ruler of all also known as alaricus in latin august was the king of the visigoths in he succeeded his father euric as king of the visigoths in toulouse on december he was the great grandson of the more famous alaric who sacked rome in he established his capital at aire sur adour vicus julii in aquitaine his dominions included not only the majority of hispania excluding its northwestern corner but also gallia aquitania and the greater part of an as yet undivided gallia narbonensis reign herwig wolfram opens his chapter on the eighth visigothic king alaric reign gets no full treatment in the sources and the little they do contain is overshadowed by his death in the battle of vouillé and the downfall of the toulosan kingdom one example is isidore of seville account of alaric reign consisting of single paragraph it is primarily about alaric death in that battle imaginary portrait of alaric ii by carlos esquivel rivas oil on canvas the earliest documented event in alaric reign concerned providing refuge to syagrius the former ruler of the domain of soissons in what is now northwestern france who had been defeated by clovis king of the franks according to gregory of tours account alaric was intimidated by clovis into surrendering syagrius to clovis gregory then adds that the goths are timorous race the franks then imprisoned syagrius and once his control over syagrius former kingdom was secure clovis had him beheaded however wolfram points out that at the time clovis got no farther than the seine only after several more years did the franks succeed in occupying the rest of the gallo roman buffer state north of the loire any threat of war clovis could make would only be effective if they were neighbors it is nowhere written that syagrius was handed over in or despite frankish advances in the years that followed alaric was not afraid to take the military initiative when it presented itself in alaric assisted his fellow gothic king theodoric the great in his conquest of italy by dispatching an army to raise odoacer siege of pavia where theodoric had been trapped then when the franks attacked the burgundians in the decade after alaric assisted the ruling house and according to wolfram the victorious burgundian king gundobad ceded avignon to alaric by clovis and alaric met on an island in the loire near amboise for face to face talks which led to peace treaty in the visigoths captured the city of dertosa in the ebro valley there they captured the roman usurper peter and had him executed battle of vouillé and aftermath the kingdom of the visigoths under alaric ii after few years however clovis violated the peace treaty negotiated in despite the diplomatic intervention of theodoric king of the ostrogoths and father in law of alaric clovis led his followers into visigothic territory alaric was forced by his magnates to meet clovis in the battle of vouillé summer near poitiers there the goths were defeated and alaric slain according to gregory of tours by clovis himself the most serious consequence of this battle was not the loss of their possessions in gaul to the franks with ostrogothic help much of the gallic territory was recovered herwig wolfram notes perhaps as far as toulouse nor was it the loss of the royal treasury at toulouse which gregory of tours writes clovis took into his possession as peter heather notes the visigothic kingdom was thrown into disarray by the death of its king in battle alaric heirs were his eldest son the illegitimate gesalec and his younger son the legitimate amalaric who was still child gesalec proved incompetent and in king theodoric assumed the throne of the kingdom ostensibly on behalf of amalaric heather uses the word hijacked to describe his action although amalaric eventually became king in his own right the political continuity of the visigothic kingdom was broken amalaric succession was the result of new power structures not old ones as heather describes it with amalaric death in the visigothic kingdom entered an extended period of unrest which lasted until leovigild assumed the throne in ability as king in religion alaric was an arian like all the early visigothic nobles but he greatly mitigated the persecution policy of his father euric toward the catholics and authorized them to hold in the council of agde he was on uneasy terms with the catholic bishops of arelate modern arles as epitomized in the career of the frankish caesarius bishop of arles who was appointed bishop in caesarius was suspected of conspiring with the burgundians whose king had married the sister of clovis to assist the burgundians capture arles alaric exiled him for year to bordeaux in aquitania then allowed him to return unharmed when the crisis had passed alaric displayed similar wisdom in political affairs by appointing commission headed by the referendary anianus to prepare an abstract of the roman laws and imperial decrees which would form the authoritative code for his roman subjects this is generally known as the breviarium alaricianum or breviary of alaric legacy the alaric mountain near carcassonne is named after the visigoth king local rumour has it that he left vast treasure buried in the caves beneath the mountain the alaric canal in the hautes pyrénées department is named after him references further
