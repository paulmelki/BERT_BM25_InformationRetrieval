alexios iii angelos was byzantine emperor from march to july member of the extended imperial family alexios came to throne after deposing blinding and imprisoning his younger brother isaac ii angelos the most significant event of his reign was the attack of the fourth crusade on constantinople in on behalf of alexios iv angelos alexios iii took over the defence of the city which he mismanaged and then fled the city at night with one of his three daughters from adrianople and then mosynopolis he attempted unsuccessfully to rally his supporters only to end up captive of marquis boniface of montferrat he was ransomed sent to asia minor where he plotted against his son in law theodore laskaris but was eventually captured and spent his last days confined to the monastery of hyakinthos in nicaea where he died early life alexios iii angelos was the second son of andronikos doukas angelos and euphrosyne kastamonitissa andronikos was himself son of theodora komnene the youngest daughter of emperor alexios komnenos and irene doukaina thus alexios angelos was member of the extended imperial family together with his father and brothers alexios had conspired against emperor andronikos komnenos and thus he spent several years in exile in muslim courts including that of saladin his younger brother isaac was threatened with execution under orders of andronikos their first cousin once removed on september isaac made desperate attack on the imperial agents and soon killed their leader stephen he then took refuge in the church of hagia sophia and from there appealed to the populace his actions provoked riot which resulted in the deposition of andronikos and the proclamation of isaac as emperor alexios was now closer to the imperial throne than ever before reign alexios iii from promptuarii iconum insigniorum by alexios had returned to the court of his younger brother from whom he received the elevated title of sebastokratōr in march while isaac ii was away hunting in thrace alexios was acclaimed as emperor by the troops with the covert support of alexios wife euphrosyne doukaina kamatera alexios captured isaac at stagira in macedonia put out his eyes and thenceforth kept him close prisoner despite having previously been redeemed by alexios from captivity at antioch and showered with honours to compensate for this crime and to solidify his position as emperor alexios had to scatter money so lavishly as to empty his treasury and to allow such licence to the officers of the army as to leave the empire practically defenceless these actions inevitably led to the financial ruin of the state at christmas holy roman emperor henry vi attempted to force alexios to pay him tribute of pounds later negotiated down to pounds of gold or face invasion alexios gathered the money by plundering imperial tombs at the church of the holy apostles and heavily taxing the people through the alamanikon because of henry death in september the gold was never dispatched the able and forceful empress euphrosyne tried in vain to sustain his credit and his court vatatzes the favourite instrument in her attempts at reform was assassinated by the emperor orders in the east the empire was overrun by the seljuk turks from the north the kingdom of hungary and the rebellious bulgarians and vlachs descended unchecked to ravage the balkan provinces of the empire sometimes penetrating as far as greece while alexios squandered the public treasure on his palaces and gardens and attempted to deal with the crisis through diplomatic means the emperor attempts to bolster the empire defences by special concessions to pronoiars notables in the frontier zone backfired as the latter increased their regional autonomy byzantine authority survived but in much weakened state in local lord dobromir chrysos established himself in region of vardar macedonia defying the imperial power for several years during first years of alexios reign relations between byzantium and serbia were good since his daughter eudokia angelina was married to serbian grand prince stefan nemanjić who was granted the title of sebastokrator but in those relations deteriorated marriage between stefan and eudokia was dissolved and alliance between serbia and byzantium ended leaving byzantium without single ally in southeastern europe fourth crusade soon alexios was threatened by new and more formidable danger in soldiers assembled at venice to launch the fourth crusade alexios iv angelos the son of the deposed isaac ii had recently escaped from constantinople and now appealed for support to the crusaders promising to end the east west schism to pay for their transport and to provide military support if they would help him depose his uncle and ascend to his father throne the crusaders whose objective had been egypt were persuaded to set their course for constantinople arriving there in june proclaiming alexios iv as emperor and inviting the populace of the capital to depose his uncle alexios iii took no effective measures to resist and his attempts to bribe the crusaders failed his son in law theodore laskaris who was the only one to attempt anything significant was defeated at scutari and the siege of constantinople began unfortunately for the city misgovernment by alexios iii had left the byzantine navy with only worm eaten hulks by the time the crusaders arrived in july the crusaders led by the aged doge enrico dandolo scaled the walls and took control of major section of the city in the ensuing fighting the crusaders set the city on fire ultimately leaving people homeless on july alexios iii finally took action and led divisions from the st romanus gate vastly outnumbering the crusaders his courage failed however and the byzantine army returned to the city without fight his courtiers demanded action and alexios iii promised to fight instead that night july alexios iii hid in the palace and finally with one of his daughters eirene and as much treasure pounds of gold as he could collect got into boat and escaped to debeltos in thrace leaving his wife and his other daughters behind isaac ii drawn
