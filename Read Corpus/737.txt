apollo was the tenth crewed mission in the united states apollo space program the fifth and penultimate to land on the moon and the second to land in the lunar highlands the second of apollo missions it was crewed by commander john young lunar module pilot charles duke and command module pilot ken mattingly launched from the kennedy space center in florida at pm est on april the mission lasted days hour and minutes and concluded at est on april after flying the apollo lunar module to the moon surface on april young and duke spent hours just under three days on the lunar surface during which they conducted three extra vehicular activities or moonwalks totaling hours and minutes the pair drove the lunar roving vehicle lrv the second produced and used on the moon for on the surface young and duke collected of lunar samples for return to earth while command module pilot ken mattingly orbited in the command and service module csm above to perform observations mattingly staying with the command module spent hours and revolutions in lunar orbit after young and duke rejoined mattingly in lunar orbit the crew released subsatellite from the service module sm during the return trip to earth mattingly performed one hour spacewalk to retrieve several film cassettes from the exterior of the service module apollo landing spot in the highlands was chosen to allow the astronauts to gather geologically older lunar material than the samples obtained in three of the first four moon landings which were in or near lunar maria apollo landed in the fra mauro highlands samples from the descartes formation and the cayley formation disproved hypothesis that the formations were volcanic in origin crew mattingly had originally been assigned to the prime crew of apollo but was exposed to rubella through duke at that time on the back up crew for apollo who had caught it from one of his children he never contracted the illness but was nevertheless removed from the crew and replaced by his backup jack swigert three days before the launch young captain in the united states navy had flown on three spaceflights prior to apollo gemini gemini and apollo which orbited the moon one of astronauts selected by nasa in april duke had never flown in space before apollo he served on the support crew of apollo and was capsule communicator capcom for apollo backup crew although not officially announced the original backup crew consisted of fred haise cdr william pogue cmp and gerald carr lmp who were targeted for the prime crew assignment on apollo however after the cancellations of apollos and were finalized in september this crew would not rotate to lunar mission as planned subsequently roosa and mitchell were recycled to serve as members of the backup crew after returning from apollo while pogue and carr were reassigned to the skylab program where they flew on skylab support crew anthony england karl henize henry hartsfield jr robert overmyer donald peterson mission insignia the insignia of apollo is dominated by rendering of an american eagle and red white and blue shield representing the people of the united states over gray background representing the lunar surface overlaying the shield is gold nasa vector orbiting the moon on its gold outlined blue border there are stars representing the mission number and the names of the crew members young mattingly duke the insignia was designed from ideas originally submitted by the crew of the mission silver robbins medallion planning and training landing site selection apollo was the second of the apollo type missions featuring the use of the lunar roving vehicle increased scientific capability and lunar surface stays of three days as apollo was the penultimate mission in the apollo program and there was no new hardware or procedures to test on the lunar surface the last two missions the other being apollo presented opportunities for astronauts to clear up some uncertainties in understanding the moon properties although previous apollo expeditions including apollo and apollo obtained samples of pre mare lunar material before lava began to upwell from the moon interior and flood the low areas and basins none had actually visited the lunar highlands apollo had visited and sampled ridge of material ejected by the impact that created the mare imbrium impact basin likewise apollo had also sampled material in the region of imbrium visiting the basin edge there remained the possibility because the apollo and apollo landing sites were closely associated with the imbrium basin that different geologic processes were prevalent in areas of the lunar highlands far from mare imbrium several members of the scientific community remarked that the central lunar highlands resembled regions on earth that were created by volcanic processes and hypothesized the same might be true on the moon they hoped scientific output from the apollo mission would provide an answer location of the apollo landing site oblique closeup of the proposed apollo landing site as photographed by apollo from lunar orbit north ray crater is at left and south ray crater is at right with bright rays two locations on the moon were given primary consideration for exploration by the apollo expedition the descartes highlands region west of mare nectaris and the crater alphonsus at descartes the cayley and descartes formations were the primary areas of interest in that scientists suspected based on telescopic and orbital imagery that the terrain found there was formed by magma more viscous than what had formed the lunar maria the cayley formation age was approximated to be about the same as mare imbrium based on the local frequency of impact craters the considerable distance between the descartes site and previous apollo landing sites would be beneficial for the network of geophysical instruments portions of which were deployed on each apollo expedition beginning with apollo at the alphonsus three scientific objectives were determined to be of primary interest and paramount importance the possibility of old pre imbrium impact material from within the crater
