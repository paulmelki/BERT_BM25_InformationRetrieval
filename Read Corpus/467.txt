aphrodite venus his father was first cousin of king priam of troy both being grandsons of ilus founder of troy making aeneas second cousin to priam children such as hector and paris he is character in greek mythology and is mentioned in homer iliad aeneas receives full treatment in roman mythology most extensively in virgil aeneid where he is cast as an ancestor of romulus and remus he became the first true hero of rome snorri sturluson identifies him with the norse god vidarr of the æsir etymology aenea with portrait of aeneas bce aeneas is the romanization of the greek is first introduced in the homeric hymn to aphrodite when aphrodite gives him his name from the adjective terrible for the terrible grief he has caused her it is popular etymology for the name apparently exploited by homer in the iliad later in the medieval period there were writers who held that because the aeneid was written by philosopher it is meant to be read philosophically as such in the natural order the meaning of aeneas name combines greek dweller with body which becomes or in dweller as god inhabiting mortal body however there is no certainty regarding the origin of his name epithets in imitation of the iliad virgil borrows epithets of homer including anchisiades magnanimum magnus heros and bonus though he borrows many virgil gives aeneas two epithets of his own in the aeneid pater and pius the epithets applied by virgil are an example of an attitude different from that of homer for whilst odysseus is wily aeneas is described as pious which conveys strong moral tone the purpose of these epithets seems to enforce the notion of aeneas divine hand as father and founder of the roman race and their use seems circumstantial when aeneas is praying he refers to himself as pius and is referred to as such by the author only when the character is acting on behalf of the gods to fulfill his divine mission likewise aeneas is called pater when acting in the interest of his men greek

herself as if for wedding among the gods and appears before him he is overcome by her beauty believing that she is goddess but aphrodite identifies herself as phrygian princess after they make love aphrodite reveals her true identity to him and anchises fears what might happen to him as result of their liaison aphrodite assures him that he will be protected and tells him that she will bear him son to be called aeneas however she warns him that he must never tell anyone that he has lain with goddess when aeneas is born aphrodite takes him to the nymphs of mount ida she directs them to raise the child to age five then take him to anchises according to other sources anchises later brags about his encounter with aphrodite and as result is struck in the foot with thunderbolt by zeus thereafter he is lame in that foot so that aeneas has to carry him from the flames of troy homer iliad aeneas carrying anchises black figured oinochoe bce louvre aeneas is minor character in the iliad where he is twice saved from death by the gods as if for an as yet unknown destiny but is an honorable warrior in his own right having held back from the fighting aggrieved with priam because in spite
