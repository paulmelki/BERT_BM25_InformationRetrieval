the talmud yannai was questionable desecrated priest rumour had it that his mother was captured in modiin and violated and in the opinion of the pharisees was not allowed to serve in the temple this infuriated the king and he sided with the sadducees who defended him this incident led the king to turn against the pharisees and he persecute them until his death war with ptolemy lathyrus alexander first expedition was against the city of ptolemais while alexander went ahead to besiege the city zoilus of dora took the opportunity to see if he could relieve ptolemais in hopes of establishing his rule over coastal territories alexander hasmonean army quickly defeated zoilus forces ptolemais then requested aid from ptolemy ix lathyros who had been banished by his mother cleopatra iii ptolemy founded kingdom in cyprus after being cast out by his mother the situation at ptolemais was seized as an opportunity by ptolemy to possibly gain stronghold and control the judean coast in order to invade egypt by sea however an individual named demaenetus convinced the inhabitants of their imprudence in requesting ptolemy assistance they realised that by allying themselves with ptolemy they had unintentionally declared war on cleopatra when ptolemy arrived at the city the inhabitants denied him access alexander too didn want to be involved in war between cleopatra and ptolemy so he abandoned his campaign against ptolemais and returned to jerusalem after offering ptolemy four hundred talents and peace treaty in return for zoilus death alexander met him with treachery by negotiating an alliance with cleopatra once he had formed an alliance with ptolemy alexader continued his conquests by capturing the coastal cities of dora and straton tower as soon as ptolemy learned of alexander scheme he was determined to kill him ptolemy put ptolemais under siege but left his generals to attack the city while he continued to pursue alexander ptolemy pursuit caused much destruction in the
