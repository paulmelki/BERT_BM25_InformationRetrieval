ancylopoda is group of browsing herbivorous mammals in the perissodactyla that show long curved and cleft claws morphological evidence indicates the ancylopoda diverged from the tapirs rhinoceroses and horses after the brontotheria however earlier authorities such as osborn sometimes considered the ancylopoda to be outside perissodactyla or as was popular more recently to be related to brontotheria macrotherium which is typically from the middle miocene of sansan in gers france may indicate distinct genus limb bones resembling those of macrotherium but relatively stouter have been described from the pliocene beds of attica and samos as ancylotherium in the americas the names morothorium and moropus have been applied to similar bones in the belief that they indicated xenarthrans macrotherium magnum must have been an animal of about nine feet in length the south american genus homalodotherium is sometimes placed in the ancylopoda but arguments against this have been given by professor osborn who considers that the ancylopoda are directly descended from the condylarthra references
