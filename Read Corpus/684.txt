american english ame ae ameng useng en us sometimes called united states english or english is the set of varieties of the english language native to the united states currently american english is the most influential form of english worldwide english is the most widely spoken language in the united states and is the de facto common language used by the federal and state governments to the extent that all laws and compulsory education presume english as the primary language english is explicitly given official status by of the state governments while the local courts in some divisions of the united states grant equivalent status to both english and another language for example english and spanish in puerto rico under federal law english is still the official language for any matters being referred to the united states district court for the territory american english varieties include many patterns of pronunciation vocabulary grammar and particularly spelling that are unified nationwide but distinct from other english dialects around the world any american or canadian accent perceived as free of noticeably local ethnic or cultural markers is popularly called general or standard american fairly uniform accent continuum native to certain regions of the and associated nationally with broadcast mass media and highly educated speech however historical and present linguistic evidence does not support the notion of there being one single mainstream american accent the sound of american english continues to evolve with some local accents disappearing but several larger regional accents having emerged in the th century history the use of english in the united states is result of british colonization of the americas the first wave of english speaking settlers arrived in north america during the th century followed by further migrations in the th and th centuries during the th century dialects from many different regions of england existed in every american colony allowing process of extensive dialect mixture and leveling in which english varieties across the colonies became more homogeneous compared with varieties in england english thus predominated in the colonies even by the end of the th century first massive immigration of non english speakers from europe and africa and firsthand descriptions of fairly uniform american english became common after the mid th century since then american english has developed into some new varieties including regional dialects that in some cases show minor influences in the last two centuries from successive waves of immigrant speakers of diverse languages primarily european languages phonology compared with english as spoken in the united kingdom north american english is more homogeneous and any phonologically unremarkable north american accent is known as general american this section mostly refers to such general american features conservative phonology studies on historical usage of english in both the united states and the united kingdom suggest that spoken american english did not simply deviate away from period british english but is conservative in some ways preserving certain features contemporary british english has since lost full rhoticity or fulness is typical of american accents pronouncing the phoneme corresponding to the letter in all environments including after vowels such as in pearl car and court non rhotic american accents those that do not pronounce except before vowel such as some eastern new england new york specific few often older southern and african american vernacular accents are often quickly noticed by general american listeners and perceived to sound especially ethnic regional or old fashioned rhoticity is common in most american accents yet nowadays rare in england because during the th century british colonization nearly all dialects of english were rhotic and most north american english simply remained that way this preservation of rhoticity in north america was also supported by continuing waves of rhotic accented scotch irish immigrants most intensely during the th century and moderately during the following two centuries when the scotch irish eventually made up one seventh of the colonial population scotch irish settlers spread from delaware and pennsylvania throughout the larger mid atlantic region the inland regions of both the south and north and throughout the west all american dialect areas that consistently resisted upper class non rhotic influences and that consequently remain rhotic today the pronunciation of is postalveolar approximant or retroflex approximant though unique bunched tongue variant of the approximant sound is also associated with the united states and perhaps mostly in the midwest and the south for those american accents that have not undergone the cot caught merger the lexical sets and they have instead retained split th century split in which certain words labeled as the lexical set separated away from the set this split which has now reversed in most british english simultaneously shifts this relatively recent set into merger with the caught set having taken place prior to the unrounding of the cot vowel this results in lengthening and perhaps raising merging the more recently separated vowel into the vowel in the following environments before many instances of and particularly as in austria cloth cost loss off often etc few instances before as in strong long wrong and variably by region or speaker in gone on and certain other words the standard accent of southern england received pronunciation rp has evolved in other ways too compared to which general american english has remained relatively more conservative for example regarding today rp features of trap bath split and the fronting of neither of which is typical of general american accents moreover american dialects do not participate in dropping an innovative feature that now characterizes perhaps majority of the regional dialects of england innovative phonology on the other hand general american is more innovative than the dialects of england or english elsewhere in the world in number of its own ways unrounded the american phenomenon of the vowel often spelled in words like box don clock notch pot etc being produced without rounded lips like the vowel allows father and bother to rhyme the two vowels now unified as the single phoneme this father
