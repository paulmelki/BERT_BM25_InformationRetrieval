the acre is unit of land area used in the imperial and us customary systems it is traditionally defined as the area of one chain by one furlong by feet which is exactly equal to square chains of square mile or square feet and approximately or about of hectare based upon the international yard and pound agreement of an acre may be declared as exactly square metres one recognised symbol for the acre is ac but the word acre is also used as the symbol the acre is statute measure in the united states in the united kingdom and in almost all countries of the former british empire in most it is lawful to use for trade if given as supplementary information and is not used for land registration in the united states both the international acre and the us survey acre are in use but they differ by only two parts per million see below the most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land traditionally in the middle ages an acre was defined as the area of land that could be ploughed in one day by yoke of oxen description one acre equals square mile square yards square feet or about see below while all modern variants of the acre contain square yards there are alternative definitions of yard so the exact size of an acre depends upon the particular yard on which it is based originally an acre was understood as selion of land sized at forty perches ft or furlong long and four perches ft wide this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land yoke of oxen could plough in one day furlong being furrow long square enclosing one acre is approximately yards or feet inches on side as unit of measure an acre has no prescribed shape any area of square feet is an acre us survey acres in the international yard and pound agreement of the united states and five countries of the commonwealth of nations defined the international yard to be exactly metre the us authorities decided that while the refined definition would apply nationally in all other respects the us survey foot and thus the survey acre would continue until such time as it becomes desirable and expedient to readjust it by inference an international acre may be calculated as exactly square metres but it does not have basis in any international agreement both the international acre and the us survey acre contain of square mile or square yards but alternative definitions of yard are used see survey foot and survey yard so the exact size of an acre depends upon which yard it is based the us survey acre is about square metres its exact value is based on an inch defined by metre inches exactly as established by the mendenhall order of surveyors in the united states use both international and survey feet and consequently both varieties of acre since the difference between the us survey acre and international acre square metres square centimetres or square inches is only about quarter of the size of an sheet or us letter it is usually not important which one is being discussed areas are seldom measured with sufficient accuracy for the different definitions to be detectable in october national geodetic survey and national institute of standards and technology announced their joint intent to end the temporary continuance of the us survey foot mile and acre units as permitted by their decision above with effect from the end of spanish acre the puerto rican cuerda is sometimes called the spanish acre in the continental united states use the acre is commonly used in number of current and former commonwealth countries by custom and in few it continues as statute measure these include antigua and barbuda american samoa the bahamas belize the british virgin islands the cayman islands dominica the falkland islands grenada ghana guam the northern mariana islands jamaica montserrat samoa saint lucia st helena st kitts and nevis st vincent and the grenadines turks and caicos the united kingdom the united states and the us virgin islands south asia in india residential plots are measured in square feet while agricultural land is measured in acres in sri lanka the division of an acre into perches or roods is common in pakistan residential plots is measured in kanal marla kanal sq yards and open agriculture land measurement is in acres kanal acre and muraba acre muraba kanals jerib wiswa and gunta united kingdom its use as primary unit for trade in the united kingdom ceased to be permitted from october due to the amendment of the weights and measures act where it was replaced by the hectare though its use as supplementary unit continues to be permitted indefinitely this was with exemption of land registration which records the sale and possession of land in hm land registry ended its exemption the measure is still used to communicate with the public and informally non contract by the farming and property industries equivalence to other units of area the area of one acre red superposed on an american football field green and association

survey acre is equal to hectare square metres square kilometre is equal to acres acre both variants is equal to the following customary units feet feet square feet square chains chain feet yards rods links acre is approximately feet feet square square yards square feet perches perch is equal to square rod square rod is acre roods furlong by chain furlong yards chain yards rods by rods rods historically fencing was often sold in rod lengths square mile square mile is equal to acres perhaps the easiest way for us residents to envision an acre is as rectangle measuring yards by yards
