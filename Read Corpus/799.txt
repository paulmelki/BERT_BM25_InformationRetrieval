aphasia is an inability to comprehend or formulate language because of damage to specific brain regions the major causes are cerebral vascular accident stroke or head trauma but aphasia can also be the result of brain tumors brain infections or diseases however the latter are far less common and so not as often mentioned when discussing aphasia to be diagnosed with aphasia person speech or language must be significantly impaired in one or more of the four aspects of communication following acquired brain injury or have significant decline over short time period progressive aphasia the four aspects of communication are auditory comprehension verbal expression reading and writing and functional communication the difficulties of people with aphasia can range from occasional trouble finding words to losing the ability to speak read or write intelligence however is unaffected expressive language and receptive language can both be affected as well aphasia also affects visual language such as sign language in contrast the use of formulaic expressions in everyday communication is often preserved for example while person with aphasia particularly broca aphasia may not be able to ask loved one when their birthday is they may still be able to sing happy birthday one prevalent deficit in the aphasias is anomia which is difficulty in finding the correct word with aphasia one or more modes of communication in the brain have been damaged and are therefore functioning incorrectly aphasia is not caused by damage to the brain that results in motor or sensory deficits which produces abnormal speech that is aphasia is not related to the mechanics of speech but rather the individual language cognition although person can have both problems particularly if they suffered hemorrhage that damaged large area of the brain an individual language is the socially shared set of rules as well as the thought processes that go behind verbalized speech it is not result of more peripheral motor or sensory difficulty such as paralysis affecting the speech muscles or general hearing impairment aphasia affects about million people in the us and people in great britain nearly people acquire the disorder every year in the us alone any person of any age can develop aphasia given that it is often caused by traumatic injury however people who are middle aged and older are the most likely to experience the problem older individuals have the highest risk of developing aphasia because the danger of stroke increases with age approximately of all strokes occur in individuals over the age of strokes account for most documented cases of aphasia of people who survive stroke develop aphasia as result of damage to the language processing regions of the brain aphasia and dysphasia technically dysphasia means impaired language and aphasia means lack of language there have been calls to use the term aphasia regardless of severity reasons for doing so include dysphasia being easily confused with the swallowing disorder dysphagia consumers and speech pathologists preferring the term aphasia and many languages other than english using word similar to aphasia it would appear that the term aphasia is more commonly encountered in north america while dysphasia is more frequently found in british literature signs and symptoms people with aphasia may experience any of the following behaviors due to an acquired brain injury although some of these symptoms may be due to related or concomitant problems such as dysarthria or apraxia and not primarily due to aphasia aphasia symptoms can vary based on the location of damage in the brain signs and symptoms may or may not be present in individuals with aphasia and may vary in severity and level of disruption to communication often those with aphasia will try to hide their inability to name objects by using words like thing so when asked to name pencil they may say it is thing used to write inability to comprehend language inability to pronounce not due to muscle paralysis or weakness inability to speak spontaneously inability to form words inability to name objects anomia poor enunciation excessive creation and use of personal neologisms inability to repeat phrase persistent repetition of one syllable word or phrase stereotypies recurrent recurring utterances speech automatism paraphasia substituting letters syllables or words agrammatism inability to speak in grammatically correct fashion dysprosody alterations in inflexion stress and rhythm incomplete sentences inability to read inability to write limited verbal output difficulty in naming speech disorder speaking gibberish inability to follow or understand simple requests related behaviors given the previously stated signs and symptoms the following behaviors are often seen in people with aphasia as result of attempted compensation for incurred speech and language deficits self repairs further disruptions in fluent speech as result of mis attempts to repair erred speech production speech disfluencies include previously mentioned disfluencies including repetitions and prolongations at the phonemic syllable and word level presenting in pathological severe levels of frequency struggle in non fluent aphasias severe increase in expelled effort to speak after life where talking and communicating was an ability that came so easily can cause visible frustration preserved and automatic language behavior in which some language or language sequences that were used so frequently prior to onset they still possess the ability to produce them with more ease than other language post onset poor eyesight oral dysmorphia usually characterized by tingling in the arms and legs and sometimes heart disorders subcortical subcortical aphasias characteristics and symptoms depend upon the site and size of subcortical lesion possible sites of lesions include the thalamus internal capsule and basal ganglia causes regions of the left hemisphere that can give rise to aphasia when damaged aphasia is most often caused by stroke but any disease or damage to the parts of the brain that control language can cause aphasia some of these can include brain tumors traumatic brain injury and progressive neurological disorders in rare cases aphasia may also result from herpesviral encephalitis the herpes simplex virus affects the frontal and temporal lobes subcortical structures and the hippocampal tissue which can trigger
