brothers æthelbald æthelberht and æthelred reigned in turn before him after ascending the throne alfred spent several years fighting viking invasions he won decisive victory in the battle of edington in and made an agreement with the vikings creating what was known as the danelaw in the north of england alfred also oversaw the conversion of viking leader guthrum to christianity he defended his kingdom against the viking attempt at conquest becoming the dominant ruler in england details of his life are described in work by th century welsh scholar and bishop asser alfred had reputation as learned and merciful man of gracious and level headed nature who encouraged education proposing that primary education be conducted in old english rather than latin and improving the legal system and military structure and his people quality of life he was given the epithet the great during and after the reformation in the th century and together with danish cnut the great is the only king of england to be given such name family alfred was son of æthelwulf king of wessex and his wife osburh according to his biographer asser writing in in the year of our lord incarnation alfred king of the anglo saxons was born at the royal estate called wantage in the district known as berkshire which is so called from berroc wood where the box tree grows very abundantly this date has been accepted by the editors of asser biography simon keynes and michael lapidge and by other historians such as david dumville and richard huscroft however west saxon genealogical lists state that alfred was when he became king in april implying that he was born between april and april this dating is adopted in the biography of alfred by alfred smyth who regards asser biography as fraudulent an allegation which is rejected by other historians richard abels in his biography discusses both sources but does not decide between them and dates alfred birth as while patrick wormald in his oxford dictionary of national biography article dates it berkshire had been historically disputed between wessex and mercia and as late as charter showed that it was part of mercia but alfred birth in the county is evidence that by the late control had passed to wessex he was the youngest of six children his eldest brother æthelstan was old enough to be appointed sub king of kent in almost years before alfred was born he died in the early alfred next three brothers were successively kings of wessex æthelbald and æthelberht were also much older than alfred but æthelred was only year or two older alfred only known sister æthelswith married burgred king of the midland kingdom of mercia in most historians think that osburh was the mother of all æthelwulf children but some suggest that the older ones were born to an unrecorded first wife osburh was descended from the rulers of the isle of wight she was described by alfred biographer asser as most religious woman noble by temperament and noble by birth she died by when æthelwulf married judith daughter of charles the bald king of west francia in alfred married ealhswith daughter of the mercian nobleman æthelred mucel ealdorman of the gaini and his wife eadburh who was of royal mercian descent their children were æthelflæd who married æthelred lord of the mercians edward the elder his successor as king æthelgifu abbess of shaftesbury ælfthryth who married baldwin count of flanders and æthelweard background map of britain in alfred grandfather ecgberht became king of wessex in and in the view of the historian richard abels it must have seemed very unlikely to contemporaries that he would establish lasting dynasty for years three families had fought for the west saxon throne and no son had followed his father as king no ancestor of ecgberht had been king of wessex since ceawlin in the late sixth century but he was believed to be paternal descendant of cerdic the founder of the west saxon dynasty this made ecgberht an ætheling prince eligible for the throne but after ecgberht reign descent from cerdic was no longer sufficient to make man an ætheling when ecgberht died in he was succeeded by his son æthelwulf all subsequent west saxon kings were descendants of ecgberht and æthelwulf and were also sons of kings at the beginning of the ninth century england was almost wholly under the control of the anglo saxons mercia dominated southern england but its supremacy came to an end in when it was decisively defeated by ecgberht at the battle of ellendun the two kingdoms became allies which was important in the resistance to viking attacks in king burgred of mercia requested west saxon help to suppress welsh rebellion and æthelwulf led west saxon contingent in successful joint campaign in the same year burgred married æthelwulf daughter æthelswith in ecgberht sent æthelwulf to invade the mercian sub kingdom of kent and its sub king baldred was driven out shortly afterwards by essex surrey and sussex had submitted to ecgberht and he had appointed æthelwulf to rule the south eastern territories as king of kent the vikings ravaged the isle of sheppey in and the following year they defeated ecgberht at carhampton in somerset but in he was victorious over an alliance of cornishmen and vikings at the battle of hingston down reducing cornwall to the status of client kingdom when æthelwulf succeeded he appointed his eldest son æthelstan as sub king of kent ecgberht and æthelwulf may not have intended permanent union between wessex and kent because they both appointed sons as sub kings and charters in wessex were attested witnessed by west saxon magnates and kentish charters were witnessed by the kentish elite both kings kept overall
