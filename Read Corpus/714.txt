sir alexander fleming august march was scottish physician and microbiologist best known for discovering the enzyme lysozyme and the world first broadly effective antibiotic substance which he named penicillin he discovered lysozyme from his nasal discharge in and along with it bacterium he named micrococcus lysodeikticus later renamed micrococcus luteus his discovery of what is later named or penicillin from the mould penicillium rubens in is described as the single greatest victory ever achieved over disease for this discovery he shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in with howard florey and ernst boris chain fleming was knighted for his scientific achievements in in he was named in time magazine list of the most important people of the th century in he was chosen in the bbc television poll for determining the greatest britons and in he was also voted third greatest scot in an opinion poll conducted by stv behind only robert burns and william wallace early life and education born on august at lochfield farm near darvel in ayrshire scotland alexander fleming was the third of four children of farmer hugh fleming and grace stirling morton the daughter of neighbouring farmer hugh fleming had four surviving children from his first marriage he was at the time of his second marriage to grace and died when alexander was seven fleming went to loudoun moor school and darvel school and earned two year scholarship to kilmarnock academy before moving to london where he attended the royal polytechnic institution after working in shipping office for four years the twenty year old alexander fleming inherited some money from an uncle john fleming his elder brother tom was already physician and suggested to him that he should follow the same career and so in the younger alexander enrolled at st mary hospital medical school in paddington he qualified with an mbbs degree from the school with distinction in fleming who was private in the london scottish regiment of the volunteer force from to had been member of the rifle club at the medical school the captain of the club wishing to retain fleming in the team suggested that he join the research department at st mary where he became assistant bacteriologist to sir almroth wright pioneer in vaccine therapy and immunology in he gained bsc degree with gold medal in bacteriology and became lecturer at st mary until commissioned lieutenant in and promoted captain in fleming served throughout world war in the royal army medical corps and was mentioned in dispatches he and many of his colleagues worked in battlefield hospitals at the western front in france in he returned to st mary hospital where he was elected professor of bacteriology of the university of london in in he was elected the rector of the university of edinburgh for term of three years scientific contributions antiseptics during world war fleming with leonard colebrook and sir almroth wright joined the war efforts and practically moved the entire inoculation department of st mary to the british military hospital at boulogne sur mer serving as temporary lieutenant of the royal army medical corps he witnessed the death of many soldiers from sepsis resulting from infected wounds antiseptics which were used at the time to treat infected wounds he observed often worsened the injuries in an article published in the medical journal the lancet in he described an ingenious experiment which he was able to conduct as result of his own glass blowing skills in which he explained why antiseptics were killing more soldiers than infection itself during the war antiseptics worked well on the surface but deep wounds tended to shelter anaerobic bacteria from the antiseptic agent and antiseptics seemed to remove beneficial agents produced that protected the patients in these cases at least as well as they removed bacteria and did nothing to remove the bacteria that were out of reach wright strongly supported fleming findings but despite this most army physicians over the course of the war continued to use antiseptics even in cases where this worsened the condition of the patients discovery of lysozyme at st mary hospital fleming continued his investigations into bacteria culture and antibacterial substances as his research scholar at the time allison recalled fleming was not tidy researcher and usually expected unusual bacterial growths in his culture plates fleming had tease allison of his excessive tidiness in the laboratory and allison rightly attributed such untidiness as the success of fleming experiments and said if he had been as tidy as he thought was he would not have made his two great discoveries in the late while he was maintaining agar plates for bacteria he found that one of the plates was contaminated with bacteria from the air when he added nasal mucus he found that the mucus inhibited the bacterial growth surrounding the mucus area was clear transparent circle cm from the mucus indicating the killing zone of bacteria followed by glassy and translucent ring beyond which was an opaque area indicating normal bacterial growth in the next test he used bacteria maintained in saline that formed an yellow suspension within two minutes of adding fresh mucus the yellow saline turned completely clear he extended his tests using tears which were contributed by his co workers as allison reminisced saying for the next five or six weeks our tears were the source of supply for this extraordinary phenomenon many were the lemons we used after the failure of onions to produce flow of tears the demand by us for tears was so great that laboratory attendants were pressed into service receiving threepence for each contribution his further tests with sputum cartilage blood semen ovarian cyst fluid pus and egg white showed that the bactericidal agent was present in all of these he reported his discovery before the medical research club in december and before the royal society the next year but failed to stir any interest as allison recollected was present at this medical research club meeting as
