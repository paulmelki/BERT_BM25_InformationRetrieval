autism is developmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior parents often notice signs during the first three years of their child life these signs often develop gradually though some children with autism experience worsening in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at normal pace autism is associated with combination of genetic and environmental factors risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections such as rubella toxins including valproic acid alcohol cocaine pesticides lead and air pollution fetal growth restriction and autoimmune diseases controversies surround other proposed environmental causes for example the vaccine hypothesis which has been disproven autism affects information processing in the brain and how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm combines autism and less severe forms of the condition including asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified pdd nos into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder asd early behavioral interventions or speech therapy can help children with autism gain self care social and communication skills although there is no known cure there have been cases of children who recovered some autistic adults are unable to live independently an autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking cure and others believing autism should be accepted as difference to be accommodated instead of cured globally autism is estimated to affect million people in the the number of people affected was estimated at per people worldwide in the developed countries about of children are diagnosed with asd from in in the united states it occurs four to five times more often in males than females the number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the which may be partly due to changes in diagnostic practice the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved characteristics autism is highly variable disorder whose symptoms first appear during infancy or childhood and generally follows steady course without remission people with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but average or even superior in others overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form it is distinguished by characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and repetitive behavior other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits social development social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders asd see classification from other developmental disorders people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with typical neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on mars unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as pointing at things three to five year old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others however they do form attachments to their primary caregivers most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less pronounced autistic traits older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to lower ability to define person own emotions children with high functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non autistic peers despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism for them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply there are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with asd the limited data suggest that in children with intellectual disability autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and meltdowns communication about third to half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver in the second and third years children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or reverse pronouns joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd for example they may look at pointing hand instead of the pointed at object and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language in pair of studies high functioning children with autism aged performed equally well as and as adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension
