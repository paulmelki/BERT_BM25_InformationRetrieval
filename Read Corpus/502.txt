raiders before securing settlement with gruffydd ap llywelyn welsh ruler in ealdred was elected to the archbishopric of york but had difficulty in obtaining papal approval for his appointment managing to do so only when he promised not to hold the bishoprics of york and worcester simultaneously he helped secure the election of wulfstan as his successor at worcester during his archiepiscopate he built and embellished churches in his diocese and worked to improve his clergy by holding synod which published regulations for the priesthood some sources say that following king edward the confessor death in it was ealdred who crowned harold godwinson as king of england ealdred supported harold as king but when harold was defeated at the battle of hastings ealdred backed edgar the ætheling and then endorsed king william the conqueror the duke of normandy and distant relative of king edward ealdred crowned king william on christmas day in william never quite trusted ealdred or the other english leaders and ealdred had to accompany william back to normandy in but he had returned to york by the time of his death in ealdred supported the churches and monasteries in his diocese with gifts and building projects early life ealdred was probably born in the west of england and could be related to lyfing his predecessor as bishop of worcester his family from devonshire may have been well to do another relative was wilstan or wulfstan who under ealdred influence became abbot of gloucester ealdred was monk in the cathedral chapter at winchester cathedral before becoming abbot of tavistock abbey about an office he held until about even after leaving the abbacy of tavistock he continued to hold two properties from the abbey until his death no contemporary documents relating to ealdred time as abbot have been discovered ealdred was made bishop of worcester in position he held until his resignation in he may have acted as suffragan or subordinate bishop to his predecessor lyfing before formally assuming the bishopric as from about ealdred witnessed as an episcopus or bishop and charter from or early names sihtric as abbot of tavistock lyfing died on march and ealdred became bishop of worcester shortly after however ealdred did not receive the other two dioceses lyfing had held crediton and cornwall king edward the confessor reigned granted these to leofric who combined the two sees at crediton in bishop and royal advisor ealdred was an advisor to king edward the confessor and was often involved in the royal government he was also military leader and in he led an unsuccessful expedition against the welsh this was in retaliation for raid led by the welsh rulers gruffydd ap rhydderch rhys ap rhydderch and gruffydd ap llywelyn ealdred expedition was betrayed by some welsh soldiers who were serving with the english and ealdred was defeated in ealdred went to rome on the king errand apparently to secure papal approval to move the seat or centre of the bishopric of crediton to exeter it may also have been to secure the release of the king from vow to go on pilgrimage if sources from after the norman conquest of england are to be believed while in rome he attended papal council along with his fellow english bishop herman that same year as ealdred was returning to england he met sweyn son of godwin earl of wessex and probably absolved sweyn for having abducted the abbess of leominster abbey in through ealdred intercession sweyn was restored to his earldom which he had lost after abducting the abbess and murdering his cousin beorn estrithson ealdred helped sweyn not only because ealdred was supporter of earl godwin family but because sweyn earldom was close to his bishopric as recently as irish raiders had allied with gruffydd ap rhydderch of gwent in raiding along the river usk ealdred unsuccessfully tried to drive off the raiders but was again routed by the welsh this failure underscored ealdred need for strong earl in the area to protect against raids normally the bishop of hereford would have led the defence in the absence of an earl of hereford but in the incumbent æthelstan was blind so ealdred took on the role of defender diplomatic travels harold godwinson from the alt tapestry image of man on horseback holding falcon earl godwin rebellion against the king in came as blow to ealdred who was supporter of the earl and his family ealdred was present at the royal council at london that banished godwin family later in when he was sent to intercept harold godwinson and his brothers as they fled england after their father outlawing ealdred could not or would not capture the brothers the banishment of ealdred patron came shortly after the death of ælfric puttoc the archbishop of york york and worcester had long had close ties and the two sees had often been held in plurality or at the same time ealdred probably wanted to become archbishop of york after ælfric death but his patron eclipse led to the king appointing cynesige royal chaplain instead in september though godwin returned from exile and his family was restored to power by late ealdred was
