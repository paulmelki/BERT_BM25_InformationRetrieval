the acorn electron is budget version of the bbc micro educational home computer introduced by acorn computers ltd on august it has kilobytes of ram and its rom includes bbc basic along with its operating system the electron was able to save and load programs onto audio cassette via supplied converter cable that connected it to any standard tape recorder that had the correct sockets it was capable of basic graphics and could display onto either television set colour rgb monitor or green screen monitor for short period the electron was reportedly the best selling micro in the united kingdom with an estimated to machines sold over its entire commercial lifespan history basic prompt after switch on or hard reset soft reset was similar but did not contain the acorn trademark after acorn computer released the bbc micro executives believed that the company needed less expensive computer for the mass market in may when asked about the recently announced sinclair zx spectrum potential to hurt sales of the bbc micro priced at for the model compared to around twice that price for the bbc model acorn co founder hermann hauser responded that in the third quarter of that year acorn would release new computer which will probably be called the electron form of miniaturised bbc micro having kb of ram and kb of rom with higher resolution graphics than those offered by the spectrum acorn chris curry also emphasised the electron role as being designed to compete with the spectrum to get the starting price very low but not preclude expansion in the long term in order to reduce component costs the company reduced the number of chips in the electron by from the bbc micro about with most functionality on single uncommitted logic array ula problems with the ula delayed the electron however and acorn repeatedly missed deadlines to ship the computer reports during the second half of indicated potential december release with curry providing qualified confirmation of such plans together with an accurate depiction of the machine form and capabilities noting that the massive ula would be the dominant factor in any pre christmas release however as the end of the year approached with the ula not ready for main production the launch of the electron was to be delayed until the spring acorn formally announced the electron at the acorn user exhibition in august one year after hauser mentioned the computer by which time its price had risen to while the spectrum cost the company expected to ship the electron before christmas and sell by february reviews were generally favorable noting its excellent graphics compared to the commodore while its speed was acceptable compared to the commodore and competing computers the electron was however much slower than the bbc micro popular computing weekly reported for example that bbc micro games ran at less than half the speed with very significant effects on their appeal the reduced performance can be attributed to the use of bit wide memory system instead of the bit wide memory system of the bbc micro to reduce cost due to needing two accesses to the memory instead of one to fetch each byte along with contention with the video hardware also needing access reading or writing ram was much slower than on the bbc micro the ula continued to cause problems delaying large scale manufacturing by october acorn had received orders for more than units and expected to produce month before christmas the existing backlog would take more than six months to fulfil demand for the electron was high but only two of wh smith london branches had inventory as the company increased production during however the british home computer market greatly weakened one acorn executive later said after christmas they were just delivering and the company ended up with million of unsaleable stock acorn christmas sales were greatly below expectations and in january the company reduced the electron price to in conjunction with an unsuccessful expansion into the united states by february acorn market capitalization declined from the previous year olivetti acquired the company later that year and dixons retail acquired the remaining electron inventory for less than manufacturing cost bringing this particular attempt at targeting the home computing market to an end acorn subsequently released the master compact model in the master series of microcomputers with fewer bbc micro style ports and similar expansion connector with the home audience specifically in mind with hindsight the large screen memory required too much processing power to manipulate and left too little space available to programs for the machine to take on the prevailing spectrum with less than of screen memory and commodore with hardware sprites in gaming despite this several features that would later be associated with bbc master and archimedes were first features of electron expansion units including rom cartridge slots and the advanced disc filing system hierarchical improvement to the bbc original disc filing system while it may not have been as popular as the spectrum commodore or amstrad cpc it did sell in sufficient numbers to ensure that new software was being produced right up until the early this meant the electron had lifespan not much shorter than those more popular micros and much longer than competitors such as the oric and dragon popular upgrades acorn plus an acorn electron with plus expansion unit attached the acorn plus added two rom cartridge slots an analogue interface supporting four channels and centronics parallel port the analogue interface was normally used for joysticks the parallel for printer game rom cartridges would boot automatically languages in paged rom cartridges would take precedence over basic the slot at the front of the interface took priority if both were populated access to rom occurred at mhz until ram access was required so theoretically programs released on rom could run up to twice as fast as those released on tape or disc despite this all of the games released on rom were packaged as rom filing
