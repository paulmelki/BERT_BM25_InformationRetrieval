one of the large detailed illustrations in andreas vesalius de humani corporis fabrica th century marking the rebirth of anatomy px anatomy greek anatomē dissection is the branch of biology concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts anatomy is branch of natural science which deals with the structural organization of living things it is an old science having its beginnings in prehistoric times anatomy is inherently tied to developmental biology embryology comparative anatomy evolutionary biology and phylogeny as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated both over immediate and long term timescales anatomy and physiology which study the structure and function of organisms and their parts respectively make natural pair of related disciplines and are often studied together human anatomy is one of the essential basic sciences that are applied in medicine the discipline of anatomy is divided into macroscopic and microscopic macroscopic anatomy or gross anatomy is the examination of an animal body parts using unaided eyesight gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the tissues of various structures known as histology and also in the study of cells the history of anatomy is characterized by progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body methods have also improved dramatically advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers corpses to th century medical imaging techniques including ray ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging definition dissected body lying prone on table by charles landseer derived from the greek anatomē dissection from anatémnō cut up cut open from ἀνά aná up and τέμνω témnō cut anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of organisms including their systems organs and tissues it includes the appearance and position of the various parts the materials from which they are composed their locations and their relationships with other parts anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved for example an anatomist is concerned with the shape size position structure blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver while physiologist is interested in the production of bile the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions the discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into number of branches including gross or macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy the study by sight of the external body features microscopic anatomy is the study of structures on microscopic scale along with histology the study of tissues and embryology the study of an organism in its immature condition anatomy can be studied using both invasive and non invasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems methods used include dissection in which body is opened and its organs studied and endoscopy in which video camera equipped instrument is inserted through small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures angiography using rays or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels the term anatomy is commonly taken to refer to human anatomy however substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals the term zootomy is also sometimes used to specifically refer to non human animals the structure and tissues of plants are of dissimilar nature and they are studied in plant anatomy animal tissues stylized cutaway diagram of an animal cell with flagella the kingdom animalia contains multicellular organisms that are heterotrophic and motile although some have secondarily adopted sessile lifestyle most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and these animals are also known as eumetazoans they have an internal digestive chamber with one or two openings the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs and the zygotes include blastula stage in their embryonic development metazoans do not include the sponges which have cells unlike plant cells animal cells have neither cell wall nor chloroplasts vacuoles when present are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell the body tissues are composed of numerous types of cell including those found in muscles nerves and skin each typically has cell membrane formed of phospholipids cytoplasm and nucleus all of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic germ layers those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called diploblastic and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called triploblastic all of triploblastic animal tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo the ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types connective epithelial muscle and nervous tissue hyaline cartilage at high magnification stain connective tissue connective tissues are fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place the main types are loose connective tissue adipose tissue fibrous connective tissue cartilage and bone the extracellular matrix contains proteins the chief and most abundant of which is collagen collagen plays major part in organizing and maintaining tissues the matrix can be modified to form skeleton to support or protect the body an exoskeleton is thickened rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization as in crustaceans or by the cross linking of its proteins as in insects an endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals as well as in many of those less developed epithelium gastric mucosa at low magnification stain epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules with
