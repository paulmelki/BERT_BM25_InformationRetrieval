the english language was first introduced to the americas by british colonisation beginning in the late th and early th centuries the language also spread to numerous other parts of the world as result of british trade and colonisation and the spread of the former british empire which by included about million people about quarter of the world population written forms of british and american english as found in newspapers and textbooks vary little in their essential features with only occasional noticeable differences over the past years the forms of the language used in the americas especially in the united states and that used in the united kingdom have diverged in few minor ways leading to the versions now often referred to as american english and british english differences between the two include pronunciation grammar vocabulary lexis spelling punctuation idioms and formatting of dates and numbers however the differences in written and most spoken grammar structure tend to be much less than in other aspects of the language in terms of mutual intelligibility few words have completely different meanings in the two versions or are even unknown or not used in one of the versions one particular contribution towards formalising these differences came from noah webster who wrote the first american dictionary published with the intention of showing that people in the united states spoke different dialect from those spoken in the uk much like regional accent this divergence between american english and british english has provided opportunities for humorous comment in fiction george bernard shaw says that the united states and united kingdom are two countries divided by common language and oscar wilde says that we have really everything in common with america nowadays except of course the language the canterville ghost henry sweet incorrectly predicted in that within century american english australian english and british english would be mutually unintelligible handbook of phonetics perhaps increased worldwide communication through radio television the internet and globalisation has tended to reduce regional variation this can lead to some variations becoming extinct for instance the wireless being progressively superseded by the radio or the acceptance of wide variations as perfectly good english everywhere although spoken american and british english are generally mutually intelligible there are occasional differences which might cause embarrassment for example in american english rubber is usually interpreted as condom rather than an eraser and british fanny refers to the female pubic area while the american fanny refers to an ass us or an arse uk word derivation and compounds directional suffix ward british forwards towards rightwards etc american forward toward rightward in both dialects distribution varies somewhat afterwards towards and backwards are not unusual in america while in the united kingdom upward and rightward are the more common options as is forward which is standard in phrasal verbs such as look forward to the forms with may be used as adverbs or preposition towards but rarely as adjectives in the uk as in america one says an upward motion the oxford english dictionary in suggested semantic distinction for adverbs with wards having more definite directional sense than ward subsequent authorities such as fowler have disputed this contention american english ame freely adds the suffix to day night evening weekend monday etc to form adverbs denoting repeated or customary action used to stay out evenings the library is closed saturdays this usage has its roots in old english but many of these constructions are now regarded as american for example the oed labels nights now chiefly amer colloq in constructions such as to sleep nights but to work nights is standard in british english in british english bre the agentive er suffix is commonly attached to football also cricket often netball occasionally basketball and volleyball ame usually uses football player where the sport name is usable as verb the suffixation is standard in both dialects for example golfer bowler in ten pin bowling and in lawn bowls and shooter ame appears sometimes to use the bre form in baller as slang for basketball player as in the video game nba ballers however this is derived from slang use of to ball as verb meaning to play basketball english writers everywhere occasionally make new compound words from common phrases for example health care is now being replaced by healthcare on both sides of the atlantic however ame has made certain words in this fashion that are still treated as phrases in bre in compound nouns of the form sometimes ame prefers the bare infinitive where bre favours the gerund examples include ame first jump rope skipping rope racecar racing car rowboat rowing boat sailboat sailing boat file cabinet filing cabinet dial tone dialling tone drainboard draining board generally ame has tendency to drop inflectional suffixes thus preferring clipped forms compare cookbook cookery book smith age smith aged skim milk skimmed milk dollhouse dolls house barber shop barber shop singular attributives in one country may be plural in the other and vice versa for example the uk has drugs problem while the united states has drug problem although the singular usage is also commonly heard in the uk americans read the sports section of newspaper the british are more likely to read the sport section however bre maths is singular just as ame math is both are abbreviations of mathematics some british english words come from french roots while american english finds its words from other places ame eggplant and zucchini are aubergine and courgette in bre similarly american english has occasionally replaced more traditional english words with their spanish counterparts this is especially common in regions historically affected by spanish settlement such as the american southwest and florida as well as other areas that have since experienced strong hispanic migration such as urban centers examples of these include grocery markets preference in the for spanish names such as cilantro and manzanilla over coriander and camomile respectively vocabulary the familiarity of speakers with words and phrases from different regions varies and the
