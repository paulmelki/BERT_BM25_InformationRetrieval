anaximenes of miletus was an ancient greek pre socratic philosopher active in the latter half of the th century bc the details of his life are obscure because none of his work has been preserved anaximenes ideas and philosophies are only known today because of comments made by aristotle and other writers on the history of greek philosophy as one of the three philosophers of the milesian school considered the first revolutionary thinkers of the western world anaximenes is best known and identified as younger friend or student of anaximander who was himself taught by thales each philosopher developed distinct cosmology without completely rejecting their teacher view of the universe or creating major disagreement between them some of anaximenes writings apparently survived the hellenistic age but no record of these documents currently exist much of his astronomical thought was based on anaximander though he altered anaximander astrological ideas to better fit his own philosophical views on physics and the natural world like others in his school of thought anaximenes practiced material monism this tendency to identify one specific underlying reality made up of material thing is what he is principally remembered for today apollodorus of damascus noted the dates anaximander was alive in relation to well known historical events and estimated anaximenes lifespan as having occurred during the same time period in which cyrus the great defeated croesus at the battle of thymbra in bc anaximenes was the last known milesian philosopher as miletus was captured by the persian army in bc anaximenes and the arche while his predecessors thales and anaximander proposed that the archai singular arche meaning the underlying material of the world were water and the ambiguous substance apeiron respectively anaximenes asserted that aer mist vapor air was this primary substance of which all natural things are made by rejecting his teacher theory based on the concept of discontinuity anaximenes took more empirical approach to understanding the underlying processes of genesis and change on two assumptions origination retains properties of the apeiron but it has an actually tangible state of existence as air that can evolve other substances and genesis and change depend on cohesive mechanistic process known as condensation and rarefaction anaximenes believed that air was infinite and divine he was the first to use the word pneuma breath of life as synonym for air one of the only surviving quotes by anaximenes reads just as our soul being air holds us together so pneuma and air encompass and guard the whole world the analogy compared atmospheric air as the divine and human air as souls that animate people this relation of the macroscopic and microscopic suggested anaximenes believed there was an overarching principle that regulated all life and behavior essentially he thought air was the primary substance that held the universe together interestingly the old testament features similar analogy to the founding of the world and creation of man but anaximenes did not recognize creator of the universe and did not think of the pneuma as creator to guide man the choice of air may seem arbitrary but anaximenes based his conclusion on naturally observable phenomena in the processes of rarefaction and condensation the primary difference in the forms of air as matter was the degree of condensation and density when air condenses it becomes visible and according to anaximenes the spread out invisible infinite air was condensed to wind then formed into clouds which condensed further to produce mist rain and other forms of precipitation as the condensed air cooled anaximenes supposed that earth itself was an early condensate of air the process continued until the air was condensed enough to form solids like the earth and ultimately stones by contrast anaximenes was able to visually see how water evaporates into air and based his concept of rarefaction on this observation according to him any object that held light was made of fire and fire was made from the rarefaction of air while other philosophers also recognized such transitions in states of matter anaximenes was the first to associate the qualitative change in hot dry and cold wet pairings with the density of single material effectively adding quantitative dimension to the milesian monistic system he attributed condensation to cold wet air and rarefaction to the interaction of hot dry air this concept was the foundation for understanding the existence of different substances materials and elements due to their arrangement of atoms and number of subatomic particles influence on philosophy since language and communication were very limited in his time anaximenes analogies were key in explaining the uncertain through the certain for example he knew for certain that blowing air on his hand with his mouth wide open produced hot air while blowing on his hand with half closed lips produced cold air these observations were key in his postulate that the hot air was due to rarefaction and expansion whereas the cold air was due to condensation and compression although in modern times it is known that this is actually the opposite anaximenes was key in arriving at this conclusion his analogies often connected parallels between man and the cosmos insinuating that the same natural laws observable on earth applied to the heavens over years later isaac newton proved this to be true throughout history anaximenes observations proved helpful to uncover powerful theories such as quantum physics and chemical properties by the end of the milesian philosophy era there were many questions left unanswered this sparked the stimulation of pre socratic thought to continue through many other notable philosophers such as pythagoras parmenides heraclitus and democritus anaximenes greatest influence is not from his theories of matter but instead it is from how he thought about these ideas for instance his theory of air being the underlying substance was disproved but when looking at his idea from fundamental aspect in which substance is capable of changing forms his theory was the first of its kind this concept of changing of forms is fundamental to scientific
