by rumors that he and salieri had been bitter rivals and that salieri had poisoned the younger composer yet this has been proven false and it is likely that they were at least mutually respectful peers life and career salieri started his musical studies in his native town of legnago he was first taught at home by his older brother francesco salieri former student of the violinist and composer giuseppe tartini and he received further lessons from the organist of the legnago cathedral giuseppe simoni pupil of padre giovanni battista martini salieri remembered little from his childhood in
