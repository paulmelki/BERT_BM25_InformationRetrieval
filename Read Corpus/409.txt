general structure of an amide specifically carboxamide formamide the simplest amide asparagine an amino acid with side chain highlighted containing an amide group in organic chemistry an amide also known as an organic amide or carboxamide is compound with the general formula rc nr where and represent organic groups or hydrogen atoms the amide group is called peptide bond when it is part of the main chain of protein and isopeptide bond when it occurs in side chain such as in the amino acids asparagine and glutamine it can be viewed as derivative of carboxylic acid rc oh with the hydroxyl group oh replaced by an amine group nr or equivalently an acyl alkanoyl group rc joined to an amine group common examples of amides are acetamide conh benzamide conh and hcon ch amides are qualified as primary secondary and tertiary according to whether the amine subgroup has the form nh nhr or nrr where and are groups other than hydrogen the core of amides is called the amide group specifically carboxamide group amides are pervasive in nature and technology proteins and important plastics like nylons aramid twaron and kevlar are polymers whose units are connected by amide groups polyamides these linkages are easily formed confer structural rigidity and resist hydrolysis amides include many other important biological compounds as well as many drugs like paracetamol penicillin and lsd low molecular weight amides such as are common solvents nomenclature in the usual nomenclature one adds the term amide to the stem of the parent acid name for instance the amide derived from acetic acid is named acetamide ch conh iupac recommends ethanamide but this and related formal names are rarely encountered when the amide is derived from primary or secondary amine the substituents on nitrogen are indicated first in the name thus the amide formed from dimethylamine and acetic acid is ch conme where me ch usually even this name is simplified to cyclic amides are called lactams they are necessarily secondary or tertiary amides pronunciation the term amide is variously pronounced or or different pronunciations may be used for the two main senses saying for the carbonyl nitrogen compound and for the anion others replace one of these with properties bonding molecular orbitals gray the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom is delocalized into the carbonyl group thus forming partial double bond between nitrogen and carbon in fact the and atoms have molecular orbitals occupied by delocalized electrons forming conjugated system consequently the three bonds of the nitrogen in amides is not pyramidal as in the amines but planar the structure of an amide can be described also as resonance between two alternative structures px it is estimated that for acetamide structure makes contribution to the structure while structure makes contribution these figures do not sum to because there are additional less important resonance forms that are not depicted above there is also hydrogen bond present between the active groups hydrogen and nitrogen atoms resonance is largely prevented in the very strained quinuclidone basicity compared to amines amides are very weak bases while the conjugate acid of an amine has of about the conjugate acid of an amide has around therefore amides don have as clearly noticeable acid base properties in water this relative lack of basicity is explained by the withdrawing of electrons from the amine by the carbonyl on the other hand amides are much stronger bases than carboxylic acids esters aldehydes and ketones their conjugate acids as are between and the proton of primary or secondary amide does not dissociate readily under normal conditions its is usually well above conversely under extremely acidic conditions the carbonyl oxygen can become protonated with of roughly it is not only because of the positive charge on the nitrogen but also because of the negative charge on the oxygen gained through resonance hydrogen bonding and solubility because of the greater of oxygen the carbonyl is stronger dipole than the dipole the presence of dipole and to lesser extent dipole allows amides to act as bond acceptors in primary and secondary amides the presence of dipoles allows amides to function as bond donors as well thus amides can participate in hydrogen bonding with water and other protic solvents the oxygen atom can accept hydrogen bonds from water and the hydrogen atoms can donate bonds as result of interactions such as these the water solubility of amides is greater than that of corresponding hydrocarbons these hydrogen bonds are also have an important role in the secondary structure of proteins the solubilities of amides and esters are roughly comparable typically amides are less soluble than comparable amines and carboxylic acids since these compounds can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds tertiary amides with the important exception of exhibit low solubility in water the presence of the amide group is generally easily established at least in small molecules it can be distinguished from nitro and cyano groups in ir spectra amides exhibit moderately intense co band near cm by nmr spectroscopy con signals occur at low fields in ray crystallography the center together with the three immediately adjacent atoms define plane reactions mechanism for acid mediated hydrolysis of an amide amides undergo many chemical reactions although they are less reactive than esters amides hydrolyse in hot alkali as well as in strong acidic conditions acidic conditions yield the carboxylic acid and the ammonium ion while basic hydrolysis yield the carboxylate ion and ammonia the protonation of the initially generated amine under acidic conditions and the deprotonation of the initially generated carboxylic acid under basic conditions render these processes non catalytic and irreversible amides are also versatile precursors to many other functional groups electrophiles react with the carbonyl oxygen this step often precedes hydrolysis which is catalyzed by both br√∏nsted acids and lewis acids enzymes peptidases and artificial catalysts are known to accelerate the
