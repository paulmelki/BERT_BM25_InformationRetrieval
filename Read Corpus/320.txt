the meaning of the word american in the english language varies according to the historical geographical and political context in which it is used american is derived from america term originally denoting all of the new world also called the americas in some expressions it retains this pan american sense but its usage has evolved over time and for various historical reasons the word came to denote people or things specifically from the united states of america in modern english american generally refers to persons or things related to the united states of america among native english speakers this usage is almost universal with any other use of the term requiring specification however this usage is seen by some as semantic by those who argue that american should be widened in english to also include people or things from anywhere in the american continents the word can be used as either an adjective or noun viz demonym in adjectival use it means of or relating to the united states for example elvis presley was an american singer or the man prefers american english in its noun form the word generally means resident or citizen of the us but is also used for someone whose ethnic identity is simply american euro american the noun is rarely used in english to refer to people not connected to the united states when intending geographical meaning when used with grammatical qualifier the adjective american can mean of or relating to the americas as in latin american or indigenous american less frequently the adjective can take this meaning without qualifier as in american spanish dialects and pronunciation differ by country or the name of the organization of american states third use of the term pertains specifically to the indigenous peoples of the americas for instance in the th century many americans died from imported diseases during the european conquest though this usage is rare as indigenous first nations or amerindian are considered less confusing and generally more appropriate compound constructions which indicate minority ethnic group such as african americans likewise refer exclusively to people in or from the united states of america as does the prefix americo for instance the americo liberians and their language merico derive their name from the fact that they are descended from african american settlers blacks who were formerly enslaved in the united states of america other languages french german italian japanese hebrew arabic and russian speakers may use cognates of american to refer to inhabitants of the americas or to nationals they generally have other terms specific to nationals such as the german french japanese and italian these specific terms may be less common than the term american in french or from united states of america is rarely used word that distinguishes things and persons from the adjective which denotes persons and things from the united states but may also refer to the americas likewise german use of and observe said cultural distinction solely denoting things and people note that in normal parlance the adjective american and its direct cognates are usually used if the context renders the nationality of the person clear this differentiation is prevalent in german speaking countries as indicated by the style manual of the neue zürcher zeitung one of the leading german language newspapers in switzerland which dismisses the term as both unnecessary and artificial and recommends replacing it with amerikanisch the respective guidelines of the foreign ministries of austria germany and switzerland all prescribe amerikaner and amerikanisch in reference to the united states for official usage making no mention of or portuguese has denoting both person or thing from the americas and national for referring specifically to national and things some words used are also spelled united states person from and yankee both usages exist in brazil but are uncommon in portugal but the term most often used and the only one in portugal is even though it could as with its spanish equivalent apply to canadians mexicans etc as well in spanish denotes geographic and cultural origin in the new world as well as infrequently citizen the more common term is united states person which derives from united states of america the spanish term north american is frequently used to refer things and persons from the united states but this term can also denote people and things from canada and mexico among spanish speakers north america generally doesn include central america or the caribbean in other languages however there is no possibility for confusion for example the chinese word for national is is derived from word for the united states where is an abbreviation for yàměilìjiā america and is country the name for the american continents is from plus continent thus is an american in the continent sense and is an american in the sense conversely in czech there is no possibility for disambiguation američan and američanka can refer to persons from the united states or from the continents of the americas and there is no specific word capable of distinguishing the two meanings for this reason the latter meaning is very rarely used and word is used almost exclusively to refer to persons from the united states the usage is exactly parallel to the english word korean and vietnamese also use unambiguous terms with korean having for the country versus for the continents and vietnamese having for the country versus for the continents japanese has such terms as well versus but they are found more in newspaper headlines than in speech where predominates in swahili means specifically the united states and is national whereas the international form refers to the continents and would be an inhabitant thereof likewise the esperanto word refers to the continents for the country there is the term thus citizen of the united states is an whereas an is an inhabitant of the americas in hungarian the term amerikai american refers to person or thing from the united states history america is named after italian explorer amerigo
