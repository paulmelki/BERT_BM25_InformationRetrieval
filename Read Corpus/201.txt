cholera epidemic that killed large proportion of oran population in but situated the novel in the oran and its surroundings were struck by disease several times before camus published his novel according to an academic study oran was decimated by the bubonic plague in and but all later outbreaks in cases cases and cases were very far from the scale of the epidemic described in the novel the plague is considered an existentialist classic despite camus objection to the label the novel stresses the powerlessness of the individual characters to affect their destinies the very pith of absurdism the narrative tone is similar to kafka especially in the trial whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings the material often pointedly resonating as stark allegory of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition major characters dr bernard rieux dr bernard rieux is described as man about age of moderate height dark skinned with close cropped black hair at the beginning of the novel rieux wife who has been ill for year leaves for sanatorium it is rieux who treats the first victim of plague and first uses the word plague to describe the disease he urges the

of the situation within short while he grasps what is at stake and warns the authorities that unless steps are taken immediately the epidemic could kill off half the town population of two hundred thousand within couple of months during the epidemic rieux heads an auxiliary hospital and works long hours treating the victims he injects serum and lances the abscesses but there is little more that he can do and his duties weigh heavily upon him he never gets home until late and he has to distance himself from the natural pity that he feels for the victims otherwise he would not be able to go on it is especially hard for him when he visits victim in the person home because he knows that he must immediately call for an ambulance and have the person removed from the house often the relatives plead with him not to do so since they know they may never see the person again rieux works to combat the plague simply because he is doctor and his job is to relieve human suffering he does not do it for any grand religious purpose like paneloux rieux does not believe in god or as part of high minded moral code like tarrou he is practical man doing what needs to be done without any fuss but he
