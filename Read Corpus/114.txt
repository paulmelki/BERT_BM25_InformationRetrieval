asparagales asparagoid lilies is an order of plants in modern classification systems such as the angiosperm phylogeny group apg and the angiosperm phylogeny web the order takes its name from the type family asparagaceae and is placed in the monocots amongst the lilioid monocots the order has only recently been recognized in classification systems it was first put forward by huber in and later taken up in the dahlgren system of and then the apg in and before this many of its families were assigned to the old order liliales very large order containing almost all monocots with colorful tepals and lacking starch in their endosperm dna sequence analysis indicated that many of the taxa previously included in liliales should actually be redistributed over three orders liliales asparagales and dioscoreales the boundaries of the asparagales and of its families have undergone series of changes in recent years future research may lead to further changes and ultimately greater stability in the apg circumscription asparagales is the largest order of monocots with families genera and about species the order is clearly circumscribed on the basis of molecular phylogenetics but it is difficult to define morphologically since its members are structurally diverse most species of asparagales are herbaceous perennials although some are climbers and some are tree like the order also contains many geophytes bulbs corms and various kinds of tuber according to telomere sequence at least two evolutionary switch points happened within the order the basal sequence is formed by tttaggg like in the majority of higher plants basal motif was changed to vertebrate like ttaggg and finally the most divergent motif ctcggttatggg appears in allium one of the defining characteristics synapomorphies of the order is the presence of phytomelanin black pigment present in the seed coat creating dark crust phytomelanin is found in most families of the asparagales although not in orchidaceae thought to be the sister group of the rest of the order the leaves of almost all species form tight rosette either at the base of the plant or at the end of the stem but occasionally along the stem the flowers are not particularly distinctive being lily type with six tepals and up to six stamina the order is thought to have first diverged from other related monocots some million years ago early in the cretaceous period although given the difficulty in classifying the families involved estimates are likely to be uncertain from an economic point of view the order asparagales is second in importance within the monocots to the order poales which includes grasses and cereals species are used as food and flavourings onion garlic leek asparagus vanilla saffron in medicinal or cosmetic applications aloe as cut flowers freesia gladiolus iris orchids and as garden ornamentals day lilies lily of the valley agapanthus description seeds of hippeastrum with dark phytomelan containing coat habit created by secondary thickening in nolina recurvata although most species in the order are herbaceous some no more than cm high there are number of climbers some species of asparagus as well as several genera forming trees agave cordyline yucca dracaena aloe which can exceed in height succulent genera occur in several families aloe almost all species have tight cluster of leaves rosette either at the base of the plant or at the end of more or less woody stem as with yucca in some cases the leaves are produced along the stem the flowers are in the main not particularly distinctive being of general lily type with six tepals either free or fused from the base and up to six stamina they are frequently clustered at the end of the plant stem the asparagales are generally distinguished from the liliales by the lack of markings on the tepals the presence of septal nectaries in the ovaries rather than the bases of the tepals or stamen filaments and the presence of secondary growth they are generally geophytes but with linear leaves and lack of fine reticular venation the seeds have the external epidermis either obliterated in most species bearing fleshy fruit or if present have layer of black carbonaceous phytomelanin in species with dry fruits nuts the inner part of the seed coat is generally collapsed in contrast to liliales whose seeds have well developed outer epidermis lack phytomelanin and usually display cellular inner layer the orders which have been separated from the old liliales are difficult to characterize no single morphological character appears to be diagnostic of the order asparagales the flowers of asparagales are of general type among the lilioid monocots compared to liliales they usually have plain tepals without markings in the form of dots if nectaries are present they are in the septa of the ovaries rather than at the base of the tepals or stamens those species which have relatively large dry seeds have dark crust like crustose outer layer containing the pigment phytomelan however some species with hairy seeds eriospermum family asparagaceae berries maianthemum family asparagaceae or highly reduced seeds orchids lack this dark pigment in their seed coats phytomelan is not unique to asparagales it is not synapomorphy but it is common within the order and rare outside it the inner portion of the seed coat is usually completely collapsed in contrast the morphologically similar seeds of liliales have no phytomelan and usually retain cellular structure in the inner portion of the seed coat most monocots are unable to thicken their stems once they have formed since they lack the cylindrical meristem present in other angiosperm groups asparagales have method of secondary thickening which is otherwise only found in dioscorea in the order disoscoreales in process called anomalous secondary growth they are able to create new vascular bundles around which thickening growth occurs agave yucca aloe dracaena nolina and cordyline can become massive trees albeit not of the height of the tallest dicots and with less branching other genera in the order such as lomandra and aphyllanthes have the same type of secondary growth but confined to
