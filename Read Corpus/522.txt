doukas and secondly to nikephoros iii botaneiates she was preoccupied with the future of her son by michael vii constantine doukas nikephoros iii intended to leave the throne to one of his close relatives and this resulted in maria ambivalence and alliance with the komnenoi though the real driving force behind this political alliance was anna dalassene the empress was already closely connected to the komnenoi through maria cousin irene marriage to isaac komnenos so the komnenoi brothers were able to see her under the pretense of friendly family visit furthermore to aid the conspiracy maria had adopted alexios as her son though she was only five years older than he maria was persuaded to do so on the advice of her own alans and her eunuchs who had been instigated by

outer and inner sanctuary of the church the women pretended to the gatekeepers that they were pilgrims from cappadocia who had spent all their funds and wanted to worship before starting their return trip however before they were to gain entry into the sanctuary straboromanos and royal guards caught up with them to summon them back to the palace anna then protested that the family was in fear for their lives her sons were loyal subjects alexios and isaac were discovered absent without leave and had learned of plot by enemies of the komnenoi to have them both blinded and had therefore fled the capital so they may continue to be of loyal service to the emperor she refused to go with them and demanded that they allow her to pray to the mother of god for protection this request was granted and anna then manifested her true theatrical and manipulative capabilities alexios manuscript illustration nikephoros iii botaneiates was forced into public vow that he would grant protection to the family straboromanos tried to give anna his cross but for her it was not sufficiently large enough for all bystanders to witness the oath she also demanded that the cross be personally sent by
