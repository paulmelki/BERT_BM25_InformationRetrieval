apiaceae or umbelliferae is family of mostly aromatic flowering plants named after the type genus apium and commonly known as the celery carrot or parsley family or simply as umbellifers it is the th largest family of flowering plants with more than species in genera including such well known and economically important plants such as ajwain angelica anise asafoetida caraway carrot celery chervil coriander cumin dill fennel lovage cow parsley parsley parsnip and sea holly as well as silphium plant whose identity is unclear and which may be extinct the family apiaceae includes significant number of phototoxic species such as giant hogweed and smaller number of highly poisonous species such as water hemlock poison hemlock water dropwort and spotted cowbane description most apiaceae are annual biennial or perennial herbs frequently with the leaves aggregated toward the base though minority are woody shrubs or small trees such as bupleurum fruticosum their leaves are of variable size and alternately arranged or with the upper leaves becoming nearly opposite the leaves may be petiolate or sessile there are no stipules but the petioles are frequently sheathing and the leaves may be perfoliate the leaf blade is usually dissected ternate or pinnatifid but simple and entire in some genera bupleurum commonly their leaves emit marked smell when crushed aromatic to foetid but absent in some species the defining characteristic of this family is the inflorescence the flowers nearly always aggregated in terminal umbels that may be simple or more commonly compound often umbelliform cymes the flowers are usually perfect hermaphroditic and actinomorphic but there may be zygomorphic flowers at the edge of the umbel as in carrot daucus carota and coriander with petals of unequal size the ones pointing outward from the umbel larger than the ones pointing inward some are andromonoecious or even dioecious as in acronema with distinct calyx and corolla but the calyx is often highly reduced to the point of being undetectable in many species while the corolla can be white yellow pink or purple the flowers are nearly perfectly pentamerous with five petals sepals and stamens the androecium consists of five stamens but there is often variation in the functionality of the stamens even within single inflorescence some flowers are functionally staminate where pistil may be present but has no ovules capable of being fertilized while others are functionally pistillate where stamens are present but their anthers do not produce viable pollen pollination of one flower by the pollen of different flower of the same plant geitonogamy is common the gynoecium consists of two carpels fused into single bicarpellate pistil with an inferior ovary stylopodia support two styles and secrete nectar attracting pollinators like flies mosquitoes gnats beetles moths and bees the fruit is schizocarp consisting of two fused carpels that separate at maturity into two mericarps each containing single seed the fruits of many species are dispersed by wind but others such as those of daucus spp are covered in bristles which may be hooked in sanicle sanicula europaea and thus catch in the fur of animals the seeds have an oily endosperm and often contain essential oils containing aromatic compounds that are responsible for the flavour of commercially important umbelliferous seed such as anise cumin and coriander the shape and details of the ornamentation of the ripe fruits are important for identification to species level taxonomy apiaceae was first described by john lindley in the name is derived from the type genus apium which was originally used by pliny the elder circa ad for celery like plant the alternative name for the family umbelliferae derives from the inflorescence being generally in the form of compound umbel the family was one of the first to be recognized as distinct group in jacques daleschamps historia generalis plantarum with robert morison plantarum umbelliferarum distribution nova it became the first group of plants for which systematic study was published the family is solidly placed within the apiales order in the apg iii system it is closely related to araliaceae and the boundaries between these families remain unclear traditionally groups within the family have been delimited largely based on fruit morphology and the results from this have not been congruent with the more recent molecular phylogenetic analyses the subfamilial and tribal classification for the family is currently in state of flux with many of the groups being found to be grossly paraphyletic or polyphyletic genera according to the angiosperm phylogeny website genera are in the family apiaceae file s_medizinal pflanzen jpg chaerophyllum bulbosum file

found eating mildew on these shrubs uses many members of this family are cultivated for various purposes parsnip pastinaca sativa carrot daucus carota and hamburg parsley petroselinum crispum produce tap roots that are large enough to be useful as food many species produce essential oils in their leaves or fruits and as result are flavourful aromatic herbs examples are parsley petroselinum crispum coriander coriandrum sativum culantro and dill anethum graveolens the seeds may be used in cuisine as with coriander coriandrum sativum fennel foeniculum vulgare cumin cuminum cyminum and caraway carum carvi other notable cultivated apiaceae include chervil anthriscus cerefolium angelica angelica spp celery apium graveolens arracacha arracacia xanthorrhiza sea holly eryngium spp asafoetida ferula asafoetida galbanum ferula gummosa cicely myrrhis odorata anise pimpinella anisum lovage levisticum officinale and hacquetia hacquetia epipactis cultivation generally all members of this family are best cultivated in the cool season garden indeed they may not grow at all if the soils are too warm almost every widely cultivated plant of this group is considered useful as companion plant one reason is because the tiny flowers clustered into umbels are well suited for ladybugs parasitic wasps and predatory
