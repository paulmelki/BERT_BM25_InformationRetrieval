modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people from being burthen to their parents or country and for making them beneficial to the publick commonly referred to as modest proposal is juvenalian satirical essay written and published anonymously by jonathan swift in the essay suggests that the impoverished irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food to rich gentlemen and ladies this satirical hyperbole mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor as well as british policy toward the irish in general in english writing the phrase modest proposal is now conventionally an allusion to this style of straight faced satire synopsis swift essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the english language much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in ireland so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of swift solution when he states young healthy child well nursed is at year old most delicious nourishing and wholesome food whether stewed roasted baked or boiled and make no doubt that it will equally serve in fricassee or ragout swift goes to great lengths to support his argument including list of possible preparation styles for the children and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion he uses methods of argument throughout his essay which lampoon the then influential william petty and the social engineering popular among followers of francis bacon these lampoons include appealing to the authority of very knowing american of my acquaintance in london and the famous psalmanazar native of the island formosa who had already confessed to not being from formosa in in the tradition of roman satire swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by paralipsis population solutions george wittkowsky argued that swift main target in modest proposal was not the conditions in ireland but rather the can do spirit of the times that led people to devise number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills swift was especially attacking projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with simple cure all solution memorable example of these sorts of schemes involved the idea of running the poor through joint stock company in response swift modest proposal was burlesque of projects concerning the poor that were in vogue during the early th century modest proposal also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects the pamphlet targets reformers who regard people as commodities in the piece swift adopts the technique of political arithmetician to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics critics differ about swift intentions in using this faux mathematical philosophy edmund wilson argues that statistically the logic of the modest proposal can be compared with defence of crime arrogated to marx in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population wittkowsky counters that swift satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that springs from spirit of bitter mockery not from the delight in calculations for their own sake rhetoric charles smith argues that swift rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the irish swift specific strategy is twofold using trap to create sympathy for the irish and dislike of the narrator who in the span of one sentence details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty but feels emotion solely for members of his own class swift use of gripping details of poverty and his narrator cool approach towards them create two opposing points of view that alienate the reader perhaps unconsciously from narrator who can view with melancholy detachment subject that swift has directed us rhetorically to see in much less detached way swift has his proposer further degrade the irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals lewis argues that the speaker uses the vocabulary of animal husbandry to describe the irish once the children have been commodified swift rhetoric can easily turn people into animals then meat and from meat logically into tonnage worth price per pound swift uses the proposer serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal in making his argument the speaker uses the conventional textbook approved order of argument from swift time which was derived from the latin rhetorician quintilian the contrast between the careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme and the ridiculousness of the proposal create situation in which the reader has to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such diligent thoughtful and conventional man to propose so perverse plan influences scholars have speculated about which earlier works swift may have had in mind when he wrote modest proposal tertullian apology james william johnson argues that modest proposal was largely influenced and inspired by tertullian apology satirical attack against early roman persecution of christianity johnson believes that swift saw major similarities between the two situations johnson notes swift obvious affinity for tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works modest proposal and apology in structure johnson points out the same central theme that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument that human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human stylistically swift and tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language in agreement with johnson donald baker points out the similarity between both authors tones and use of irony baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic justification by ownership over the subject of sacrificing children tertullian while attacking pagan parents and swift while attacking the english mistreatment of the irish poor defoe the generous projector it has also been argued that modest proposal was at least in part response to the essay the generous projector or friendly proposal to prevent
