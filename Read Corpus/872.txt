armenian classical reformed is an independent branch of the indo european language of which it is the only language it is the official language of armenia historically being spoken throughout the armenian highlands today armenian is widely spoken throughout the armenian diaspora armenian is written in its own writing system the armenian alphabet introduced in ad by the priest mesrop mashtots history classification and origins irina speaker of the artsakh dialect of armenian armenian is an independent branch of the indo european languages it is of interest to linguists for its distinctive phonological developments within that family armenian exhibits more satemization than centumization although it is not classified as belonging to either of these subgroups some linguists tentatively conclude that armenian greek and phrygian and indo iranian were dialectally close to each other within this hypothetical dialect group proto armenian was situated between proto greek centum subgroup and proto indo iranian satem subgroup ronald kim has noted unique morphological developments connecting armenian to balto slavic languages armenia was monolingual country by the nd century bc at the latest its language has long literary history with th century bible translation as its oldest surviving text its vocabulary has historically been influenced by western middle iranian languages particularly parthian and to lesser extent by greek persian and syriac there are two standardized modern literary forms eastern armenian and western armenian with which most contemporary dialects are mutually intelligible although armenians were known to history much earlier for example they were mentioned in the th century bc behistun inscription and in xenophon th century bc history the anabasis the oldest surviving armenian language text is the th century ad bible translation of mesrop mashtots who created the armenian alphabet in at which time it had letters he is also credited by some with the creation of the georgian alphabet and the caucasian albanian alphabet while armenian constitutes the sole member of the armenian branch of the indo european family aram kossian has suggested that the hypothetical mushki language may have been now extinct armenic language early contacts austin concluded that there was early contact between armenian and anatolian languages based on what he considered common archaisms such as the lack of feminine gender and the absence of inherited long vowels however unlike shared innovations or synapomorphies the common retention of archaisms or symplesiomorphy is not considered conclusive evidence of period of common isolated development there are words used in armenian that are generally believed to have been borrowed from anatolian languages particularly from luwian although some researchers have identified possible hittite loanwords as well in soviet linguist igor diakonoff noted the presence in classical armenian of what he calls caucasian substratum identified by earlier scholars consisting of loans from the kartvelian and northeast caucasian languages noting that hurro urartian speaking peoples inhabited the armenian homeland in the second millennium bc diakonoff identifies in armenian hurro urartian substratum of social cultural and animal and plant terms such as ałaxin slave girl hurr al ḫḫenne cov sea urart ṣûǝ inland sea ułt camel hurr uḷtu and xnjor apple tree hurr ḫinzuri some of the terms he gives admittedly have an akkadian or sumerian provenance but he suggests they were borrowed through hurrian or urartian given that these borrowings do not undergo sound changes characteristic of the development of armenian from proto indo european he dates their borrowing to time before the written record but after the proto armenian language stage loan words from iranian languages along with the other ancient accounts such as that of xenophon above initially led linguists to erroneously classify armenian as an iranian language scholars such as paul de lagarde and müller believed that the similarities between the two languages meant that armenian belonged to the iranian language family the distinctness of armenian was recognized when philologist heinrich hübschmann used the comparative method to distinguish two layers of iranian words from the older armenian vocabulary he showed that armenian often had morphemes for the one concept and the non iranian components yielded consistent pie pattern distinct from iranian and also demonstrated that the inflectional morphology was different from that in iranian languages graeco armenian hypothesis the hypothesis that greek is armenian closest living relative originates with holger pedersen who noted that the number of greek armenian lexical cognates is greater than that of agreements between armenian and any other indo european language antoine meillet further investigated morphological and phonological agreement postulating that the parent languages of greek and armenian were dialects in immediate geographical proximity in the proto indo european period meillet hypothesis became popular in the wake of his book esquisse une histoire de la langue latine georg renatus solta does not go as far as postulating proto graeco armenian stage but he concludes that considering both the lexicon and morphology greek is clearly the dialect most closely related to armenian eric hamp supports the graeco armenian thesis anticipating even time when we should speak of helleno armenian meaning the postulate of graeco armenian proto language armenian shares the augment and negator derived from the set phrase proto indo european language never anything or always nothing and the representation of word initial laryngeals by prothetic vowels and other phonological and morphological peculiarities with greek nevertheless as fortson comments by the time we reach our earliest armenian records in the th century ad the evidence of any such early kinship has been reduced to few tantalizing pieces greco armeno aryan hypothesis graeco armeno aryan is hypothetical clade within the indo european family ancestral to the greek language the armenian language and the indo iranian languages graeco aryan unity would have become divided into proto greek and proto indo iranian by the mid third millennium bc conceivably proto armenian would have been located between proto greek and proto indo iranian consistent with the fact that armenian shares certain features only with indo iranian the satem change but others only with greek graeco aryan has comparatively wide support among indo europeanists who believe
