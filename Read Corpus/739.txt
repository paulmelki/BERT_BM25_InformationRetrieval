enacting series of punitive laws which effectively rescinded massachusetts bay colony rights of self government the other colonies rallied behind massachusetts and group of american patriot leaders

as early as the english government had sought to regulate trade in the american colonies and parliament passed the navigation acts on october to provide the plantation colonies of the south with profitable export market the acts prohibited british producers from growing tobacco and also encouraged shipbuilding particularly in the new england colonies some argue that the economic impact was minimal on the colonists but the political friction which the acts triggered was more serious as the merchants most directly affected were also the most politically active king philip war ended in which the new england colonies fought without any military assistance from england and this contributed to the development of unique identity separate from that of the british people but king charles ii determined to bring the new england colonies under more centralized administration in the to regulate trade to more effectively benefit the homeland the new england colonists fiercely opposed his efforts and the crown nullified their colonial charters in response charles successor james ii finalized these efforts in establishing the consolidated dominion of new england dominion rule triggered bitter resentment throughout new england the enforcement of the unpopular navigation acts and the curtailing of local democracy angered the colonists new englanders were encouraged however by change of government in england which saw james ii effectively abdicate and populist uprising in new england overthrew dominion rule on april
