illustration of electric charge of particles left and antiparticles right from top to bottom electron positron proton antiproton neutron antineutron in particle physics every type of particle is associated with an antiparticle with the same mass but with opposite physical charges such as electric charge for example the antiparticle of the electron is the antielectron which is often referred to as positron while the electron has negative electric charge the positron has positive electric charge and is produced naturally in certain types of radioactive decay the opposite is also true the antiparticle of the positron is the electron some particles such as the photon are their own antiparticle otherwise for each pair of antiparticle partners one is designated as the normal particle kind of all particles usually interacted with is made of and the other usually given the prefix anti as the antiparticle particle antiparticle pairs can annihilate each other producing photons since the charges of the particle and antiparticle are opposite total charge is conserved for example the positrons produced in natural radioactive decay quickly annihilate themselves with electrons producing pairs of gamma rays process exploited in positron emission tomography the laws of nature are very nearly symmetrical with respect to particles and antiparticles for example an antiproton and positron can form an antihydrogen atom which is believed to have the same properties as hydrogen atom this leads to the question of why the formation of matter after the big bang resulted in universe consisting almost entirely of matter rather than being half and half mixture of matter and antimatter the discovery of charge parity violation helped to shed light on this problem by showing that this symmetry originally thought to be perfect was only approximate because charge is conserved it is not possible to create an antiparticle without either destroying another particle of the same charge as is for instance the case when antiparticles are produced naturally via beta decay or the collision of cosmic rays with earth atmosphere or by the simultaneous creation of both particle and its antiparticle which can occur in particle accelerators such as the large hadron collider at cern although particles and their antiparticles have opposite charges electrically neutral particles need not be identical to their antiparticles the neutron for example is made out of quarks the antineutron from antiquarks and they are distinguishable from one another because neutrons and antineutrons annihilate each other upon contact however other neutral particles are their own antiparticles such as photons bosons mesons and hypothetical gravitons and some hypothetical wimps history experiment in soon after the prediction of positrons by paul dirac carl anderson found that cosmic ray collisions produced these particles in cloud chamber particle detector in which moving electrons or positrons leave behind trails as they move through the gas the electric charge to mass ratio of particle can be measured by observing the radius of curling of its cloud chamber track in magnetic field positrons because of the direction that their paths curled were at first mistaken for electrons travelling in the opposite direction positron paths in cloud chamber trace the same helical path as an electron but rotate in the opposite direction with respect to the magnetic field direction due to their having the same magnitude of charge to mass ratio but with opposite charge and therefore opposite signed charge to mass ratios the antiproton and antineutron were found by emilio segr√® and owen chamberlain in at the university of california berkeley since then the antiparticles of many other subatomic particles have been created in particle accelerator experiments in recent years complete atoms of antimatter have been assembled out of antiprotons and positrons collected in electromagnetic traps dirac hole theory solutions of the dirac equation contained negative energy quantum states as result an electron could always radiate energy and fall into negative energy state even worse it could keep radiating infinite amounts of energy because there were infinitely many negative energy states available to prevent this unphysical situation from happening dirac proposed that sea of negative energy electrons fills the universe already occupying all of the lower energy states so that due to the pauli exclusion principle no other electron could fall into them sometimes however one of these negative energy particles could be lifted out of this dirac sea to become positive energy particle but when lifted out it would leave behind hole in the sea that would act exactly like positive energy electron with reversed charge these holes were interpreted as negative energy electrons by paul dirac and by mistake he identified them with protons in his paper theory of electrons and protons however these negative energy electrons turned out to be positrons and not protons this picture implied an infinite negative charge for the universe problem of which dirac was aware dirac tried to argue that we would perceive this as the normal state of zero charge another difficulty was the difference in masses of the electron and the proton dirac tried to argue that this was due to the electromagnetic interactions with the sea until hermann weyl proved that hole theory was completely symmetric between negative and positive charges dirac also predicted reaction where an electron and proton annihilate to give two photons robert oppenheimer and igor tamm proved that this would cause ordinary matter to disappear too fast year later in dirac modified his theory and postulated the positron new particle of the same mass as the electron the discovery of this particle the next year removed the last two objections to his theory within dirac theory the problem of infinite charge of the universe remains some bosons also have antiparticles but since bosons do not obey the pauli exclusion principle only fermions do hole theory does not work for them unified interpretation of antiparticles is now available in quantum field theory which solves both these problems by describing antimatter as negative energy states of the same underlying matter field
