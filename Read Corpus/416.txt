letters sigma and xi in the latin transliteration the seven letters spelling its name may represent each of the seven classic planets the word may be related to abracadabra although other explanations exist there are similarities and differences between such figures in reports about basilides teaching ancient gnostic texts the larger greco roman magical traditions and modern magical and esoteric writings speculations have proliferated on abraxas in recent centuries who has been claimed to be both an egyptian god and demon etymology gaius julius hyginus fab gives abrax aslo therbeeo as names of horses of the sun mentioned by homerus the passage is miserably corrupt but it may not be accidental that the first three syllables make abraxas the proper form of the name is evidently abrasax as with the greek writers hippolytus epiphanias didymus de trin iii and theodoret also augustine and praedestinatus and in nearly all the legends on gems by probably euphonic inversion the translator of irenaeus and the other latin authors have abraxas which is found in the magical papyri and even though most sparingly on engraved stones the attempts to discover derivation for the name greek hebrew coptic or other have not been entirely successful egyptian claudius salmasius thought it egyptian but never gave the proofs which he promised bellermann thinks it compound of the egyptian words abrak and sax meaning the honorable and hallowed word or the word is adorable samuel sharpe finds in it an egyptian invocation to the godhead meaning hurt me not hebrew abraham geiger sees in it grecized

and final letters of the words the word abrakd pronounced abrakad with the meaning the host of the winged ones angels while this theory can explain the mystic word abracadabra the association of this phrase with abrasax is uncertain greek wendelin discovers compound of the initial letters amounting to in numerical value of four hebrew and three greek words all written with greek characters father son spirit holy salvation from the cross according to note of isaac de beausobre jean hardouin accepted the first three of these taking the four others for the initials of the greek anthrōpoussōzōn hagiōi xylōi saving mankind by the holy cross isaac de beausobre derives abraxas from the greek habros and saō the beautiful the glorious savior perhaps the word may be included among those mysterious expressions discussed by adolf von harnack which belong to no known speech and by their singular collocation of vowels and consonants give evidence that they belong to some mystic dialect or take their origin from some supposed divine inspiration the egyptian author of the book de mysteriis in reply to porphyry vii admits preference of barbarous to vernacular names in sacred things urging peculiar sanctity in the languages of certain nations as the egyptians and assyrians and origen contra cels refers to the potent names used by egyptian sages persian magi and indian brahmins signifying deities in the several languages sources it is uncertain what the actual role and function of abraxas was in the basilidian system as our authorities see below often show no direct
