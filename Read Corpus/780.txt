australia day speech to the search for new anthem referring to it as symbolic expression of our national pride and dignity the australia council for the arts organised the contest which was dubbed the australian national anthem quest the contest was held in two stages the first seeking lyrics and the second music each having prize for the winning entry on the recommendation of the council for the arts none of the new entries was felt worthy enough so the contest ended with suggestions for advance australia fair waltzing matilda and the song of australia in the whitlam government then performed
