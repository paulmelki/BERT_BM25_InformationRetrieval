soviet made zsu in california the zsu is the canonical modern spaag system an anti aircraft vehicle also known as self propelled anti aircraft gun spaag or self propelled air defense system spad is mobile vehicle with dedicated anti aircraft capability the russian equivalent of spaag is zsu for zenitnaya samokhodnaya ustanovka зенитная самоходная установка anti aircraft self propelled mount specific weapon systems used include machine guns autocannons larger guns or missiles and some mount both guns and longer ranged missiles the pantsir platforms used include both trucks and heavier combat vehicles such as apcs and tanks which add protection from aircraft artillery and small arms fire for front line deployment anti aircraft guns are usually mounted in quickly traversing turret with high rate of elevation for tracking fast moving aircraft they are often in dual or quadruple mounts allowing high rate of fire in addition most anti aircraft guns can be used in direct fire role against surface targets to great effect today missiles generally mounted on similar turrets have largely supplanted anti aircraft guns history world war british truck mounted qf inch gun world war anti aircraft machine guns have long been mounted on trucks and these were quite common during world war predecessor of the wwii german anti aircraft gun the wwi german mm anti aircraft gun was truck mounted and used to great effect against british tanks the british qf inch cwt was mounted on trucks for use on the western front inter war period between the two world wars the united kingdom developed the birch gun general purpose artillery piece on an armoured tracked chassis capable of maintaining formation with their current tanks over terrain the gun could be elevated for anti aircraft use vickers armstrong also developed spaag based on the chassis of the mk ton light tank dragon medium mark iv tractor mounting vickers qf pom pom gun of mm about were sold to siam and saw action as infantry support guns and aa guns during the franco thai war along with vickers mk type ton tanks this was probably the first tracked spaag manufactured in series later the british also developed version of the mk vi light tank armed with four machine guns that was known as light tank aa mk and also twin mm version based on the light tank mk was built among early pre war pioneers of self propelled aa guns were the germans by the time of the war they fielded the sd kfz and cargo halftracks mounting single mm or mm aa guns respectively later in the war similar german halftracks mounted quadruple mm weapons world war ii mm flakvierling quadmount on panzer iv chassis larger guns followed on larger trucks but these mountings generally required off truck setup in order to unlimber the stabilizing legs these guns needed one exception to this rule was the italian cannone da which was highly effective when mounted on trucks fit known as the autocannoni da the was feared weapon notably in the anti tank role but only few hundred had been produced by the time of the armistice in other nations tended to work on truck chassis starting in the british developed the en portee method of mounting an anti tank gun initially pounder on truck this was to prevent the weapon from being damaged by long distance towing across rough stony deserts and it was intended only to be carrying method with the gun unloaded for firing however crews tended to fire their weapons from their vehicles for the mobility this method provided with consequent casualties this undoubtedly inspired their morris officially the carrier sp mm aa bofors mm aa gun mounted on chassis derived from the morris quad field artillery tractor truck similar types based on ton lorries were produced in britain canada and australia and together formed the most numerous self propelled aa guns in british service the army brought truck towed bofors mm aa guns along with truck mounted units fitted with mechanized turrets when they sailed first for great britain and then onto france the turrets carried four inch mm machine guns which were designed to be adjusted to converge at the single point where enemy aircraft were expected to appear at low altitude in conduction of strafing runs directed at large infantry and field artillery units interest in mobile aa turned to heavier vehicles with the mass and stability needed to easily train weapons of all sizes probably the desire particularly in german service for anti aircraft vehicles to be armoured for their own protection also assisted this trend the concept of an armored spaag was pioneered by hungary during world war ii by producing the nimrod based on the anti ii license acquired from sweden germany followed later with their flakpanzer series german world war ii spaags include the möbelwagen wirbelwind ostwind and kugelblitz other forces followed with designs of their own notably the american created by mounting quadruple hb browning machine guns on half track the british developed their own spaags throughout the war mounting multiple machine guns and light cannon on various tank and armoured car chassis and by the crusader aa tanks which mounted the bofors mm gun or two three oerlikon mm cannon although used during the normandy landings by that point german aircraft were contained by the allies own air forces and they were largely unneeded cold war and later czechoslovak self propelled anti aircraft gun praga developed in the late flakpanzer gepard combining radars fire control and two mm guns in new turret mounted on leopard chassis typical of more modern designs the tunguska mounts both missiles and cannons the introduction of jet engines and the subsequent rough doubling of aircraft speeds greatly reduced the effectiveness of the spaag against attack aircraft typical spaag round might have muzzle velocity on the order of and might take as long as two to three seconds to reach target at its maximum range an aircraft flying at is moving
