arāmāyā in syriac esṭrangelā script syriac aramaic alphabet aramaic arāmāyā old aramaic imperial aramaic square script classical syriac is language that originated among ancient arameans at the beginning of the st millennium bc and later became one of the most prominent languages of the ancient near east during its three thousand years long history aramaic went through several stages of development it has served as language of public life and administration of ancient kingdoms and empires and also as language of divine worship and religious study it subsequently branched into several neo aramaic languages that are still spoken in modern times aramaic language belongs to the northwest semitic group of the afroasiatic language family which also includes the canaanite languages such as hebrew edomite moabite and phoenician as well as amorite and ugaritic the aramaic alphabet was widely adopted for other languages and is ancestral to the hebrew syriac and arabic alphabets historically and originally aramaic was the language of the arameans semitic speaking people of the region between the northern levant and the northern tigris valley by around bc the arameans had string of kingdoms in what is now part of syria jordan and the fringes of southern mesopotamia and anatolia aramaic rose to prominence under the neo assyrian empire bc under whose influence aramaic became prestige language after being adopted as lingua franca of the empire and its use spread throughout mesopotamia the levant and parts of asia minor at its height aramaic having gradually replaced earlier semitic languages was spoken in several variants all over what is today iraq syria lebanon palestine israel jordan kuwait eastern arabia bahrain sinai parts of southeast and south central turkey and parts of northwest iran aramaic was the language of jesus who spoke the galilean dialect during his public ministry as well as the language of large sections of the biblical books of daniel and ezra and also one of the languages of the talmud the scribes of the neo assyrian bureaucracy had also used aramaic and this practice was subsequently inherited by the succeeding neo babylonian empire bc and later by the achaemenid empire bc mediated by scribes that had been trained in the language highly standardized written aramaic named by scholars as imperial aramaic progressively also become the lingua franca of public life trade and commerce throughout the achaemenid territories wide use of written aramaic subsequently led to the adoption of the aramaic alphabet and as logograms some aramaic vocabulary in the pahlavi scripts which were used by several middle iranian languages including parthian middle persian sogdian and khwarazmian aramaic long history and diverse and widespread use has led to the development of many divergent varieties which are sometimes considered dialects though they have become distinct enough over time that they are now sometimes considered separate languages therefore there is not one singular static aramaic language each time and place rather has had its own variation the more widely spoken eastern aramaic and mandaic forms are today largely restricted to assyrian christian and mandean gnostic communities in iraq northeastern syria northwestern iran and southeastern turkey whilst the severely endangered western neo aramaic is spoken by small communities of arameans in northwestern syria some variants of aramaic are also retained as sacred languages by certain religious communities most notable among them is classical syriac the liturgical language of syriac christianity it is used by several communities including the assyrian church of the east the ancient church of the east the chaldean catholic church the syriac orthodox church the syriac catholic church the maronite church and also the saint thomas christian denominations of india one of aramaic liturgical dialects was mandaic which besides becoming vernacular neo mandaic also remained the liturgical language of mandaeism syriac was also the liturgical language of several now extinct gnostic faiths such as manichaeism neo aramaic languages are still spoken today as first language by many communities of syriac christians jews in particular the kurdish jews and mandaeans of the near east most numerously by christian syriacs syriac speakers ethnic arameans assyrians and chaldeans and with numbers of fluent speakers ranging approximately from million to million with the main languages among assyrians being assyrian neo aramaic speakers chaldean neo aramaic speakers and turoyo speakers together with number of smaller closely related languages with no more than to speakers between them they have retained use of the once dominant lingua franca despite subsequent language shifts experienced throughout the middle east however the aramaic languages are now considered endangered the languages are used by the older generation all beyond retirement age and so could go extinct within generation however researchers are working to record all the dialects of neo aramaic languages before they go extinct royal aramaic inscriptions from the aramean city states date from th century bc making aramaic one of the world oldest recorded living languages name the carpentras stele was the first ancient inscription ever identified as aramaic although it was first published in it was not identified as aramaic until when ulrich friedrich kopp complained that previous scholars had left everything to the phoenicians and nothing to the arameans as if they could not have written at all in historical sources aramaic language is designated by two distinctive groups of terms first of them represented by endonymic native names and the other one represented by various exonymic foreign in origin names native endonymic terms for aramaic language were derived from the same word root as the name of its original speakers the ancient arameans endonymic forms were also adopted in some other languages like ancient hebrew in the torah hebrew bible aram is used as proper name of several people including descendants of shem nahor and jacob unlike in hebrew designations for aramaic language in some other ancient languages were mostly exonymic in ancient greek aramaic language was most commonly known as the syrian language in relation to the native non greek inhabitants of the historical region of syria since the name of syria
