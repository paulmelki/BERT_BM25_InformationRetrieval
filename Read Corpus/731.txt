absolute magnitude is measure of the luminosity of celestial object on an inverse logarithmic astronomical magnitude scale an object absolute magnitude is defined to be equal to the apparent magnitude that the object would have if it were viewed from distance of exactly without extinction or dimming of its light due to absorption by interstellar matter and cosmic dust by hypothetically placing all objects at standard reference distance from the observer their luminosities can be directly comparedon magnitude scale as with all astronomical magnitudes the absolute magnitude can be specified for different wavelength ranges corresponding to specified filter bands or passbands for stars commonly quoted absolute magnitude is the absolute visual magnitude which uses the visual band of the spectrum in the ubv photometric system absolute magnitudes are denoted by capital with subscript representing the filter band used for measurement such as mv for absolute magnitude in the band the more luminous an object the smaller the numerical value of its absolute magnitude difference of magnitudes between the absolute magnitudes of two objects corresponds to ratio of in their luminosities and difference of magnitudes in absolute magnitude corresponds to luminosity ratio of for example star of absolute magnitude mv would be times as luminous as star of absolute magnitude mv as measured in the filter band the sun has absolute magnitude mv highly luminous objects can have negative absolute magnitudes for example the milky way galaxy has an absolute magnitude of about an object absolute bolometric magnitude mbol represents its total luminosity over all wavelengths rather than in single filter band as expressed on logarithmic magnitude scale to convert from an absolute magnitude in specific filter band to absolute bolometric magnitude bolometric correction bc is applied for solar system bodies that shine in reflected light different definition of absolute magnitude is used based on standard reference distance of one astronomical unit stars and galaxies in stellar and galactic astronomy the standard distance is parsecs about light years petameters or trillion kilometres star at parsecs has parallax of milliarcseconds galaxies and other extended objects are much larger than parsecs their light is radiated over an extended patch of sky and their overall brightness cannot be directly observed from relatively short distances but the same convention is used galaxy magnitude is defined by measuring all the light radiated over the entire object treating that integrated brightness as the brightness of single point like or star like source and computing the magnitude of that point like source as it would appear if observed at the standard parsecs distance consequently the absolute magnitude of any object equals the apparent magnitude it would have if it were parsecs away the measurement of absolute magnitude is made with an instrument called bolometer when using an absolute magnitude one must specify the type of electromagnetic radiation being measured when referring to total energy output the proper term is bolometric magnitude the bolometric magnitude usually is computed from the visual magnitude plus bolometric correction this correction is needed because very hot stars radiate mostly ultraviolet radiation whereas very cool stars radiate mostly infrared radiation see planck law some stars visible to the naked eye have such low absolute magnitude that they would appear bright enough to outshine the planets and cast shadows if they were at parsecs from the earth examples include rigel deneb naos and betelgeuse for comparison sirius has an absolute magnitude of only which is still brighter than the sun whose absolute visual magnitude is the sun absolute bolometric magnitude is set arbitrarily usually at absolute magnitudes of stars generally range from to the absolute magnitudes of galaxies can be much lower brighter for example the giant elliptical galaxy has an absolute magnitude of as bright as about stars of magnitude some active galactic nuclei quasars like cta can reach absolute magnitudes in excess of making them the most luminous objects in the observable universe apparent magnitude the greek astronomer hipparchus established numerical scale to describe the brightness of each star appearing in the sky the brightest stars in the sky were assigned an apparent magnitude and the dimmest stars visible to the naked eye are assigned the difference between them corresponds to factor of in brightness for objects within the immediate neighborhood of the sun the absolute magnitude and apparent magnitude from any distance in parsecs with pc light years are related by where is the radiant flux measured at distance in parsecs the radiant flux measured at distance using the common logarithm the equation can be written as where it is assumed that extinction from gas and dust is negligible typical extinction rates within the milky way galaxy are to magnitudes per kiloparsec when dark clouds are taken into account for objects at very large distances outside the milky way the luminosity distance distance defined using luminosity measurements must be used instead of because the euclidean approximation is invalid for distant objects instead general relativity must be taken into account moreover the cosmological redshift complicates the relationship between absolute and apparent magnitude because the radiation observed was shifted into the red range of the spectrum to compare the magnitudes of very distant objects with those of local objects correction might have to be applied to the magnitudes of the distant objects the absolute magnitude can also be written in terms of the apparent magnitude and stellar parallax or using apparent magnitude and distance modulus examples rigel has visual magnitude of and distance of about light years vega has parallax of and an apparent magnitude of the black eye galaxy has visual magnitude of and distance modulus of bolometric magnitude the bolometric magnitude takes into account electromagnetic radiation at all wavelengths it includes those unobserved due to instrumental passband the earth atmospheric absorption and extinction by interstellar dust it is defined based on the luminosity of the stars in the case of stars with few observations it must be computed assuming an effective temperature classically the difference in bolometric magnitude is related to the
