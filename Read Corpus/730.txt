asteroid cybele and two stars with their magnitudes labeled apparent magnitude is measure of the brightness of star or other astronomical object observed from earth an object apparent magnitude depends on its intrinsic luminosity its distance from earth and any extinction of the object light caused by interstellar dust along the line of sight to the observer the word magnitude in astronomy unless stated otherwise usually refers to celestial object apparent magnitude the magnitude scale dates back to the ancient astronomer ptolemy whose star catalog listed stars from st magnitude brightest to th magnitude dimmest the modern scale was mathematically defined in way to closely match this historical system the scale is reverse logarithmic the brighter an object is the lower its magnitude number difference of in magnitude corresponds to brightness ratio of or about for example star of magnitude is times brighter than star of magnitude times brighter than star of magnitude and times brighter than one of magnitude the brightest astronomical objects have negative apparent magnitudes for example venus at or sirius at the faintest stars visible with the naked eye on the darkest night have apparent magnitudes of about though this varies depending on person eyesight and with altitude and atmospheric conditions the apparent magnitudes of known objects range from the sun at to objects in deep hubble space telescope images of around magnitude the measurement of apparent magnitude is called photometry photometric measurements are made in the ultraviolet visible or infrared wavelength bands using standard passband filters belonging to photometric systems such as the ubv system or the strömgren uvbyβ system absolute magnitude is measure of the intrinsic luminosity of celestial object rather than its apparent brightness and is expressed on the same reverse logarithmic scale absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude that star or object would have if it were observed from distance of when referring to just magnitude apparent magnitude rather than absolute magnitude is normally intended history visible bright nessrelativeto vega number of stars other than sun brighter thanapparent magnitudein the night sky yes sirius no the scale used to indicate magnitude originates in the hellenistic practice of dividing stars visible to the naked eye into six magnitudes the brightest stars in the night sky were said to be of first magnitude whereas the faintest were of sixth magnitude which is the limit of human visual perception without the aid of telescope each grade of magnitude was considered twice the brightness of the following grade logarithmic scale although that ratio was subjective as no photodetectors existed this rather crude scale for the brightness of stars was popularized by ptolemy in his almagest and is generally believed to have originated with hipparchus this cannot be proved or disproved because hipparchus original star catalogue is lost the only preserved text by hipparchus himself commentary to aratus clearly documents that he did not have system to describe brightnesses with numbers he always uses terms like big or small bright or faint or even descriptions like visible at fullmoon in norman robert pogson formalized the system by defining first magnitude star as star that is times as bright as sixth magnitude star thereby establishing the logarithmic scale still in use today this implies that star of magnitude is about times as bright as star of magnitude this figure the fifth root of became known as pogson ratio the zero point of pogson scale was originally defined by assigning polaris magnitude of exactly astronomers later discovered that polaris is slightly variable so they switched to vega as the standard reference star assigning the brightness of vega as the definition of zero magnitude at any specified wavelength apart from small corrections the brightness of vega still serves as the definition of zero magnitude for visible and near infrared wavelengths where its spectral energy distribution sed closely approximates that of black body for temperature of however with the advent of infrared astronomy it was revealed that vega radiation includes an infrared excess presumably due to circumstellar disk consisting of dust at warm temperatures but much cooler than the star surface at shorter visible wavelengths there is negligible emission from dust at these temperatures however in order to properly extend the magnitude scale further into the infrared this peculiarity of vega should not affect the definition of the magnitude scale therefore the magnitude scale was extrapolated to all wavelengths on the basis of the black body radiation curve for an ideal stellar surface at uncontaminated by circumstellar radiation on this basis the spectral irradiance usually expressed in janskys for the zero magnitude point as function of wavelength can be computed small deviations are specified between systems using measurement apparatuses developed independently so that data obtained by different astronomers can be properly compared but of greater practical importance is the definition of magnitude not at single wavelength but applying to the response of standard spectral filters used in photometry over various wavelength bands limiting magnitudes for visual observation at high magnification mm with the modern magnitude systems brightness over very wide range is specified according to the logarithmic definition detailed below using this zero reference in practice such apparent magnitudes do not exceed for detectable measurements the brightness of vega is exceeded by four stars in the night sky at visible wavelengths and more at infrared wavelengths as well as the bright planets venus mars and jupiter and these must be described by negative magnitudes for example sirius the brightest star of the celestial sphere has magnitude of in the visible negative magnitudes for other very bright astronomical objects can be found in the table below astronomers have developed other photometric zeropoint systems as alternatives to the vega system the most widely used is the ab magnitude system in which photometric zeropoints are based on hypothetical reference spectrum having constant flux per unit frequency interval rather than using stellar spectrum or blackbody curve as the reference the ab magnitude zeropoint is defined such that an object ab and vega based
