in geometry an archimedean solid is one of the solids first enumerated by archimedes they are the convex uniform polyhedra composed of regular polygons meeting in identical vertices excluding the five platonic solids which are composed of only one type of polygon and excluding the prisms and antiprisms they differ from the johnson solids whose regular polygonal faces do not meet in identical vertices identical vertices means that each two vertices are symmetric to each other global isometry of the entire solid takes one vertex to the other while laying the solid directly on its initial position observed that th polyhedron the elongated square gyrobicupola or pseudo meets weaker definition of an archimedean solid in which identical vertices means merely that the faces surrounding each vertex are of the same types each vertex looks the same from close up so only local isometry is required grünbaum pointed out frequent error in which authors define archimedean solids using this local definition but omit the th polyhedron if only polyhedra are to be listed the definition must use global symmetries of the polyhedron rather than local neighborhoods prisms and antiprisms whose symmetry groups are the dihedral groups are generally not considered to be archimedean solids even though their faces are regular polygons and their symmetry groups act transitively on their vertices excluding these two infinite families there are archimedean solids all the archimedean solids but not the elongated square gyrobicupola can be made via wythoff constructions from the platonic solids with tetrahedral octahedral and icosahedral symmetry origin of name the archimedean solids take their name from archimedes who discussed them in now lost work pappus refers to it stating that archimedes listed polyhedra during the renaissance artists and mathematicians valued pure forms with high symmetry and by around johannes kepler had completed the rediscovery of the polyhedra as well as defining the prisms antiprisms and the non convex solids known as kepler poinsot polyhedra see for more information about the rediscovery of the archimedean solids during the renaissance kepler may have also found the elongated square gyrobicupola at least he once stated that there were archimedean solids however his published enumeration only includes the uniform polyhedra and the first clear statement of the existence was made in by duncan sommerville classification there are archimedean solids not counting the elongated square gyrobicupola if the mirror images of two enantiomorphs the snub cube and snub dodecahedron are counted separately here the vertex configuration refers to the type of regular polygons that meet at any given vertex for example vertex configuration of means that square hexagon and octagon meet at vertex with the order taken to be clockwise around the vertex name alternative name schläflicoxeter transparent solid net vertexconf fig faces edges vert volume unit

elongated square gyrobicupola or pseudo properties the number of vertices is divided by the vertex angle defect the cuboctahedron and are edge uniform and are called quasi regular the duals of the archimedean solids are called the catalan solids together with the bipyramids and trapezohedra these are the face uniform solids with regular vertices chirality the snub cube and snub dodecahedron are known as chiral as they come in left handed form latin levomorph or laevomorph and right handed form latin dextromorph when something comes in multiple forms which are each other three dimensional mirror image these forms may be called enantiomorphs this nomenclature is also used for the forms of certain chemical compounds construction of archimedean solids generator positions in kaleidoscope the different archimedean and platonic solids can be related to each other using handful of general constructions starting with platonic solid truncation involves cutting away of corners to preserve symmetry the cut is in plane perpendicular to the line joining corner to the center of the polyhedron and is the same for all corners depending on how much is truncated see table below different platonic and archimedean and other solids can be created if the truncation is exactly deep enough such that each pair of faces from adjacent vertices shares exactly one point it is known as rectification an expansion or cantellation involves moving each face away from the center by the same distance so as to preserve the symmetry of the platonic solid and taking the convex hull expansion with twisting also involves rotating the faces thus splitting each rectangle corresponding to an edge into two triangles by one of the diagonals of the rectangle the last construction we use here is truncation of both corners and edges ignoring scaling expansion can also be viewed the rectification of the rectification likewise the cantitruncation can be viewed as the truncation of the
