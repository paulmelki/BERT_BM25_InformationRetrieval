international atomic time tai from the french name is high precision atomic coordinate time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on earth geoid it is the principal realisation of terrestrial time with fixed offset of epoch it is also the basis for coordinated universal time utc which is used for civil timekeeping all over the earth surface when another leap second was added tai is exactly seconds ahead of utc the seconds results from the initial difference of seconds at the start of plus leap seconds in utc since tai may be reported using traditional means of specifying days carried over from non uniform time standards based on the rotation of the earth specifically both julian days and the gregorian calendar are used tai in this form was synchronised with universal time at the beginning of and the two have drifted apart ever since due to the changing motion of the earth operation tai is weighted average of the time kept by over atomic clocks in over national laboratories worldwide the majority of the clocks involved are caesium clocks the international system of units si definition of the second is based on caesium the clocks are compared using gps signals and two way satellite time and frequency transfer due to the signal averaging tai is an order of magnitude more stable than its best constituent clock the participating institutions each broadcast in real time frequency signal with timecodes which is their estimate of tai time codes are usually published in the form of utc which differs from tai by well known integer number of seconds these time scales are denoted in the form utc npl in the utc form where npl in this case identifies the national physical laboratory uk the tai form may be denoted tai npl the latter is not to be confused with ta npl which denotes an independent atomic time scale not synchronised to tai or to anything else the clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other the international bureau of weights and measures bipm france combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible this combined time scale is published monthly in circular and is the canonical tai this time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences utc utc equivalent to tai tai for each participating institution the same circular also gives tables of tai ta for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales errors in publication may be corrected by issuing revision of the faulty circular or by errata in subsequent circular aside from this once published in circular the tai scale is not revised in hindsight it is possible to discover errors in tai and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale since the published circulars are definitive better estimates do not create another version of tai it is instead considered to be creating better realisation of terrestrial time tt history early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by single atomic clock the atomic clocks were not operated continuously atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in using the first caesium atomic clock at the national physical laboratory uk npl it was used as basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the royal greenwich observatory and to establish time scale called greenwich atomic ga the united states naval observatory began the scale on september using an atomichron commercial atomic clock followed by the nbs scale at the national bureau of standards boulder colorado on october the international time bureau bih began time scale tm or am in july using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of vlf radio signals the bih scale and nbs were defined by an epoch at the beginning of the procedures used by the bih evolved and the name for the time scale changed in and ta bih in the si second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in from to the general conference on weights and measures and the international committee for weights and measures made series of decisions which designated the bipm time scale international atomic time tai in the it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation and the combined tai scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks starting from julian date january corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks so that tai would correspond to proper time at mean sea level the geoid because the clocks were on average well above sea level this meant that tai slowed by about one part in trillion the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name eal echelle atomique libre meaning free atomic scale the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for barycentric coordinate time tcb geocentric coordinate time tcg and terrestrial time tt which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system all three of these time scales were defined to read jd january exactly at that instant tai was henceforth realisation of tt with the equation tt tai tai the continued existence of tai was questioned in letter from the bipm to the itu which stated in the case of redefinition of utc without leap seconds the cctf would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing tai as it would remain parallel to the continuous utc relation to utc utc is discontinuous time scale it is regularly adjusted by leap seconds between these adjustments it is composed of segments that are mapped to atomic time from its beginning in through december the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that utc approximated ut afterward these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate ut this was compromise arrangement in order to enable publicly broadcast time scale the less frequent whole second adjustments meant that
