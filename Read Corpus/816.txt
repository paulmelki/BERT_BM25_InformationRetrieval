the apple iii styled as apple is business oriented personal computer produced by apple computer and released in running the apple sos operating system it was intended as the successor to the apple ii series but was largely considered failure in the market it was designed to provide key features business users wanted in personal computer true typewriter style upper lowercase keyboard the apple ii only supported uppercase and an column display work on the apple iii started in late under the guidance of dr wendell sander it had the internal code name of sara named after sander daughter the system was announced on may and released in late november that year serious stability issues required design overhaul and recall of the first machines produced the apple iii was formally reintroduced on november damage to the computer reputation had already been done and it failed to do well commercially development stopped and the apple iii was discontinued on april and its last successor the iii plus was dropped from the apple product line in september an estimated apple iii computers were sold the apple iii plus brought this up to approximately apple co founder steve wozniak stated that the primary reason for the apple iii failure was that the system was designed by apple marketing department unlike apple previous engineering driven projects the apple iii failure led apple to reevaluate its plan to phase out the apple ii prompting the eventual continuation of development of the older machine as result later apple ii models incorporated some hardware and software technologies of the apple iii such as the thermal apple scribe printer overview design steve wozniak and steve jobs expected hobbyists to purchase the apple ii but because of visicalc and disk ii small businesses purchased of the computers the apple iii was designed to be business computer and successor though the apple ii contributed to the inspirations of several important business products such as visicalc multiplan and apple writer the computer hardware architecture operating system and developer environment are limited apple management intended to clearly establish market segmentation by designing the apple iii to appeal to the business market leaving the apple ii to home and education users management believed that once the apple iii was out the apple ii would stop selling in six months wozniak said the apple iii is powered by megahertz synertek or bit cpu and like some of the later machines in the apple ii family uses bank switching techniques to address memory beyond the traditional kb limit up to kb in the iii case third party vendors produced memory upgrade kits that allow the apple iii to reach up to kb of random access memory ram other apple iii built in features include an column line display with upper and lowercase characters numeric keypad dual speed pressure sensitive cursor control keys bit dac audio and built in kilobyte inch floppy disk drive graphics modes include in black and white and with colors or shades of gray unlike the apple ii the disk iii controller is part of the logic board the apple iii is the first apple product to allow the user to choose both screen font and keyboard layout either qwerty or dvorak these choices cannot be changed while programs were running unlike the apple iic which has keyboard switch directly above the keyboard allowing the user to switch on the fly software an advertisement for access to health information through the apple iii the apple iii introduced an advanced operating system called apple sos pronounced apple sauce its ability to address resources by name allows the apple iii to be more scalable than the apple ii addressing by physical location such as pr catalog apple sos allows the full capacity of storage device to be used as single volume such as the apple profile hard disk drive and it supports hierarchical file system some of the features and code base of apple sos were later adopted into the apple ii prodos and gs os operating systems as well as lisa and macintosh system software with starting price between to the apple iii was more expensive than many of the cp based business computers that were available at the time few software applications other than visicalc are available for the computer according to presentation at kansasfest fewer than apple iii specific software packages were ever published most shipping when the iii plus was released because apple did not view the apple iii as suitable for hobbyists it did not provide much of the technical software information that accompanies the apple ii originally intended as direct replacement to the apple ii series it was designed to be backward compatible with apple ii software however since apple did not want to encourage continued development of the ii platform apple ii compatibility exists only in special apple ii mode which is limited in its capabilities to the emulation of basic apple ii plus configuration with kb of ram special chips were intentionally added to prevent access from apple ii mode to the iii advanced features such as its larger amount of memory peripherals the apple iii has four expansion slots number that incider in called miserly apple ii cards are compatible but risk violating government rfi regulations and require apple iii specific device drivers byte stated that apple provides virtually no information on how to write them as with software apple provided little hardware technical information with the computer but apple iii specific products became available such as one that made the computer compatible with the apple iie several new apple produced peripherals were developed for the apple iii the original apple iii has built in real time clock which is recognized by apple sos the clock was later removed from the revised model and was instead made available as an add on along with the built in floppy drive the apple iii can also handle up to three additional external disk iii floppy disk drives
