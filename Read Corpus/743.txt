the amiga is family of personal computers introduced by commodore in the original model was one of number of and bit computers that featured kb or more of ram mouse based guis and significantly improved graphics and audio over bit systems this wave included the atari st released the same year apple macintosh and later the apple iigs based on the motorola microprocessor the amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound including sprites and blitter and pre emptive multitasking operating system called amigaos the amiga was released in july but series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early the best selling model the amiga introduced in along with the more expandable professional oriented amiga became one of the leading home computers of the late and early with four to six million sold the was introduced in followed by the and the in march finally the and the were released in late the platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos it also found prominent role in the desktop video video production and show control business leading to video editing systems such as the video toaster the amiga native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it popular platform for early tracker music software the relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of rendering packages including lightwave imagine aladdin turbosilver and traces predecessor to blender although early commodore advertisements attempt to cast the computer as an all purpose business machine especially when outfitted with the amiga sidecar pc compatibility add on the amiga was most commercially successful as home computer with wide range of games and creative software poor marketing and the failure of the later models to repeat the technological advances of the first systems meant that the amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms such as the fourth generation game consoles macintosh and the rapidly dropping prices of ibm pc compatibles which gained color vga graphics in commodore ultimately went bankrupt in april after version of the amiga packaged as game console the amiga cd failed in the marketplace since the demise of commodore various groups have marketed successors to the original amiga line including genesi eyetech acube systems srl and eon technology likewise amigaos has influenced replacements clones and compatible systems such as morphos amigaos and aros history concept and early development jay miner joined atari inc in the to develop custom integrated circuits and led development of the atari tia almost as soon as its development was complete the team began developing much more sophisticated set of chips ctia antic and pokey that formed the basis of the atari bit family with the bit line launch in the team once again started looking at next generation chipset nolan bushnell had sold the company to warner communications in and the new management was much more interested in the existing lines than development of new products that might cut into their sales miner wanted to start work with the new motorola but management was only interested in another based system miner left the company and for time the industry in larry kaplan left atari and founded activision in kaplan was approached by number of investors who wanted to develop new game platform kaplan hired miner to run the hardware side of the newly formed company hi toro the system was code named lorraine in keeping with miner policy of giving systems female names in this case the company president wife lorraine morse when kaplan left the company late in miner was promoted to head engineer and the company relaunched as amiga corporation the boing ball breadboard prototype was largely completed by late and shown at the january consumer electronics show ces at the time the operating system was not ready so the machine was demonstrated with the boing ball demo real time animation showing red and white spinning ball bouncing and casting shadow this bouncing ball became the official logo of the amiga company ces attendees had trouble believing the computer being demonstrating had the power to display such demo and searched in vain for the real computer behind it further developed version of the system was demonstrated at the june ces and shown to many companies in hopes of garnering further funding but found little interest in market that was in the final stages of the video game crash of in march atari expressed tepid interest in lorraine for its potential use in games console or home computer tentatively known as the xld but the talks were progressing slowly and amiga was running out of money temporary arrangement in june led to loan from atari to amiga to keep the company going the terms required the loan to be repaid at the end of the month otherwise amiga would forfeit the lorraine design to atari commodore launch during atari lost over million week due to the combined effects of the crash and the ongoing price war in the home computer market by the end of the year warner was desperate to sell the company in january jack tramiel resigned from commodore due to internal battles over the future direction of the company number of commodore employees followed him to his new company tramel technology this included number of the senior technical staff where they began development of based machine of their own in june tramiel arranged no cash deal to take over atari reforming it as atari corporation as many commodore technical staff had moved to atari commodore was left with no workable path to design their own next generation computer the company approached amiga offering to fund development as home computer system they quickly arranged to repay the atari loan ending that threat the two companies were initially arranging million license agreement before commodore offered million to purchase amiga outright by late the prototype breadboard chipset had successfully been turned into
