ara latin the altar the southern constellation between scorpius telescopium triangulum australe and norma was as βωμός bōmǒs one of the greek bulk namely described by the nd century astronomer ptolemy and it remains one of the modern constellations defined by the international astronomical union the orange supergiant beta arae to us its brightest star measured with near constant apparent magnitude of is marginally brighter than blue white alpha arae seven star systems are known to host planets sunlike mu arae hosts four known planets gliese is gravity paired binary red dwarf system with four known planets the milky way crosses the northwestern part of ara within the constellation is westerlund super star cluster that contains the red hypergiant westerlund possibly the largest star known history manuchihr globe made in mashhad ad adilnor collection sweden in ancient greek mythology ara was identified as the altar where the gods first made offerings and formed an alliance before defeating the titans one of the southernmost constellations depicted by ptolemy it had been recorded by aratus in bc as lying close to the horizon and the almagest portrays stars as far south as gamma arae professor bradley schaefer proposes such ancients must have been able to see as far south as zeta arae for pattern that looked like an altar johann elert bode illustration of ara from his uranographia in illustrations ara is usually depicted as compact classical altar with its smoke rising southward however depictions often vary in the early days of printing woodcut of gaius julius hyginus classic poeticon astronomicon depicts the altar as surrounded by demons johann bayer in depicted ara as an altar with burning incense hyginus depicted the same though his featured devils on either side of the flames willem blaeu dutch uranographer of the th and th centuries drew ara as an altar for sacrifices with burning animal offering unusually whose smoke rises northward represented by alpha arae the castle of knowledge by robert record of lists the constellation stating that under the scorpions tayle standeth the altar decade later translation of fairly recent mainly astrological work by marcellus palingenius of by barnabe googe states here mayst thou both the altar and the myghty cup beholde equivalents in chinese astronomy the stars of the constellation ara lie within the azure dragon of the east 東方青龍 dōng fāng qīng lóng five stars of ara formed guī tortoise while another three formed chǔ pestle the wardaman people of the northern territory in australia saw the stars of ara and the neighbouring constellation pavo as flying foxes characteristics covering square degrees and hence of the sky ara ranks rd of the modern constellations by area its position in the southern celestial hemisphere means that the whole constellation is visible to observers south of scorpius runs along the length of its northern border while norma and triangulum australe border it to the west apus to the south and pavo and telescopium to the east respectively the three letter abbreviation for the constellation as adopted by the international astronomical union is ara the official constellation boundaries as set by belgian astronomer eugène delporte in are defined by polygon of twelve segments in the equatorial coordinate system the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and while the declination coordinates are between and features the constellation ara as it can be seen by the naked eye stars bayer gave eight stars bayer designations labelling them alpha through to theta though he had never seen the constellation directly as it never rises above the horizon in germany after charting the southern constellations french astronomer nicolas louis de lacaille recharted the stars of ara from alpha though to sigma including three pairs of stars next to each other as epsilon kappa and nu ara contains part of the milky way to the south of scorpius and thus has rich star fields within the constellation borders there are stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude just shading alpha arae beta arae is the brightest star in the constellation it is an orange hued star of spectral type ib iia that has been classified as supergiant or bright giant that is around light years from earth it is around times as massive and times as luminous as the sun at apparent magnitude this difference in brightness between the two is undetectable by the unaided eye close to beta arae is gamma arae blue hued supergiant of spectral type ib of apparent magnitude it is light years from earth it has been estimated to be between and times as massive as the sun and have around times its luminosity alpha arae is blue white main sequence star of magnitude that is light years from earth this star is around times as massive as the sun and has an average of times its radius it is times as luminous as the sun its energy emitted from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of be star alpha arae is surrounded by dense equatorial disk of material in keplerian rather than uniform rotation the star is losing mass by polar stellar wind with terminal velocity of approximately km the third brightest star in ara at magnitude is zeta arae an orange giant of spectral type iii that is located light years from earth around times as massive as the sun it has swollen to diameter around times that of the sun and is times as luminous were it not dimmer by intervening interstellar dust it would be significantly brighter at magnitude delta arae is blue white main sequence star of spectral type vn and magnitude light years from earth it is around times as massive as the sun epsilon arae is an orange giant of apparent magnitude light years distant from earth it is around more massive than the sun at an age of about billion years the outer envelope of the star has expanded to almost times the sun radius eta arae is an orange giant
