large ml glass of abv red wine has about three units of alcohol medium ml glass has about two units units of alcohol are used in the united kingdom uk as measure to quantify the actual alcoholic content within given volume of an alcoholic beverage in order to provide guidance on total alcohol consumption number of other countries including australia canada new zealand and the us use the concept of standard drink the definition of which varies from country to country for the same purpose standard drinks were referred to in the first uk guidelines that published safe limits for drinking but these were replaced by references to alcohol units in the guidelines and the latter term has been used in all subsequent uk guidance one unit of alcohol uk is defined as millilitres grams of pure alcohol typical drinks typical quantities or servings of common alcoholic drinks may contain units of alcohol containers of alcoholic drinks sold directly to uk consumers are normally labelled to indicate the number of units of alcohol in typical serving optional and in the full container can or bottle as well as information about responsible drinking as an approximate guideline typical healthy adult can metabolise break down about one unit of alcohol per hour although this may vary depending on sex age weight health and many other factors formula the number of uk units of alcohol in drink can be determined by multiplying the volume of the drink in millilitres by its percentage abv and dividing by for example one imperial pint ml of beer at alcohol by volume abv contains the formula uses this results in exactly one unit per percentage point per litre of any alcoholic beverage the formula can be simplified for everyday use by expressing the serving size in centilitres and the alcohol content literally as percentage thus ml bottle of wine at abv contains cl units alternatively the serving size in litres multiplied by the alcohol content as number the above example giving units both pieces of input data are usually mentioned in this form on the bottle so is easy to retrieve labelling example of wine bottle label in accordance with uk voluntary health labelling scheme uk alcohol companies pledged in march to implement an innovative health labelling scheme to provide more information about responsible drinking on alcohol labels and containers this voluntary scheme is the first of its kind in europe and has been developed in conjunction with the uk department of health the pledge stated we will ensure that over of products on shelf by december will have labels with clear unit content nhs guidelines and warning about drinking when pregnant at the end of companies had committed to the pledge labelling scheme there are five elements included within the overall labelling scheme the first three being mandatory and the last two optional unit alcohol content per container mandatory and per serving optional chief medical officer daily guidelines for lower risk consumption pregnancy warning in text or as graphic mention of drinkaware co uk optional responsibility statement please drink responsibly optional further detailed specifications about the labelling scheme are available from the alcohol labelling tool kit drinks companies had pledged to display the three mandatory items on of drinks containers on shelves in the uk off trade by the end of december report published in november confirmed that uk drinks producers had delivered on that pledge with compliance with the pledge elements as measured by products on shelf compared with labels from on like for like basis information on unit alcohol content had increased by of products displayed alcohol and pregnancy warnings in and showed the chief medical officers lower risk daily guidelines in quantities chart showing alcohol unit count for drink size and abv it is sometimes misleadingly stated that there is one unit per half pint of beer or small glass of wine or single measure of spirits however such statements do not take into account the various strengths and volumes supplied in practice for example the abv of beer typically varies from to typical medium glass of wine with ml at abv has units and spirits although typically abv have single measures of ml or ml so or units depending on location the misleading nature of one unit per half pint of beer or small glass of wine or single measure of spirits can lead to people underestimating their alcohol intake beers half an imperial pint ml of beer with abv contains almost exactly one unit however most beers are stronger in pubs in the united kingdom beers generally range from abv and continental lagers start at around abv an imperial pint of such lager ml at contains almost units of alcohol rather than the oft quoted units stronger beer may contain units or more per half pint imperial half litre ml of standard lager or ale contains units one litre ml of typical oktoberfest beer contains units of alcohol beer bottle is typically ml approximately units at wines medium glass ml of abv wine contains around two units of alcohol however british pubs and restaurants often supply larger quantities large glass ml which contain units red wines often have higher alcohol content on average sometimes up to wine sold by the glass is often served in nearly full glasses wine served at home or when bought by the bottle in say restaurant is usually served in glasses less than half filled the capacity of wine glass is not the only criterion for judging quantity ml bottle of abv wine contains units abv wine contains units fortified wine such as port at abv contains units fortified wines small glass ml of sherry fortified wine or cream liqueur abv contains about one unit spirits most spirits sold in the united kingdom have abv or slightly less in england single pub measure ml of spirit contains one unit however larger ml measure is increasingly used and in particular is standard in northern ireland which contains
