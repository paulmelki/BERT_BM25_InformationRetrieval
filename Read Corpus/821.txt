in abstract algebra field extension is called algebraic if every element of is algebraic over if every element of is root of some non zero polynomial with coefficients in field extensions that are not algebraic which contain transcendental elements are called transcendental for example the field extension that is the field of real numbers as an extension of the field of rational numbers is transcendental while the field extensions and are algebraic where is the field of complex numbers all transcendental extensions are of infinite degree this in turn implies that all finite extensions are algebraic the converse is not true however there are infinite extensions which are algebraic for instance the field of all algebraic numbers is an infinite algebraic extension of the rational numbers if is algebraic over then the set of all polynomials in with coefficients in is not only ring but field an algebraic extension of which has finite degree over the converse is true as well if is field then is algebraic over in the special case where is the field of rational numbers is an example of an algebraic number field field with no proper algebraic extensions is called algebraically closed an example is the field of complex numbers every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed called its algebraic closure but proving this in general requires some form of the axiom of choice an extension is algebraic if and only if every sub algebra of is field properties the class of algebraic extensions forms distinguished class of field extensions that is the following three properties hold if is an algebraic extension of and is an algebraic extension of then is an algebraic extension of if and are algebraic extensions of in common overfield then the compositum ef is an algebraic extension of if is an algebraic extension of and then is an algebraic extension of these finitary results can be generalized using transfinite induction this fact together with zorn lemma applied to an appropriately chosen poset establishes the existence of algebraic closures generalizations model theory generalizes the notion of algebraic extension to arbitrary theories an embedding of into is called an algebraic extension if for every in there is formula with parameters in such that is true and the set is finite it turns out that applying this definition to the theory of fields gives the usual definition of algebraic extension the galois group of over can again be defined as the group of automorphisms and it turns out that most of the theory of galois groups can be developed for the general case see also integral element l√ºroth theorem galois extension separable extension normal extension notes references
