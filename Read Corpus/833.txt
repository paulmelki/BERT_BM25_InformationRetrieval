university under john anderson aixi universal artificial intelligence developed by marcus hutter at idsia and anu calo darpa funded institution effort to integrate many artificial intelligence approaches natural language processing speech recognition machine vision probabilistic logic planning reasoning many forms of machine learning into an ai assistant that learns to help manage your office environment chrest developed under fernand gobet at brunel university and peter lane at the university of hertfordshire clarion developed under ron sun at rensselaer polytechnic institute and university of missouri cojack an act inspired extension to the jack multi agent system that adds cognitive architecture to the agents for eliciting more realistic human like behaviors in virtual environments copycat by douglas hofstadter and melanie mitchell at the indiana university dual developed at the new bulgarian university under boicho kokinov forr developed by susan epstein at the city university of new york ida and lida implementing global workspace theory developed under stan franklin at the university of memphis opencog prime developed using the opencog framework procedural

the pennsylvania state university soar developed under allen newell and john laird at carnegie mellon university and the university of michigan society of mind and its successor the emotion machine proposed by marvin minsky subsumption architectures developed by rodney brooks though it could be argued whether they are cognitive games alphago software developed by google that plays the chinese board game go chinook computer program that plays english draughts the first to win the world champion title in the competition against humans deep blue chess playing computer developed by ibm which beat garry kasparov in freehal self learning conversation simulator chatterbot which uses semantic nets to organize its knowledge to imitate very close human behavior within conversations halite an artificial intelligence programming competition created by two sigma libratus poker ai that beat world class poker players in intended to be generalisable to other applications quick draw an online game developed by google that challenges players to draw picture of an object or idea and then uses neural network to guess what the drawing is stockfish ai an open source chess engine currently ranked the highest in many computer chess rankings td gammon program that learned to play world class backgammon partly by playing against itself temporal difference learning with neural networks internet activism serenata de amor project for the analysis of public expenditures and detect discrepancies knowledge and reasoning braina an intelligent personal assistant application with voice interface for windows os cyc an attempt to assemble an ontology and database of everyday knowledge enabling human like reasoning eurisko language by douglas lenat for solving problems which consists of heuristics including some for how to use and change its heuristics google now an intelligent personal assistant with voice interface in google android and apple inc ios as well as google chrome web browser on personal computers holmes new ai created by wipro microsoft cortana an intelligent personal assistant with voice interface in microsoft various windows editions mycin an early medical expert system open mind common sense project based at the mit media lab to build large common sense knowledge base from online contributions publicly available text analyzer siri an intelligent personal assistant and knowledge navigator with voice interface in apple inc ios and macos sneps simultaneously logic based frame based and network based knowledge representation reasoning and acting system viv software new ai by the creators of siri wolfram alpha an online service that answers queries by computing the answer from structured data motion and manipulation aibo the robot pet for the home grew out of sony computer science laboratory csl cog robot developed by mit to study theories of cognitive science and artificial intelligence now discontinued music melomics bioinspired technology for music composition and synthesization of music where computers develop their own style rather than mimic musicians natural language processing aiml an xml dialect for creating natural language software agents apache lucene high performance full featured text search engine library written entirely in java apache opennlp machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text it supports the most common nlp tasks such as tokenization sentence segmentation part of speech tagging named entity extraction chunking and parsing artificial linguistic internet computer entity an award winning natural language processing chatterbot cleverbot successor to jabberwacky now with lines of conversation deep context fuzziness and parallel processing cleverbot learns from around million user interactions per month eliza famous computer program by joseph weizenbaum which parodied person centered therapy gpt language model developed by openai that can produce text difficult to distinguish from that written by human jabberwacky chatterbot by rollo carpenter aiming to simulate natural human chat mycroft free and open source intelligent personal assistant that uses natural language user interface parry another early chatterbot written in by kenneth colby attempting to simulate paranoid schizophrenic shrdlu an early natural language processing computer program developed by terry winograd at mit from to systran machine translation technology by the company of the same name used by yahoo altavista and google among others other the road the first novel marketed by an ai synthetic environment for analysis and simulations seas model of the real world used by homeland security and the united states department of defense that uses simulation and ai to predict and evaluate future events and
