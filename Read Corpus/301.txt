atomic physics is the field of physics that studies atoms as an isolated system of electrons and an atomic nucleus it is primarily concerned with the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus and the processes by which these arrangements change this comprises ions neutral atoms and unless otherwise stated it can be assumed that the term atom includes ions the term atomic physics can be associated with nuclear power and nuclear weapons due to the synonymous use of atomic and nuclear in standard english physicists distinguish between atomic physics which deals with the atom as system consisting of nucleus and electrons and nuclear physics which studies nuclear reactions and special properties of atomic nuclei as with many scientific fields strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of atomic molecular and optical physics physics research groups are usually so classified isolated atoms atomic physics primarily considers atoms in isolation atomic models will consist of single nucleus that may be surrounded by one or more bound electrons it is not concerned with the formation of molecules although much of the physics is identical nor does it examine atoms in solid state as condensed matter it is concerned with processes such as ionization and excitation by photons or collisions with atomic particles while modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic if one considers atoms in gas or plasma then the time scales for atom atom interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic processes that are generally considered this means that the individual atoms can be treated as if each were in isolation as the vast majority of the time they are by this consideration atomic physics provides the underlying theory in plasma physics and atmospheric physics even though both deal with very large numbers of atoms electronic configuration electrons form notional shells around the nucleus these are normally in ground state but can be excited by the absorption of energy from light photons magnetic fields or interaction with colliding particle typically ions or other electrons in the bohr model the transition of an electron with to the shell is shown where photon is emitted an electron from shell must have been removed beforehand by ionization electrons that populate shell are said to be in bound state the energy necessary to remove an electron from its shell taking it to infinity is called the binding energy any quantity of energy absorbed by the electron in excess of this amount is converted to kinetic energy according to the conservation of energy the atom is said to have undergone the process of ionization if the electron absorbs quantity of energy less than the binding energy it will be transferred to an excited state after certain time the electron in an excited state will jump undergo transition to lower state in neutral atom the system will emit photon of the difference in energy since energy is conserved if an inner electron has absorbed more than the binding energy so that the atom ionizes then more outer electron may undergo transition to fill the inner orbital in this case visible photon or characteristic ray is emitted or phenomenon known as the auger effect may take place where the released energy is transferred to another bound electron causing it to go into the continuum the auger effect allows one to multiply ionize an atom with single photon there are rather strict selection rules as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by excitation by light however there are no such rules for excitation by collision processes history and developments one of the earliest steps towards atomic physics was the recognition that matter was composed of atoms it forms part of the texts written in th century bc to nd century bc such as those of democritus or vaisheshika sutra written by kanad this theory was later developed in the modern sense of the basic unit of chemical element by the british chemist and physicist john dalton in the th century at this stage it wasn clear what atoms were although they could be described and classified by their properties in bulk the invention of the periodic system of elements by mendeleev was another great step forward the true beginning of atomic physics is marked by the discovery of spectral lines and attempts to describe the phenomenon most notably by joseph von fraunhofer the study of these lines led to the bohr atom model and to the birth of quantum mechanics in seeking to explain atomic spectra an entirely new mathematical model of matter was revealed as far as atoms and their electron shells were concerned not only did this yield better overall description the atomic orbital model but it also provided new theoretical basis for chemistry quantum chemistry and spectroscopy since the second world war both theoretical and experimental fields have advanced at rapid pace this can be attributed to progress in computing technology which has allowed larger and more sophisticated models of atomic structure and associated collision processes similar technological advances in accelerators detectors magnetic field generation and lasers have greatly assisted experimental work significant atomic physicists see also particle physics isomeric shift atomic
