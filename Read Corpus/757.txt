atomic semantics is type of guarantee provided by data register shared by several processors in parallel machine or in network of computers working together atomic semantics are very strong an atomic register provides strong guarantees even when there is concurrency and failures read write register stores value and is accessed by two basic operations read and write read returns the value stored in and write changes the value stored in to register is called atomic if it satisfies the two following properties each invocation op of read or write operation must appear as if it were executed at single point op in time op works as follow τb op op τe op where τb op and τe op indicate the time when the operation op begins and ends if op op then op op each read operation returns the value written by the last write operation before the read in the sequence where all operations are ordered by their values atomic linearizable register termination when node is correct sooner or later each read and write operation will complete safety property linearization points for read and write and failed operations read operation it appears as if happened at all nodes at some times between the invocation and response time write operation similar to read operation it appears as if happened at all nodes at some times between the invocation and response time failed operation the atomic term comes from this notion it appears as if it is completed at every single node or it never happened at any node example we know that an atomic register is one that is linearizable to sequential safe register atomic the following picture shows where we should put the linearization point for each operation atomic register an atomic register could be defined for variable with single writer but multi readers swmr single writer single reader swsr or multi writer multi reader mwmr here is an example of multi reader multi writer atomic register which is accessed by three processes note that read means that the corresponding read operation returns which is the value of the register therefore the following execution of the register could satisfies the definition of the atomic registers write read write write read read atomic mwmr see also regular semantics safe semantics references atomic semantics are defined formally in lamport on interprocess communication distributed computing also appeared as src research report
