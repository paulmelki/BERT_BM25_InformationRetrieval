an abscess is collection of pus that has built up within the tissue of the body signs and symptoms of abscesses include redness pain warmth and swelling the swelling may feel fluid filled when pressed the area of redness often extends beyond the swelling carbuncles and boils are types of abscess that often involve hair follicles with carbuncles being larger they are usually caused by bacterial infection often many different types of bacteria are involved in single infection in the united states and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus rarely parasites can cause abscesses this is more common in the developing world diagnosis of skin abscess is usually made based on what it looks like and is confirmed by cutting it open ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear in abscesses around the anus computer tomography ct may be important to look for deeper infection standard treatment for most skin or soft tissue abscesses is cutting it open and drainage there appears to be some benefit from also using antibiotics small amount of evidence supports not packing the cavity that remains with gauze after drainage closing this cavity right after draining it rather than leaving it open may speed healing without increasing the risk of the abscess returning sucking out the pus with needle is often not sufficient skin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years risk factors include intravenous drug use with rates reported as high as among users in in the united states million people went to the emergency department for an abscess in australia around people were hospitalized in with the condition signs and symptoms an abscess abscesses may occur in any kind of tissue but most frequently within the skin surface where they may be superficial pustules known as boils or deep skin abscesses in the lungs brain teeth kidneys and tonsils major complications may include spreading of the abscess material to adjacent or remote tissues and extensive regional tissue death gangrene the main symptoms and signs of skin abscess are redness heat swelling pain and loss of function there may also be high temperature fever and chills if superficial abscesses may be fluctuant when palpated this wave like motion is caused by movement of the pus inside the abscess an internal abscess is more difficult to identify but signs include pain in the affected area high temperature and generally feeling unwell internal abscesses rarely heal themselves so prompt medical attention is indicated if such an abscess is suspected an abscess can potentially be fatal depending on where it is located causes risk factors for abscess formation include intravenous drug use another possible risk factor is prior history of disc herniation or other spinal abnormality though this has not been proven abscesses are caused by bacterial infection parasites or foreign substances bacterial infection is the most common cause often many different types of bacteria are involved in single infection in the united states and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus among spinal subdural abscesses methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism involved rarely parasites can cause abscesses and this is more common in the developing world specific parasites known to do this include dracunculiasis and myiasis perianal abscess surgery of the anal fistula to drain an abscess treats the fistula and reduces likelihood of its recurrence and the need for repeated surgery there is no evidence that fecal incontinence is consequence of this surgery for abscess drainage perianal abscesses can be seen in patients with for example inflammatory bowel disease such as crohn disease or diabetes often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration hard stool or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication this wound typically becomes infected as result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area and then develops into an abscess this often presents itself as lump of tissue near the anus which grows larger and more painful with time like other abscesses perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment such as an incision and debridement or lancing incisional abscess an incisional abscess is one that develops as complication secondary to surgical incision it presents as redness and warmth at the margins of the incision with purulent drainage from it if the diagnosis is uncertain the wound should be aspirated with needle with aspiration of pus confirming the diagnosis and availing for gram stain and bacterial culture pathophysiology an abscess is defensive reaction of the tissue to prevent the spread of infectious materials to other parts of the body the organisms or foreign materials kill the local cells resulting in the release of cytokines the cytokines trigger an inflammatory response which draws large numbers of white blood cells to the area and increases the regional blood flow the final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall or capsule that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures however such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus or from reaching the causative organism or foreign object file blausen abscess png diagram of an abscess file pyemic abscesses of kidney jpg pyemic abscesses of kidney diagnosis ultrasound showing an abscess of the skin thumb an abscess is localized collection of pus purulent inflammatory tissue caused by suppuration buried in tissue an organ or confined space lined by the pyogenic membrane ultrasound imaging in the emergency department can help in diagnosis classification abscesses may be classified as either skin abscesses or internal abscesses skin abscesses are common internal abscesses tend to be harder to diagnose and more serious skin abscesses are also called cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses iv drug use for those with history of intravenous drug use an ray is recommended before treatment to verify that no needle fragments are present
