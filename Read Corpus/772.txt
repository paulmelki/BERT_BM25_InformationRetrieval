delian league before the peloponnesian war in bc the delian league founded in bc was an association of greek city states with the number of members numbering between and under the leadership of athens whose purpose was to continue fighting the persian empire after the greek victory in the battle of plataea at the end of the second persian invasion of greece the league modern name derives from its official meeting place the island of delos where congresses were held in the temple and where the treasury stood until in symbolic gesture pericles moved it to athens in bc shortly after its inception athens began to use the league funds for its own purposes this led to conflict between athens and the less powerful members of the league by bc the threat the league presented to spartan hegemony combined with athens heavy handed control of the delian league prompted the outbreak of the peloponnesian war the league was dissolved upon the war conclusion in bc under the direction of lysander the spartan commander background athenian empire in bc according to the tribute lists the islands of lesbos chios and samos shaded on the map did not pay tribute the greco persian wars had their roots in the conquest of the greek cities of asia minor and particularly ionia by the achaemenid persian empire of cyrus the great shortly after bc the persians found the ionians difficult to rule eventually settling for sponsoring tyrant in each ionian city while greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants this form of government was on the decline by bc ionia appears to have been ripe for rebellion against these persian clients the simmering tension finally broke into open revolt due to the actions of the tyrant of miletus aristagoras attempting to save himself after disastrous persian sponsored expedition in bc aristagoras chose to declare miletus democracy this triggered similar revolutions across ionia extending to doris and aeolis beginning the ionian revolt owl of athena patron of athens the greek states of athens and eretria allowed themselves to be drawn into this conflict by aristagoras and during their only campaigning season bc they contributed to the capture and burning of the persian regional capital of sardis after this the ionian revolt carried on without further outside aid for further five years until it was finally completely crushed by the persians however in decision of great historic significance the persian king darius the great decided that despite having subdued the revolt there remained the unfinished business of exacting punishment on athens and eretria for supporting the revolt the ionian revolt had severely threatened the stability of darius empire and the states of mainland greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of greece beginning with the destruction of athens and eretria in the next two decades there would be two persian invasions of greece occasioning thanks to greek historians some of the most famous battles in history during the first invasion thrace macedon and the aegean islands were added to the persian empire and eretria was duly destroyed however the invasion ended in bc with the decisive athenian victory at the battle of marathon after this invasion darius died and responsibility for the war passed to his son xerxes xerxes then personally led second persian invasion of greece in bc taking an enormous although oft exaggerated army and navy to greece those greeks who chose to resist the allies were defeated in the twin simultaneous battles of thermopylae on land and artemisium at sea all of greece except the peloponnesus thus having fallen into persian hands the persians then seeking to destroy the allied navy once and for all suffered decisive defeat at the battle of salamis the following year bc the allies assembled the largest greek army yet seen and defeated the persian invasion force at the battle of plataea ending the invasion and the threat to greece the allied fleet defeated the remnants of the persian fleet in the battle of mycale near the island of samos on the same day as plataea according to tradition this action marks the end of the persian invasion and the beginning of the next phase in the greco persian wars the greek counterattack after mycale the greek cities of asia minor again revolted with the persians now powerless to stop them the allied fleet then sailed to the thracian chersonese still held by the persians and besieged and captured the town of sestos the following year bc the allies sent force to capture the city of byzantion modern day istanbul the siege was successful but the behaviour of the spartan general pausanias alienated many of the allies and resulted in pausanias recall formation fragment of the athenian tribute list bc after byzantion sparta was eager to end its involvement in the war the spartans greatly feared the rise of the athenians as challenge to their power additionally the spartans were of the view that with the liberation of mainland greece and the greek cities of asia minor the war purpose had already been achieved there was also perhaps feeling that establishing long term security for the asian greeks would prove impossible in the aftermath of mycale the spartan king leotychidas had proposed transplanting all the greeks from asia minor to europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from persian dominion xanthippus the athenian commander at mycale had furiously rejected this the ionian cities had been athenian colonies and the athenians if no one else would protect the ionians this marked the point at which the leadership of the greek alliance effectively passed to the athenians with the spartan withdrawal after byzantion the leadership of the athenians became explicit the loose alliance of city states which had fought against xerxes invasion had been dominated by sparta and the peloponnesian league with the withdrawal of these states congress was called on the holy
