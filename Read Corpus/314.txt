good condition and noted that in july or people fled thither in time of war the french attacked again in and causing much destruction but failing to capture the island it is likely that the early european settlers brought enslaved africans with them historians confirm that african slaves lived in the region in the early th century such as slaves from senegal living on st kitts in the mid by slave depot existed on the island of nevis serving the leeward islands while the time of african arrival in anguilla is difficult to place precisely archival evidence indicates substantial african
