alan mathison turing june june was an english mathematician computer scientist logician cryptanalyst philosopher and theoretical biologist turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science providing formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the turing machine which can be considered model of general purpose computer turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence despite these accomplishments he was never fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime due to the prevalence of homophobia at the time and because much of his work was covered by the official secrets act during the second world war turing worked for the government code and cypher school gc cs at bletchley park britain codebreaking centre that produced ultra intelligence for time he led hut the section that was responsible for german naval cryptanalysis here he devised number of techniques for speeding the breaking of german ciphers including improvements to the pre war polish bombe method an machine that could find settings for the enigma machine turing played crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the allies to defeat the nazis in many crucial engagements including the battle of the atlantic and in so doing helped win the war due to the problems of counterfactual history it is hard to estimate the precise effect ultra intelligence had on the war but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in europe by more than two years and saved over million lives after the war turing worked at the national physical laboratory where he designed the automatic computing engine the automatic computing engine was one of the first designs for stored program computer in turing joined max newman computing machine laboratory at the victoria university of manchester where he helped develop the manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology he wrote paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the belousov zhabotinsky reaction first observed in the turing was prosecuted in for homosexual acts the labouchere amendment of had mandated that gross indecency was criminal offence in the uk he accepted chemical castration treatment with des as an alternative to prison turing died in days before his nd birthday from cyanide poisoning an inquest determined his death as suicide but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning in following an internet campaign british prime minister gordon brown made an official public apology on behalf of the british government for the appalling way he was treated queen elizabeth ii granted turing posthumous pardon in the alan turing law is now an informal term for law in the united kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts early life and education family turing was born in maida vale london while his father julius mathison turing was on leave from his position with the indian

turing birth very early in life turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently his parents purchased house in guildford in and turing lived there during school holidays the location is also marked with blue plaque school turing parents enrolled him at st michael day school at charles road st leonards on sea at the age of six the headmistress recognised his talent early on as did many of his subsequent teachers between january and turing was educated at hazelhurst preparatory school an independent school in the village of frant in sussex now east sussex in at the age of he went on to sherborne school boarding independent school in the market town of sherborne in dorset where he boarded at westcott house the first day of term coincided with the general strike in britain but turing was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied from southampton to sherborne stopping overnight at an inn turing natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at sherborne whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics his headmaster wrote to his parents hope he will not fall between two stools if he is to stay at public school he must aim at becoming educated if he is to be solely scientific specialist he is wasting his time at public school despite this turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved solving advanced problems in without having studied even elementary calculus in aged turing encountered albert einstein
