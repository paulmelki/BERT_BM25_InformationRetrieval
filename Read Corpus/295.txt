throughout history forms of art have gone through periodic abrupt changes called artistic revolutions movements have come to an end to be replaced by new movement markedly different in striking ways see also cultural movements artistic revolution and political revolutions the role of fine art has been to simultaneously express values of the current culture while also offering criticism balance or alternatives to any such values that are proving no longer useful so as times change art changes if changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions the best artists have predated society changes due not to any prescience but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their talent of seeing artists who succeeded enough to portray visions that future generations could live to see often had to navigate an often treacherous path between their own capacity to see and execute what lesser artists could not while still appealing to powerful patrons who could finance their visions for example paintings glorified aristocracy in the early th century when leadership was needed to nationalize small political groupings but later as leadership became oppressive satirization increased and subjects were less concerned with leaders and more with more common plights of mankind no art owes quite as much to state power as french painting does it was in the age of absolute monarchy launched by louis xiv in the th century that the likes of poussin and le brun put france in the forefront of european art versailles found its stately mirror in the powerful idea of classicism painting style enduring in later artists like ingres whose austerity and grandeur express the authority of world where jove is very much in his throne examples of revolutionary art in conjunction with cultural and

revolutionary tides artistic revolution of style here is an example of an artistic revolution pieces scientific and technological not all artistic revolutions were political sometimes science and technological innovations have brought about unforeseen transformations in the works of artists the stylistic revolution known as impressionism by painters eager to more accurately capture the changing colors of light and shadow is inseparable from discoveries and inventions in the mid th century in which the style was born eugene chevreul french chemist hired as director of dyes at french tapestry works began to investigate the optical nature of color in order to improve color in fabrics chevreul realized it was the eye and not the dye that had the greatest influence on color and from this he revolutionized color theory by grasping what came to be called the law of simultaneous contrast that colors mutually influence one another when juxtaposed each imposing its own complementary color on the other the french painter eugène delacroix who had been experimenting with what he called broken tones embraced chevreul book the law of contrast of color with its explanations of how juxtaposed colors can enhance or diminish each other and his exploration of all the visible colors of the spectrum inspired by chevreul treatise delacroix passed his enthusiasm on to the young artists who were inspired by him it was chevreul who led the impressionists to grasp that they should apply separate brushstrokes of pure color to canvas and allow the viewer eye to combine them optically they were aided greatly in this by innovations in oil paint itself since the renaissance painters had to grind pigment add oil and thus create their own paints these time consuming paints also quickly dried out making studio painting necessity for large works and limiting painters to mix one or two colors at time and fill in an entire area using just that one color before it dried out in little known american painter named john rand invented simple improvement without which the impressionist movement could not have occurred the small flexible tin tube with removable cap in which oil paints could be stored oil paints kept in such tubes stayed moist and usable and quite portable for the first time since the renaissance painters were not trapped by the time frame of how quickly oil paint dried paints in tubes could be easily loaded up and carried out into the real world to directly observe the play of color and natural light in shadow and movement to paint in the moment selling the oil paint in tubes also brought about the arrival of dazzling new pigments chrome yellow cadmium blue invented by th century industrial chemists the tubes freed the impressionists to paint quickly and across an entire canvas rather than carefully delineated single color sections at time in short to sketch directly in oil racing across the canvas in every color that came to hand and thus inspiring their name of impressionists since such speedy bold brushwork and dabs of separate colors made contemporary critics think their paintings were mere impressions not finished paintings which were to have no visible brush marks at all seamless under layers of varnish pierre auguste renoir said without colors in tubes there would be no cézanne no monet no pissarro and no impressionism finally the careful hyper realistic techniques of french neo classicism were seen as stiff and lifeless when compared to the remarkable new vision of the world as seen through the new invention of photography by the mid it was not merely that the increasing ability of this new invention particularly by the french inventor daguerre made the realism of the painted image redundant as he deliberately competed in the paris diorama with large scale historical paintings the neo classical subject matter limited by academic tradition to greek and roman legends historical battles and biblical stories seemed oppressively clichéd and limited to artists eager to explore the actual world in front of their own eyes revealed by the camera daily life candid groupings of everyday people doing simple things paris
