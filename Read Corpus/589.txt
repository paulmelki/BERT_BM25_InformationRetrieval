ecclesiastical historian zacharias rhetor who became the bishop of mytilene as part of the persecution of pagans in the late roman empire the alexandrian school was investigated by the roman imperial authorities the patriarch of alexandria peter iii ammonius would limit his teaching in return for keeping his own position this alienated number of his colleagues and pupils including damascius who nonetheless called him the greatest commentator who ever lived in his own life of isidore of alexandria life ammonius father hermias died when he was child and his mother aedesia raised him and his brother heliodorus in alexandria when they reached adulthood aedesia accompanied her sons to athens where they studied under proclus eventually they returned to alexandria where ammonius as head of the neoplatonist school in the city lectured on plato and aristotle for the rest of his life according to damascius during the persecution of the pagans at alexandria in the late ammonius made concessions to the christian authorities so that he could continue his lectures damascius who scolds ammonius for the agreement that he made does not say what the concessions were but it may have involved limitations on the doctrines he could teach or promote he was still teaching in olympiodorus heard him lecture on plato gorgias in that year he was also an accomplished astronomer he lectured on ptolemy and is known to have written treatise on the astrolabe writings first page of the first edition of the isagoge commentary venice of his reputedly numerous writings only his commentary on aristotle de interpretatione survives intact commentary on porphyry isagoge may also be his but it is somewhat corrupt and contains later interpolations in de interpretatione ammonius contends that divine foreknowledge makes void the contingent like boÃ«thius in his second commentary and in the consolation of philosophy this argument maintains the effectiveness of prayer ammonius cites iamblichus who said knowledge is intermediate between the knower and the known since it is the activity of the knower concerning the known in addition there are some notes of ammonius lectures written
