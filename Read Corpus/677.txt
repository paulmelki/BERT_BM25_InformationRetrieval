adhemar was named apostolic legate and appointed to lead the crusade by pope urban ii on november in part adhemar was selected to lead because he had already undertaken pilgrimage to jerusalem in and following the announcement of the crusade adhemar spent the next year raising money and recruiting men departing on august he accompanied raymond of toulouse and his army to the east whilst raymond

of the crusaders during the leg of the trip from durazzo to constantinople in the valley of pelagonia adhemar was set upon by group of pecheneg mercenaries when he had wandered too far from the

attacking one another by accident after the capture of the city in june and the subsequent siege led by kerbogha adhemar organized procession through the streets and had the gates locked so that the crusaders many of whom had begun to panic would be unable to leave the city he was extremely skeptical of peter bartholomew discovery in antioch of the holy lance especially because he knew such relic already existed in constantinople however he was willing to let the crusader army believe it was real if it raised their morale adhemar was protected by band of crusaders led by henry of esch to preserve the albeit suspect relic in june adhemar fell prey to sickness and in the following months his condition would deteriorate when kerbogha was defeated adhemar organized council in an attempt to settle the leadership disputes but died on august probably of typhus adhemar was buried in antioch within the basilica of st peter the disputes among the higher nobles went unsolved and the march to jerusalem was delayed for months however the lower class soldiers continued to think of adhemar as leader following his death adhemar reportedly appeared in several visions of various crusaders one of the first was reported by peter bartholomew who stated that adhemar appeared to him stating that due to his skepticism of the holy lance he had spent few days in hell and was only rescued because candle had been burned in his memory he had given gift to the shrine where the holy lance was kept and due to the prayers of bohemond at the siege of jerusalem peter desiderius claimed that to have received vision from adhemar himself peter also claimed that in this vision adhemar had instructed him to have the crusaders fast and lead procession around the walls of jerusalem this was done and jerusalem was taken by the crusaders in later stephen of valence also claimed to have had visions featuring adhemar in which adhemar spoke to stephen of several relics adhemar told stephen great
