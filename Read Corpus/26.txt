ascii abbreviated from american standard code for information interchange is character encoding standard for electronic communication ascii codes represent text in computers equipment and other devices most modern character encoding schemes are based on ascii although they support many additional characters the internet assigned numbers authority iana prefers the name us ascii for this character encoding ascii is one of the ieee milestones overview ascii was developed from telegraph code its first commercial use was as seven bit teleprinter code promoted by bell data services work on the ascii standard began on october with the first meeting of the american standards association asa now the american national standards institute or ansi subcommittee the first edition of the standard was published in underwent major revision during and experienced its most recent update during compared to earlier telegraph codes the proposed bell code and ascii were both ordered for more convenient sorting alphabetization of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters the use of ascii format for network interchange was described in that document was formally elevated to an internet standard in originally based on the english alphabet ascii encodes specified characters into seven bit integers as shown by the ascii chart above ninety five of the encoded characters are printable these include the digits to lowercase letters to uppercase letters to and punctuation symbols in addition the original ascii specification included non printing control codes which originated with teletype machines most of these are now obsolete although few are still commonly used such as the carriage return line feed and tab codes for example lowercase would be represented in the ascii encoding by binary hexadecimal is the ninth letter decimal history control pictures of equivalent controls are shown where they exist or grey dot otherwise the american standard code for information interchange ascii was developed under the auspices of committee of the american standards association asa called the committee by its later subcommittee and later by that subcommittee working group now incits the asa became the united states of america standards institute usasi and ultimately the american national standards institute ansi with the other special characters and control codes filled in ascii was published as asa leaving code positions without any assigned meaning reserved for future standardization and one unassigned control code there was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet the indecision did not last long during may the ccitt working party on the new telegraph alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to sticks and and international organization for standardization tc sc voted during october to incorporate the change into its draft standard the task group voted its approval for the change to ascii at its may meeting locating the lowercase letters in sticks and caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by single bit which simplified case insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers the committee made other changes including other new characters the brace and vertical bar characters renaming some control characters som became start of header soh and moving or removing others ru was removed ascii was subsequently updated as usas then usas ansi and finally ansi revisions of the ascii standard asa asa approved but not published nevertheless used by ibm display stations and ibm display control usas usas ansi ansi ansi ansi ansi incits ansi incits ansi incits ansi incits in the standard the committee also addressed how ascii should be transmitted least significant bit first and how it should be recorded on perforated tape they proposed track standard for magnetic tape and attempted to deal with some punched card formats design considerations bit width the subcommittee designed ascii based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems like other character encodings ascii specifies correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols graphemes and control characters this allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process store and communicate character oriented information such as written language before ascii was developed the encodings in use included alphabetic characters numerical digits and from to special graphic symbols to include all these and control characters compatible with the comité consultatif international téléphonique et télégraphique ccitt international telegraph alphabet no ita standard of fieldata and early ebcdic more than codes were required for ascii ita were in turn based on the bit telegraph code émile baudot invented in and patented in the committee debated the possibility of shift function like in ita which would allow more than codes to be represented by six bit code in shifted code some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes it allows compact encoding but is less reliable for data transmission as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes long part of the transmission unreadable the standards committee decided against shifting and so ascii required at least seven bit code the committee considered an eight bit code since eight bits octets would allow two four bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary coded decimal however it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice the committee voted to use seven bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position it also allowed for parity bit for error checking if desired eight bit machines with octets as the native data type that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to in some printers the high bit was used to enable italics printing internal organization the code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together for ease of identification the first two so called ascii sticks positions were reserved for control characters the space character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier so it became position hex for the same reason many special signs commonly used
