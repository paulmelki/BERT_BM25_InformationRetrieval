apollo was the sixth crewed flight in the united states apollo program and the second to land on the moon it was launched on november from the kennedy space center florida four months after apollo commander charles pete conrad and apollo lunar module pilot alan bean performed just over one day and seven hours of lunar surface activity while command module pilot richard gordon remained in lunar orbit the landing site for the mission was located in the southeastern portion of the ocean of storms on november conrad and bean achieved precise landing at their expected location within walking distance of the site of the surveyor robotic probe which had landed on april they carried the first color television camera to the lunar surface on an apollo flight but transmission was lost after bean accidentally pointed the camera at the sun and the camera sensor was destroyed on one of two moonwalks they visited surveyor and removed some parts for return to earth lunar module intrepid lifted off from the moon on november and docked with the command module which then after completing its th lunar orbit traveled back to earth the apollo mission ended on november with successful splashdown crew commander pete conrad flew on gemini in and as command pilot on gemini in command module pilot richard gordon jr flew with conrad on gemini originally conrad lunar module pilot was clifton williams jr who was killed in october when the he was flying crashed near tallahassee when forming his crew conrad had wanted alan bean former student of his at the united states naval test pilot school at patuxent river nas maryland but had been told by director of flight crew operations deke slayton that bean was unavailable due to an assignment to the apollo applications program after williams death conrad asked for bean again and this time slayton yielded backup crew support crew gerald carr edward gibson paul weitz flight directors gerry griffin gold team pete frank orange team

photographed by pete conrad reflected in bean helmet launch and transfer apollo launches from kennedy space center november apollo launched on schedule from kennedy space center under completely overcast rainy skies encountering wind speeds of during ascent the highest of any apollo mission lightning struck the saturn seconds after lift off triggered by the vehicle itself discharging down to the earth through the ionized exhaust plume protective circuits on the fuel cells in the service module sm detected overloads and took all three fuel cells offline along with much of the command and service module csm instrumentation second strike at seconds knocked out the ball attitude indicator the telemetry stream at mission control was garbled however the saturn continued to fly normally the strikes had not affected the saturn instrument unit guidance system which functions independently from the csm the loss of all three fuel cells put the csm entirely on batteries which were unable to maintain normal ampere launch loads on the volt dc bus one of the ac inverters dropped offline these power supply problems lit nearly every warning light on the control panel and caused much of the instrumentation to malfunction electrical environmental and consumables manager eecom john aaron remembered the telemetry failure pattern from an earlier test when power supply malfunctioned in the csm signal conditioning electronics sce which converted raw signals from instrumentation to standard voltages for the spacecraft instrument displays and telemetry encoders aaron made call flight eecom try sce to aux which switched the sce to backup power supply the switch was fairly obscure and neither flight director gerald griffin capcom gerald carr nor mission commander pete conrad immediately recognized it lunar module pilot alan bean flying in the right seat as the spacecraft systems engineer remembered the sce switch from training incident year earlier when the same failure had been simulated aaron quick thinking and bean memory saved what could have been an aborted mission and earned aaron the reputation of steely eyed missile man bean put the fuel cells back on line and with telemetry restored the launch continued successfully once in earth parking orbit the crew carefully checked out their spacecraft before re igniting the ivb third stage for trans lunar injection the lightning strikes had caused no serious permanent damage initially it was feared that the lightning strike could have caused the explosive bolts that open the command module parachute compartment to fire prematurely rendering the parachutes useless which would have made safe return impossible the decision was made not to share this with the astronauts since there was little that could be done to verify or resolve the problem if it existed the parachutes deployed and functioned normally at the end of the mission after lm separation the ivb was intended to fly into solar orbit the ivb auxiliary propulsion system was fired and the remaining propellants vented to slow it down to fly past the moon trailing edge the apollo spacecraft always approached the moon leading edge the moon gravity would then slingshot the stage into solar orbit however small error in the state vector in the saturn guidance system caused the ivb to fly past the moon at too high an altitude to achieve earth escape velocity it remained in semi stable earth orbit after passing the moon on november it finally escaped earth orbit in but was briefly recaptured in earth orbit years later it was discovered by
