this painting by anselm feuerbach re imagines scene from plato symposium in which the tragedian agathon welcomes the drunken alcibiades into his home agathon was an athenian tragic poet whose works have been lost he is best known for his appearance in plato symposium which describes the banquet given to celebrate his obtaining prize for his first tragedy at the lenaia in he is also prominent character in aristophanes comedy the life and career agathon was the son of tisamenus and the lover of pausanias with whom he appears in both the symposium and plato protagoras together with pausanias he later moved to the court of archelaus king of macedon who was recruiting playwrights it is here that he probably died around bc agathon introduced certain innovations into the greek theater aristotle tells us in the poetics that the characters and plot of his anthos were original and not following athenian dramatic orthodoxy borrowed from mythological or historical subjects agathon was also the first playwright to write choral parts which were apparently independent from the main plot of his plays agathon is portrayed by plato as handsome young man well dressed of polished manners courted by the fashion wealth and wisdom of athens and dispensing hospitality with ease and refinement the epideictic speech in praise of love which agathon recites in the symposium is full of beautiful but artificial rhetorical expressions and has led some scholars to believe he may have been student of gorgias in the symposium agathon is presented as the friend of the comic poet aristophanes but this alleged friendship did not prevent aristophanes from harshly criticizing agathon in at least two of his comic plays the and the now lost gerytades in the later play frogs aristophanes softens his criticisms but even so it may be only for the sake of punning on agathon name ἁγαθός good that he makes dionysus call him good poet agathon was also friend of euripides another recruit to the court of archelaus of macedon physical appearance agathon extraordinary physical beauty is brought up repeatedly in the sources the historian rhys roberts observes that καλός ἀγάθων ho kalos agathon has become almost stereotyped phrase the most detailed surviving description of agathon is in the in which agathon appears as pale clean shaven young man dressed in women clothes scholars are unsure how much of aristophanes portrayal is fact and how much mere comic invention after close reading of the the historian jane mcintosh snyder observed that agathon costume was almost identical to that of the famous lyric poet anacreon as he is portrayed in early th century vase paintings snyder theorizes that agathon might have made deliberate effort to mimic the sumptuous attire of his famous fellow poet although by agathon time such clothing especially the κεκρύφαλος kekryphalos an elaborate covering for the hair had long fallen out of fashion for men according to this interpretation agathon is mocked in the not only for his notorious effeminacy but also for the pretentiousness of his dress he seems to think of himself in all his elegant finery as rival to the old ionian poets perhaps even to anacreon himself plato epigram agathon has been thought to be the subject of lovers lips an epigram attributed to plato kissing agathon had my soul upon my lips for it rose poor wretch as though to cross over another translation reads kissing agathon found my soul at my lips poor thing it went there hoping to slip across although the authenticity of this epigram was accepted for many centuries it was probably not composed for agathon the tragedian nor was it composed by plato stylistic evidence suggests that the poem with most of plato other alleged epigrams was actually written some time after plato had died its form is that of the hellenistic erotic epigram which did not become popular until after bc according to th century scholar walther ludwig the poems were spuriously inserted into an early biography of plato sometime between bc and bc and adopted by later writers from this source known plays of agathon plays only six titles and thirty one fragments
