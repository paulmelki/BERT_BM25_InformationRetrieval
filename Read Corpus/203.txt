graph of the absolute value function for real numbers the absolute value of number may be thought of as its distance from zero in mathematics the absolute value or modulus of real number denoted is the non negative value of without regard to its sign namely if is positive and if is negative in which case is positive and for example the absolute value of is and the absolute value of is also the absolute value of number may be thought of as its distance from zero generalisations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in wide variety of mathematical settings for example an absolute value is also defined for the complex numbers the quaternions ordered rings fields and vector spaces the absolute value is closely related to the notions of magnitude distance and norm in various mathematical and physical contexts terminology and notation in jean robert argand introduced the term module meaning unit of measure in french specifically for the complex absolute value and it was borrowed into english in as the latin equivalent modulus the term absolute value has been used in this sense from at least in french and in english the notation with vertical bar on each side was introduced by karl weierstrass in other names for absolute value include numerical value and magnitude in programming languages and computational software packages the absolute value of is generally represented by abs or similar expression the vertical bar notation also appears in number of other mathematical contexts for example when applied to set it denotes its cardinality when applied to matrix it denotes its determinant vertical bars denote the absolute value only for algebraic objects for which the notion of an absolute value is defined notably an element of normed division algebra for example real number complex number or quaternion closely related but distinct notation is the use of vertical bars for either the euclidean norm or sup norm of vector in although double vertical bars with subscripts and respectively are more common and less ambiguous notation definition and properties real numbers for any real number the absolute value or modulus of is denoted by vertical bar on each side of the quantity and is defined as the absolute value of is thus always either positive or zero but never negative when itself is negative then its absolute value is necessarily positive from an analytic geometry point of view the absolute value of real number is that number distance from zero along the real number line and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them the notion of an abstract distance function in mathematics can be seen to be generalisation of the absolute value of the difference see distance below since the square root symbol represents the unique positive square root when applied to positive number it follows that is equivalent to the definition above and may be used as an alternative definition of the absolute value of real numbers the absolute value has the following four fundamental properties are real numbers that are used for generalization of this notion to other domains non negativity positive definiteness subadditivity specifically the triangle inequality non negativity positive definiteness and are readily apparent from the definition to see that subadditivity holds first note that one of the two alternatives of taking as either or guarantees that now since and it follows that whichever is the value of one has for all real consequently as desired for generalization of this argument to complex numbers see proof of the triangle inequality for complex numbers below some additional useful properties are given below these are either immediate consequences of the definition or implied by the four fundamental properties above idempotence the absolute value of the absolute value is the absolute value evenness reflection symmetry of the graph identity of indiscernibles equivalent to positive definiteness triangle inequality equivalent to subadditivity if preservation of division equivalent to reverse triangle inequality equivalent to subadditivity two other useful properties concerning inequalities are or these relations may be used to solve inequalities involving absolute values for example the absolute value as distance from zero is used to define the absolute difference between arbitrary real numbers the standard metric on the real numbers complex numbers the absolute value of complex number is the distance of from the origin it is also seen in the picture that and its complex conjugate have the same absolute value since the complex numbers are not ordered the definition given at the top for the real absolute value cannot be directly applied to complex numbers however the geometric interpretation of the absolute value of real number as its distance from can be generalised the absolute value of complex number is defined by the euclidean distance of its corresponding point in the complex plane from the origin this can be computed using the pythagorean theorem for any complex number where and are real numbers the absolute value or modulus of is denoted and is defined by where re and im denote the real and imaginary parts of respectively when the imaginary part is zero this coincides with the definition of the absolute value of the real number when complex number is expressed in its polar form as with and is the argument or phase of its absolute value is since the product of any complex number and its complex conjugate with the same absolute value is always the non negative real number the absolute value of complex number can be conveniently expressed as resembling the alternative definition for reals the complex absolute value shares the four fundamental properties given above for the real absolute value in the language of group theory the multiplicative property may be rephrased as follows the absolute value is group homomorphism from the multiplicative group of the complex numbers onto the group under multiplication of positive real numbers importantly the property of subadditivity triangle inequality extends to any finite collection of complex
