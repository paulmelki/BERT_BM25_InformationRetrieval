an explanation of the superscripts and subscripts seen in atomic number notation atomic number is the number of protons and therefore also the total positive charge in the atomic nucleus the rutherford bohr model of the hydrogen atom or hydrogen like ion in this model it is an essential feature that the photon energy or frequency of the electromagnetic radiation emitted shown when an electron jumps from one orbital to another be proportional to the mathematical square of atomic charge experimental measurement by henry moseley of this radiation for many elements from showed the results as predicted by bohr both the concept of atomic number and the bohr model were thereby given scientific credence the atomic number or proton number symbol of chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of every atom of that element the atomic number uniquely identifies chemical element it is identical to the charge number of the nucleus in an uncharged atom the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons the sum of the atomic number and the number of neutrons gives the mass number of an atom since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes and the mass defect of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass the atomic mass of any atom when expressed in unified atomic mass units making quantity called the relative isotopic mass is within of the whole number atoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers and hence different mass numbers are known as isotopes little more than three quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as mixture of isotopes see monoisotopic elements and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element called the relative atomic mass in defined environment on earth determines the element standard atomic weight historically it was these atomic weights of elements in comparison to hydrogen that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the th century the conventional symbol comes from the german word meaning number which before the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics merely denoted an element numerical place in the periodic table whose order is approximately but not completely consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights only after with the suggestion and evidence that this number was also the nuclear charge and physical characteristic of atoms did the word and its english equivalent atomic number come into common use in this context history the periodic table and natural number for each element russian chemist dmitri mendeleev creator of the periodic table loosely speaking the existence or construction of periodic table of elements creates an ordering of the elements and so they can be numbered in order dmitri mendeleev claimed that he arranged his first periodic tables first published on march in order of atomic weight atomgewicht however in consideration of the elements observed chemical properties he changed the order slightly and placed tellurium atomic weight ahead of iodine atomic weight this placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number but that number was not known or suspected at the time niels bohr creator of the bohr model simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory however besides the case of iodine and tellurium later several other pairs of elements such as argon and potassium cobalt and nickel were known to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights thus requiring their placement in the periodic table to be determined by their chemical properties however the gradual identification of more and more chemically similar lanthanide elements whose atomic number was not obvious led to inconsistency and uncertainty in the periodic numbering of elements at least from lutetium element onward hafnium was not known at this time the rutherford bohr model and van den broek in ernest rutherford gave model of the atom in which central nucleus held most of the atom mass and positive charge which in units of the electron charge was to be approximately equal to half of the atom atomic weight expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms this central charge would thus be approximately half the atomic weight though it was almost different from the atomic number of gold the single element from which rutherford made his guess nevertheless in spite of rutherford estimation that gold had central charge of about but was element on the periodic table month after rutherford paper appeared antonius van den broek first formally suggested that the central charge and number of electrons in an atom was exactly equal to its place in the periodic table also known as element number atomic number and symbolized this proved eventually to be the case moseley experiment henry moseley in his lab the experimental position improved dramatically after research by henry moseley in moseley after discussions with bohr who was at the same lab and who had used van den broek hypothesis in his bohr model of the atom decided to test van den broek and bohr hypothesis directly by seeing if spectral lines emitted from excited atoms fitted the bohr theory postulation that the frequency of the spectral lines be proportional to the square of to do this moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions and lines produced by the elements from aluminum to gold used as series of movable anodic targets inside an ray tube the square root of the frequency of these photons increased from one target to the next in an arithmetic progression this led to the conclusion moseley law that the atomic number does closely correspond with an offset of one unit for lines in moseley work to the calculated electric charge of the nucleus the element number among other things moseley demonstrated that the lanthanide series from lanthanum to lutetium inclusive must have members no fewer and no more which was far from obvious from known chemistry at that time missing
