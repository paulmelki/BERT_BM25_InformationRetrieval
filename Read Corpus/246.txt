germany in as scientific sounding term for jew hatred and this has been its common use since then origin and usage etymology statute of the antisemitic league the origin of antisemitic terminologies is found in the responses of moritz steinschneider to the views of ernest renan as alex bein writes the compound anti semitism appears to have been used first by steinschneider who challenged renan on account of his anti semitic prejudices his derogation of the semites as race avner falk similarly writes the german word antisemitisch was first used in by the austrian jewish scholar moritz steinschneider in the phrase antisemitische vorurteile antisemitic prejudices steinschneider used this phrase to characterise the french philosopher ernest renan false ideas about how semitic races were inferior to aryan races theories concerning race civilization and progress had become quite widespread in europe in the second half of the th century especially as prussian nationalistic historian heinrich von treitschke did much to promote this form of racism he coined the phrase the jews are our misfortune which would later be widely used by nazis according to avner falk treitschke

the jewish spirit over the germanic spirit observed from non religious perspective in which he used the word semitismus interchangeably with the word judentum to denote both jewry the jews as collective and jewishness the quality of being jewish or the jewish spirit this use of semitismus was followed by coining of antisemitismus which was used to indicate opposition to the jews as people and opposition to the jewish spirit which marr interpreted as infiltrating german culture his next pamphlet der weg zum siege des germanenthums über das judenthum the way to victory of the germanic spirit over the jewish spirit presents development of marr ideas further and may present the first published use of the german word antisemitismus antisemitism the pamphlet became very popular and in the same year he founded the antisemiten liga league of antisemites apparently named to follow the anti kanzler liga anti chancellor league the league was the first german organization committed specifically to combating the alleged threat to germany and german culture posed by the jews and their influence and advocating their forced removal from the country so far as can be ascertained the

modern usage semitic designates language group not race in this sense the term is misnomer since there are many speakers of semitic languages arabs ethiopians and arameans who are not the objects of antisemitic prejudices while there are many jews who do not speak hebrew semitic language though antisemitism could be construed as prejudice against people who speak other semitic languages this is
