bast from the tomb of tutankhamun bc egyptian museum cairo alabaster is mineral or rock that is soft often used for carving and is processed for plaster powder archaeologists and the stone processing industry use the word differently from geologists the former use it in wider sense that includes varieties of two different minerals the fine grained massive type of gypsum and the fine grained banded type of calcite geologists define alabaster only as the gypsum type chemically gypsum is hydrous sulfate of calcium while calcite is carbonate of calcium both types of alabaster have similar properties they are usually lightly colored translucent and soft stones they have been used throughout history primarily for carving decorative artifacts the calcite type is also denominated onyx marble egyptian alabaster and oriental alabaster and is geologically described as either compact banded travertine or stalagmitic limestone marked with patterns of swirling bands of cream and brown onyx marble is traditional but geologically inaccurate name because both onyx and marble have geological definitions that are distinct from even the broadest definition of alabaster alabaster bust excluding the head of septimius severus at the musei capitolini rome in general ancient alabaster is calcite in the wider middle east including egypt and mesopotamia while it is gypsum in medieval europe modern alabaster is probably calcite but may be either both are easy to work and slightly soluble in water they have been used for making variety of indoor artwork and carving and they will not survive long outdoors the two kinds are readily distinguished by their different hardnesses gypsum alabaster is so soft that fingernail scratches it mohs hardness to while calcite cannot be scratched in this way mohs hardness although it yields to knife moreover calcite alabaster being carbonate effervesces when treated with hydrochloric acid while gypsum alabaster remains almost unaffected etymology morella spain built th th centuries the origin of alabaster is in middle english through old french alabastre in turn derived from latin alabaster and that from greek ἀλάβαστρος alabastros or ἀλάβαστος alabastos the greek words denoted vase of alabaster the name may be derived further from ancient egyptian labaste which refers to vessels of the egyptian goddess bast she was represented as lioness and frequently depicted as such in figures placed atop these alabaster vessels ancient roman authors pliny the elder and ptolemy wrote that the stone used for ointment jars called alabastra came from region of egypt known as alabastron or alabastrites properties and usability the purest alabaster is snow white material of fine uniform grain but it often is associated with an oxide of iron which produces brown clouding and veining in the stone the coarser varieties of gypsum alabaster are converted by calcination into plaster of paris and are sometimes known as plaster stone the softness of alabaster enables it to be carved readily into elaborate forms but its solubility in water renders it unsuitable for outdoor work if alabaster with smooth polished surface is washed with dishwashing liquid it will become rough dull and whiter losing most of its translucency and lustre the finer kinds of alabaster are employed largely as an ornamental stone especially for ecclesiastical decoration and for the rails of staircases and halls modern processing alabaster workshop in volterra italy working techniques alabaster is mined and then sold in blocks to alabaster workshops there they are cut to the needed size squaring and then are processed in different techniques turned on lathe for round shapes carved into three dimensional sculptures chiselled to produce low relief figures or decoration and then given an elaborate finish that reveals its transparency colour and texture marble imitation in order to diminish the translucency of the alabaster and to produce an opacity suggestive of true marble the statues are immersed in bath of water and heated gradually nearly to the boiling point an operation requiring great care because if the temperature is not regulated carefully the stone acquires dead white chalky appearance the effect of heating appears to be partial dehydration of the gypsum if properly treated it very closely resembles true marble and is known as marmo di castellina dyeing alabaster is porous stone and can be dyed into any colour or shade technique used for centuries for this the stone needs to be fully immersed in various pigmentary solutions and heated to specific temperature the technique can be used to disguise alabaster in this way very misleading imitation of coral that is called alabaster coral is produced types occurrence history calcite alabaster perfume jar from the tomb of tutankhamun bc typically only one type is sculpted in any particular cultural environment but sometimes both have been worked to make similar pieces in the same place and time this was the case with small flasks of the alabastron type made in cyprus from the bronze age into the classical period window panels when cut in thin sheets alabaster is translucent enough to be used for small windows it was used for this purpose in byzantine churches and later in medieval ones especially in italy large sheets of aragonese gypsum alabaster are used extensively in the contemporary cathedral of our lady of the angels which was dedicated in by the los angeles california archdiocese the cathedral incorporates special cooling to prevent the panes from overheating and turning opaque the ancients used the calcite type while the modern los angeles cathedral is using gypsum alabaster there are also multiple examples of alabaster windows in ordinary village churches and monasteries in northern spain calcite alabaster calcite dish from the ancient egyptian tomb of semerkhet calcite alabaster harder than the gypsum variety was the kind primarily used in ancient egypt and the wider middle east but not assyrian palace reliefs and is also used in modern times it is found as either stalagmitic deposit from the floor and walls of limestone caverns or as kind of travertine similarly deposited in springs of calcareous water its deposition in successive layers gives rise to the banded
