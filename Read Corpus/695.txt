ampicillin is an antibiotic used to prevent and treat number of bacterial infections such as respiratory tract infections urinary tract infections meningitis salmonellosis and endocarditis it may also be used to prevent group streptococcal infection in newborns it is used by mouth by injection into muscle or intravenously common side effects include rash nausea and diarrhea it should not be used in people who are allergic to penicillin serious side effects may include clostridium difficile colitis or anaphylaxis while usable in those with kidney problems the dose may need to be decreased its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding appears to be generally safe ampicillin was discovered in and came into commercial use in it is on the world health organization list of essential medicines the world health organization classifies ampicillin as critically important for human medicine it is available as generic medication medical uses diseases bacterial meningitis an aminoglycoside can be added to increase efficacy against gram negative meningitis bacteria endocarditis by enterococcal strains off label use often given with an aminoglycoside infections caused by contaminated water or food for example by salmonella genito urinary tract infections healthcare associated infections that are related to infections from using urinary catheters and that are unresponsive to other medications otitis media middle ear infection prophylaxis to prevent infection in those who previously had rheumatic heart disease or are undergoing dental procedures vaginal hysterectomies or sections it is also used in pregnant woman who are carriers of group streptococci to prevent early onset neonatal infections respiratory infections including bronchitis pharyngitis sinusitis sepsis whooping cough to prevent and treat secondary infections ampicillin used to also be used to treat gonorrhea but there are now too many strains resistant to penicillins bacteria ampicillin is used to treat infections by many gram positive and gram negative bacteria it was the first broad spectrum penicillin with activity against gram positive bacteria including streptococcus pneumoniae streptococcus pyogenes some isolates of staphylococcus aureus but not penicillin resistant or methicillin resistant strains trueperella and some enterococcus it is one of the few antibiotics that works against multidrug resistant enterococcus faecalis and faecium activity against gram negative bacteria includes neisseria meningitidis some haemophilus influenzae and some of the though most and pseudomonas are resistant its spectrum of activity is enhanced by co administration of sulbactam drug that inhibits beta lactamase an enzyme produced by bacteria to inactivate ampicillin and related antibiotics it is sometimes used in combination with other antibiotics that have different mechanisms of action like vancomycin linezolid daptomycin and tigecycline available forms ampicillin can be administered by mouth an intramuscular injection shot or by intravenous infusion the oral form available as capsules or oral suspensions is not given as an initial treatment for severe infections but rather as follow up to an im or iv injection for iv and im injections ampicillin is kept as powder that must be reconstituted iv injections must be given slowly as rapid iv injections can lead to convulsive seizures specific populations ampicillin is one of the most used drugs in pregnancy and has been found to be generally harmless both by the food and drug administration in the which classified it as category and the therapeutic goods administration in australia which classified it as category it is the drug of choice for treating listeria monocytogenes in pregnant women either alone or combined with an aminoglycoside pregnancy increases the clearance of ampicillin by up to and higher dose is thus needed to reach therapeutic levels ampicillin crosses the placenta and remains in the amniotic fluid at of the concentration in maternal plasma this can lead to high concentrations of ampicillin in the newborn while lactating mothers secrete some ampicillin into their breast milk the amount is minimal in newborns ampicillin has longer half life and lower plasma protein binding the clearance by the kidneys is lower as kidney function has not fully developed ampicillin is contraindicated in those with to penicillins as they can cause fatal anaphylactic reactions reactions can include frequent skin rashes and hives exfoliative dermatitis erythema multiforme and temporary decrease in both red and white blood cells ampicillin is not recommended in people with concurrent mononucleosis as over of patients develop skin rash side effects ampicillin is comparatively less toxic than other antibiotics and side effects are more likely in those who are sensitive to penicillins and those with history of asthma or allergies in very rare cases it causes severe side effects such as angioedema anaphylaxis and difficile infection that can range from mild diarrhea to serious colitis some develop black furry tongue serious adverse effects also include seizures and serum sickness the most common side effects experienced by about of users are diarrhea and rash less common side effects can be nausea vomiting itching and blood dyscrasias the effects such as hairy tongue nausea vomiting diarrhea and colitis are more common with the oral form of penicillin other conditions may develop up several weeks after treatment overdose ampicillin overdose can cause behavioral changes confusion blackouts and convulsions as well as neuromuscular electrolyte imbalance and kidney failure interactions ampicillin reacts with probenecid and methotrexate to decrease renal excretion large doses of ampicillin can increase the risk of bleeding with concurrent use of warfarin and other oral anticoagulants possibly by inhibiting platelet aggregation ampicillin has been said to make oral contraceptives less effective but this has been disputed it can be made less effective by other antibiotic such as chloramphenicol erythromycin cephalosporins and tetracyclines for example tetracyclines inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria reducing the target against which ampicillin acts if given at the same time as aminoglycosides it can bind to it and inactivate it when administered separately aminoglycosides and ampicillin can potentiate each other instead ampicillin causes skin rashes more often when given with allopurinol both the live cholera vaccine and live typhoid vaccine can be made ineffective if given with ampicillin ampicillin is normally used to treat cholera and typhoid fever lowering the immunological response that the body has
