territory became divided between the territories claimed by the imperial cities of bern lucerne and solothurn and the swiss canton of unterwalden the remaining portion largely corresponding to the modern canton of aargau remained under the control of the habsburgs until the conquest of aargau by the old swiss confederacy in habsburg castle itself the original seat of the house of habsburg was

known as the unteraargau though can also be called the berner or bernese aargau in bern expanded north into the jura and so came into possession of several strategically important mountain passes into the austrian fricktal this land was added to the unteraargau and was directly ruled from bern it was divided into seven rural bailiwicks and four administrative cities aarau zofingen lenzburg and brugg while the habsburgs were driven out many of their minor nobles were allowed to keep their lands and offices though over time they lost power to the bernese government the bailiwick administration was based on very small staff of officials mostly made up of bernese citizens but with few locals when bern converted during the protestant reformation in the unteraargau also converted at the beginning of the th century number of anabaptists migrated into the upper wynen and rueder valleys from zürich despite pressure from the bernese authorities in the th and th centuries anabaptism never entirely disappeared from the unteraargau bern used the aargau bailiwicks mostly as source of grain for the rest of the city state the administrative cities remained economically only of regional importance however in the th and th centuries bern encouraged industrial development in unteraargau and by the late th century it was the most industrialized region in the city state the
