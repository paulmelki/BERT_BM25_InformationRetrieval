writings in this prompted darwin to publish on the origin of species like darwin wallace did extensive fieldwork first in the amazon river basin and then in the malay archipelago where he identified the faunal divide now termed the wallace line which separates the indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts western portion in which the animals are largely of asian origin and an eastern portion where the fauna reflect australasia he was considered the th century leading expert on the geographical distribution of animal species and is sometimes called the father of biogeography wallace was one of the leading evolutionary thinkers of the th century and made many other contributions to the development of evolutionary theory besides being co discoverer of natural selection these included the concepts of warning colouration in animals and reinforcement sometimes known as the wallace effect hypothesis on how natural selection could contribute to speciation by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation wallace book man place in the universe was the first serious attempt by biologist to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets he was also one of the first scientists to write serious exploration of the subject of whether there was life on mars wallace was strongly attracted to unconventional ideas such as evolution his advocacy of spiritualism and his belief in non material origin for the higher mental faculties of humans strained his relationship with some members of the scientific establishment aside from scientific work he was social activist who was critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and economic system capitalism in th century britain his interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity he was also prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in singapore indonesia and malaysia the malay archipelago was both popular and highly regarded since its publication in it has never been out of print wallace had financial difficulties throughout much of his life his amazon and far eastern trips were supported by the sale of specimens he collected and after he lost most of the considerable money he made from those sales in unsuccessful investments he had to support himself mostly from the publications he produced unlike some of his contemporaries in the british scientific community such as darwin and charles lyell he had no family wealth to fall back on and he was unsuccessful in finding long term salaried position receiving no regular income until he was awarded small government pension through darwin efforts in biography early life alfred wallace was born in the welsh village of llanbadoc near usk monmouthshire he was the eighth of nine children of thomas vere wallace and mary anne greenell mary anne was english thomas wallace was probably of scottish ancestry his family like many wallaces claimed connection to william wallace leader of scottish forces during the wars of scottish independence in the th century thomas wallace graduated in law but never practised law he owned some income generating property but bad investments and failed business ventures resulted in steady deterioration of the family financial position his mother was from middle class english family from hertford north of london when wallace was five years old his family moved to hertford there he attended hertford grammar school until financial difficulties forced his family to withdraw him in when he was aged photograph from wallace autobiography shows the building wallace and his brother john designed and built for the neath mechanics institute wallace then moved to london to board with his older brother john year old apprentice builder this was stopgap measure until william his oldest brother was ready to take him on as an apprentice surveyor while in london alfred attended lectures and read books at the london mechanics institute current birkbeck university of london here he was exposed to the radical

hereford near the welsh border before eventually settling at neath in glamorgan in wales between and wallace did land surveying work in the countryside of the west of england and wales by the end of william business had declined due to difficult economic conditions and wallace at the age of left in january one result of wallace early travels is modern controversy about his nationality since wallace was born in monmouthshire some sources have considered him to be welsh however some historians have questioned this because neither of his parents was welsh his family only briefly lived in monmouthshire the welsh people wallace knew in his childhood considered him to be english and because wallace himself consistently referred to himself as english rather than welsh even when writing about his time in wales one wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore that he was an englishman born in wales after brief period of unemployment he was hired as master at the collegiate school in leicester to teach drawing mapmaking and surveying wallace spent many hours at the library in leicester he read an essay on the principle of population by thomas robert malthus and one evening he met the entomologist henry bates bates was years old and in he had published paper on beetles in the journal zoologist he befriended wallace and started him collecting insects his brother william died in march and wallace left his teaching
