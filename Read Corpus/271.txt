adelaide was established as planned colony of free immigrants promising civil liberties and freedom from religious persecution based upon the ideas of edward gibbon wakefield wakefield had read accounts of australian settlement while in prison in london for attempting to abduct an heiress and realised that the eastern colonies suffered from lack of available labour due to the practice of giving land grants to all arrivals wakefield idea was for the government to survey and sell the land at rate that would maintain land values high enough to be unaffordable for labourers and journeymen funds raised from the sale of land were to be used to bring out working class emigrants who would have to work hard for the monied settlers to ever afford their own land as result of this policy
