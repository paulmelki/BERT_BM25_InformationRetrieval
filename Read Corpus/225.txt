anarcho capitalism is political philosophy and economic theory that advocates the elimination of centralized states in favor of system of private property enforced by private agencies free markets and the right libertarian interpretation of self ownership which extends the concept to include control of private property as part of the self in the absence of statute anarcho capitalists hold that society tends to contractually self regulate and civilize through participation in the free market which they describe as voluntary society anarcho capitalists support wage labour and believe that neither protection of person and property nor victim compensation requires state in theoretical anarcho capitalist society the system of private property would still exist and be enforced by private defense agencies and insurance companies selected by customers which would operate competitively in an open market and fulfill the roles of courts and the police anarcho capitalists claim that various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to anarcho capitalism however anarcho capitalism was developed in the th century and the first person to use the term anarcho capitalism was murray rothbard rothbard synthesized elements from the austrian school classical liberalism and th century american individualist anarchists and mutualists lysander spooner and benjamin tucker while rejecting their labor theory of value and the anti capitalist and socialist norms they derived from it rothbard anarcho capitalist society would operate under mutually agreed upon legal code which would be generally accepted and which the courts would pledge themselves to follow this legal code would recognize contracts private property self ownership and tort law in keeping with the non aggression principle anarcho capitalists are distinguished from anarchists and minarchists the latter advocate night watchman state limited to protecting individuals from aggression and enforcing private property on the other hand anarchists support personal property defined in terms of possession and use mutualist usufruct and oppose capital concentration interest monopoly private ownership of productive property such as the means of production capital land and the means of labor profit rent usury and wage slavery which are viewed as inherent to capitalism anarchism emphasis on anti capitalism egalitarianism and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from anarcho capitalism and other types of economic libertarianism anarcho capitalists are seen by most anarchist schools of thought which reject the notion of capitalism hierarchies and private property as fraudulent and an oxymoron the anti capitalism of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary anarchism philosophy the two principal moral approaches to anarcho capitalism differ in regard to whether anarcho capitalist society is justified on deontological or ethics or both natural law anarcho capitalism as advocated by murray rothbard holds that universal system of rights can be derived from natural law other anarcho capitalists do not rely upon the idea of natural rights and present economic justifications for free market capitalist society this latter approach has been offered by david friedman in the machinery of freedom unlike other anarcho capitalists most notably rothbard friedman has never tried to deny the theoretical cogency of the neoclassical literature on market failure but he openly applies the theory to both market and government institutions to compare the net result nor has he been inclined to attack economic efficiency as normative benchmark john kosanke sees such debate as irrelevant kosanke believes that in the absence of statutory law the non aggression principle is naturally enforced because individuals are automatically held accountable for their actions via tort and contract law kosanke also argues that communities of sovereign individuals naturally expel aggressors in the same way that ethical business practices are allegedly naturally required among competing businesses that are subject to what he describes as the discipline of the marketplace for kosanke the only thing that needs to be debated is the nature of the contractual mechanism that abolishes the state or prevents it from coming into existence where new communities form on the state anarcho capitalists see capitalism and the free market as the basis for free and prosperous society murray rothbard who is credited with coining the term anarcho capitalism stated that the difference between free market capitalism and state capitalism is the difference between peaceful voluntary exchange and collusive partnership between business and government that uses coercion to subvert the free market anarchists view capitalism as an inherently authoritarian and hierarchical system and seek the abolishment of private property there is disagreement between anarchists and anarcho capitalists as the former generally rejects anarcho capitalism as form of anarchism and considers anarcho capitalism an oxymoron while the latter holds that the abolishment of private property would require expropriation which is to order and would require state in their opinion rothbard argued that all government services including defense are inefficient because they lack market based pricing mechanism regulated by the voluntary decisions of consumers purchasing services that fulfill their highest priority needs and by investors seeking the most profitable enterprises to invest in many anarcho capitalists also argue that private defense and court agencies would have to have good reputation in order to stay in business furthermore linda and morris tannehill argue that no coercive monopoly of force can arise on truly free market and that government citizenry can not desert them in favor of competent protection and defense agency rothbard stated that he based his philosophy on natural law grounds and provided economic explanations of why he thinks anarcho capitalism is preferable on pragmatic grounds as well david friedman says that he is not an absolutist rights theorist but he is also not utilitarian however friedman believes that utilitarian arguments are usually the best way to defend libertarian views peter leeson argues that the case for anarchy derives its strength from empirical evidence not theory hans hermann hoppe uses argumentation ethics for his foundation of private property anarchism which is closer to rothbard natural law approach rothbard wrote rothbard used the term anarcho capitalism to distinguish his philosophy from anarchism that opposes private property as well as to distinguish it from other forms of
