the aorta is the main and largest artery in the human body originating from the left ventricle of the heart and extending down to the abdomen where it splits into two smaller arteries the common iliac arteries the aorta distributes oxygenated blood to all parts of the body through the systemic circulation structure sections course of the aorta in the thorax anterior view starting posterior to the main pulmonary artery then anterior to the right pulmonary arteries the trachea and the esophagus then turning posteriorly to course dorsally to these structures in anatomical sources the aorta is usually divided into sections one way of classifying part of the aorta is by anatomical compartment where the thoracic aorta or thoracic portion of the aorta runs from the heart to the diaphragm the aorta then continues downward as the abdominal aorta or abdominal portion of the aorta from the diaphragm to the aortic bifurcation another system divides the aorta with respect to its course and the direction of blood flow in this system the aorta starts as the ascending aorta travels superiorly from the heart and then makes hairpin turn known as the aortic arch following the aortic arch the aorta then travels inferiorly as the descending aorta the descending aorta has two parts the aorta begins to descend in the thoracic cavity and is consequently known as the thoracic aorta after the aorta passes through the diaphragm it is known as the abdominal aorta the aorta ends by dividing into two major blood vessels the common iliac arteries and smaller midline vessel the median sacral artery ascending aorta the ascending aorta begins at the opening of the aortic valve in the left ventricle of the heart it runs through common pericardial sheath with the pulmonary trunk these two blood vessels twist around each other causing the aorta to start out posterior to the pulmonary trunk but end by twisting to its right and anterior side the transition from ascending aorta to aortic arch is at the pericardial reflection on the aorta at the root of the ascending aorta the lumen has three small pockets between the cusps of the aortic valve and the wall of the aorta which are called the aortic sinuses or the sinuses of valsalva the left aortic sinus contains the origin of the left coronary artery and the right aortic sinus likewise gives rise to the right coronary artery together these two arteries supply the heart the posterior aortic sinus does not give rise to coronary artery for this reason the left right and posterior aortic sinuses are also called left coronary right coronary and non coronary sinuses aortic arch the aortic arch loops over the left pulmonary artery and the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk to which it remains connected by the ligamentum arteriosum remnant of the fetal circulation that is obliterated few days after birth in addition to these blood vessels the aortic arch crosses the left main bronchus between the aortic arch and the pulmonary trunk is network of autonomic nerve fibers the cardiac plexus or aortic plexus the left vagus nerve which passes anterior to the aortic arch gives off major branch the recurrent laryngeal nerve which loops under the aortic arch just lateral to the ligamentum arteriosum it then runs back to the neck the aortic arch has three major branches from proximal to distal they are the brachiocephalic trunk the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery the brachiocephalic trunk supplies the right side of the head and neck as well as the right arm and chest wall while the latter two together supply the left side of the same regions the aortic arch ends and the descending aorta begins at the level of the intervertebral disc between the fourth and fifth thoracic vertebrae thoracic aorta the thoracic descending aorta gives rise to the intercostal and subcostal arteries as well as to the superior and inferior left bronchial arteries and variable branches to the esophagus mediastinum and pericardium its lowest pair of branches are the superior phrenic arteries which supply the diaphragm and the subcostal arteries for the twelfth rib abdominal aorta the abdominal aorta begins at the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm at the level of the twelfth thoracic vertebra it gives rise to lumbar and musculophrenic arteries renal and middle suprarenal arteries and visceral arteries the celiac trunk the superior mesenteric artery and the inferior mesenteric artery it ends in bifurcation into the left and right common iliac arteries at the point of the bifurcation there also springs smaller branch the median sacral artery development the ascending aorta develops from the outflow tract which initially starts as single tube connecting the heart with the aortic arches which will form the great arteries in early development but is then separated into the aorta and the pulmonary trunk the aortic arches start as five pairs of symmetrical arteries connecting the heart with the dorsal aorta and then undergo significant remodelling to form the final asymmetrical structure of the great arteries with the rd pair of arteries contributing to the common carotids the right th forming the base and middle part of the right subclavian artery and the left th being the central part of the aortic arch the smooth muscle of the great arteries and the population of cells that form the septum that separates the aorta and pulmonary artery is derived from cardiac neural crest this contribution of the neural crest to the great artery smooth muscle is unusual as most smooth muscle is derived from mesoderm in fact the smooth muscle within the abdominal aorta is derived from mesoderm and the coronary arteries which arise just above the semilunar valves possess smooth muscle of mesodermal origin failure of the septum to divide the great vessels results in persistent truncus arteriosus microanatomy pig aorta cut open also showing some branching arteries the aorta is an elastic artery and as such is quite distensible the aorta consists of heterogeneous
