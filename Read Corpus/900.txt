two american tank destroyers in belgium during world war ii tank destroyer tank hunter or tank killer is type of armoured fighting vehicle armed with direct fire artillery gun or missile launcher designed specifically to engage and destroy enemy tanks often with limited operational capacities tanks are armoured fighting vehicles designed for front line combat combining operational mobility and tactical offensive and defensive capabilities tanks perform all primary tasks of the armoured troops the tank destroyer on the other hand is specifically designed to take on enemy tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles many are based on tracked tank chassis while others are wheeled since world war ii gun armed powerful tank destroyers have fallen out of favor as armies have favored multirole main battle tanks however lightly armored anti tank guided missile atgm carriers are commonly used for supplementary long range anti tank work the resurgence of expeditionary warfare in the first two decades of the st century has seen the emergence of gun armed wheeled vehicles sometimes called protected gun systems which may bear superficial resemblance to tank destroyers but are employed as direct fire support units typically providing support in low intensity operations such as the wars in iraq and afghanistan th century world war ii dedicated anti tank vehicles made their first major appearance in the second world war as combatants developed effective armored vehicles and tactics some were little more than stopgap solutions mounting an anti tank gun on tracked vehicle to give mobility while others were more sophisticated designs an example of the development of tank destroyer technology throughout the war are the marder iii and jagdpanzer vehicle that were very different in spite of being based on the same chassis marder was an anti tank gun on tracks whereas the jagdpanzer traded some firepower its pak designed to operate within the confines of fully armored fighting compartment fires the same projectiles from reduced propellant charge compared to marder pak for better armor protection and ease of concealment on the battlefield except for most american designs tank destroyers were all turretless and had fixed or casemate superstructures when tank destroyer was used against enemy tanks from defensive position such as by ambush the common lack of rotating turret was not particularly critical while the lower silhouette was highly desirable the turretless design allowed accommodation of more powerful gun typically dedicated anti tank gun in lieu of regular tank general purpose main gun that fired both anti tank and high explosive ammunition that had longer barrel than could be mounted in turreted tank on the same chassis the lack of turret increased the vehicle internal volume allowing for increased ammunition stowage and crew comfort eliminating the turret let the vehicle carry thicker armor and also let this armour be concentrated in the hull sometimes there was no armored roof only weather cover to keep the overall weight down to the limit that the chassis could bear the absence of turret meant that tank destroyers could be manufactured significantly cheaper faster and more easily than the tanks on which they were based and they found particular favor when production resources were lacking after hard lessons early in the war machine guns were mounted for use against infantry but the limited traverse of the mounting meant that they were still less effective than those used on turreted tanks poland variants of the polish tks and tk tankettes up armed with mm gun vehicles were operationally deployed in the invasion of poland they were used as an anti tank component of the reconnaissance units france due to the quick defeat of france few french vehicles were built the laffly tcc chasseur de char was an attempt to quickly build light tank destroyer by mounting mm sa anti tank gun onto lightly armored laffly artillery tractor other french tank destroyers were being developed including the somua sau arl and various ad hoc conversions of the lorraine germany panzerjäger the first german tank destroyers were the panzerjäger tank hunters which mounted an existing anti tank gun on convenient chassis for mobility usually with just three sided gun shield for crew protection for instance obsolete panzer light tanks were modified by removing the turret and were rebuilt as the panzerjäger self propelled cm pak similarly panzer ii tanks were used on the eastern front captured soviet anti tank guns were mounted on modified panzer ii chassis producing the marder ii self propelled anti tank gun the most common mounting was german anti tank gun on the czech panzer chassis to produce the marder iii the panzer chassis was also used to make the jagdpanzer casemate style tank destroyer the panzerjäger series continued up to the equipped nashorn sturmgeschütz iii german tank destroyers based on the panzer iii and later german tanks were unique in that they had more armor than their tank counterparts one of the more successful german tank destroyers was actually designed as self propelled artillery gun the sturmgeschütz iii based on the panzer iii tank chassis the sturmgeschütz iii was originally fitted with low velocity gun and was assigned to the artillery arm for infantry fire support later after encountering soviet tanks it was refitted with comparatively short barreled high velocity anti tank gun usually with muzzle brake enabling it to function as tank destroyer the sturmgeschütz iii from its origin used new casemate style superstructure with an integrated design similar to the later jagdpanzer vehicle designs superstructure to completely enclose the crew it was employed in infantry support and offensive armored operations as well as in the defensive anti tank role the stug iii assault gun was germany most produced fully tracked armoured fighting vehicle during world war ii and second most produced german armored combat vehicle of any type after the sd kfz half track jagdpanther although the early german panzerjäger carried more effective weapons than the tanks on which they were based they were generally lacking in protection for the crew having thinly armored open
