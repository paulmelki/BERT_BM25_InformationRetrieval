wood metal eutectic low melting point alloy of bismuth lead tin and cadmium individual grains are seen as the flat surfaces of the crystals an alloy is combination of metals or metals combined with one or more other elements for example combining the metallic elements gold and copper produces red gold gold and silver becomes white gold and silver combined with copper produces sterling silver elemental iron combined with non metallic carbon or silicon produces alloys called steel or silicon steel the resulting mixture forms substance with properties that often differ from those of the pure metals such as increased strength or hardness unlike other substances that may contain metallic bases but do not behave as metals such as aluminium oxide sapphire beryllium aluminium silicate emerald or sodium chloride salt an alloy will retain all the properties of metal in the resulting material such as electrical conductivity ductility opaqueness and luster alloys are used in wide variety of applications from the steel alloys used in everything from buildings to automobiles to surgical tools to exotic titanium alloys used in the aerospace industry to beryllium copper alloys for non sparking tools in some cases combination of metals may reduce the overall cost of the material while preserving important properties in other cases the combination of metals imparts synergistic properties to the constituent metal elements such as corrosion resistance or mechanical strength examples of alloys are steel solder brass pewter duralumin bronze and amalgams an alloy may be solid solution of metal elements single phase where all metallic grains crystals are of the same composition or mixture of metallic phases two or more solutions forming microstructure of different crystals within the metal intermetallic compounds are alloys with defined stoichiometry and crystal structure zintl phases are also sometimes considered alloys depending on bond types see van arkel ketelaar triangle for information on classifying bonding in binary compounds alloys are defined by metallic bonding character the alloy constituents are usually measured by mass percentage for practical applications and in atomic fraction for basic science studies alloys are usually classified as substitutional or interstitial alloys depending on the atomic arrangement that forms the alloy they can be further classified as homogeneous consisting of single phase or heterogeneous consisting of two or more phases or intermetallic introduction liquid bronze being poured into molds during casting brass lamp an alloy is mixture of chemical elements which forms an impure substance admixture that retains the characteristics of metal an alloy is distinct from an impure metal in that with an alloy the added elements are well controlled to produce desirable properties while impure metals such as wrought iron are less controlled but are often considered useful alloys are made by mixing two or more elements at least one of which is metal this is usually called the primary metal or the base metal and the name of this metal may also be the name of the alloy the other constituents may or may not be metals but when mixed with the molten base they will be soluble and dissolve into the mixture the mechanical properties of alloys will often be quite different from those of its individual constituents metal that is normally very soft malleable such as aluminium can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal such as copper although both metals are very soft and ductile the resulting aluminium alloy will have much greater strength adding small amount of non metallic carbon to iron trades its great ductility for the greater strength of an alloy called steel due to its very high strength but still substantial toughness and its ability to be greatly altered by heat treatment steel is one of the most useful and common alloys in modern use by adding chromium to steel its resistance to corrosion can be enhanced creating stainless steel while adding silicon will alter its electrical characteristics producing silicon steel like oil and water molten metal may not always mix with another element for example pure iron is almost completely insoluble with copper even when the constituents are soluble each will usually have saturation point beyond which no more of the constituent can be added iron for example can hold maximum of carbon although the elements of an alloy usually must be soluble in the liquid state they may not always be soluble in the solid state if the metals remain soluble when solid the alloy forms solid solution becoming homogeneous structure consisting of identical crystals called phase if as the mixture cools the constituents become insoluble they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals creating heterogeneous microstructure of different phases some with more of one constituent than the other however in other alloys the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization occurs if cooled very quickly they first crystallize as homogeneous phase but they are supersaturated with the secondary constituents as time passes the atoms of these supersaturated alloys can separate from the crystal lattice becoming more stable and forming second phase that serves to reinforce the crystals internally some alloys such as electrum an alloy of silver and gold occur naturally meteorites are sometimes made of naturally occurring alloys of iron and nickel but are not native to the earth one of the first alloys made by humans was bronze which is mixture of the metals tin and copper bronze was an extremely useful alloy to the ancients because it is much stronger and harder than either of its components steel was another common alloy however in ancient times it could only be created as an accidental byproduct from the heating of iron ore in fires smelting during the manufacture of iron other ancient alloys include pewter brass and pig iron in the modern age steel can be created in many forms carbon steel can be made by varying only the carbon content producing soft alloys like mild steel or hard alloys like spring steel alloy steels can be made by adding
