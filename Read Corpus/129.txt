austrian german austrian standard german asg standard austrian german or austrian high german is the variety of standard german written and spoken in austria it has the highest sociolinguistic prestige locally as it is the variation used in the media and for other formal situations in less formal situations austrians tend to use forms closer to or identical with the bavarian and alemannic dialects traditionally spoken but rarely written in austria history austrian german has its beginning in the mid th century when empress maria theresa and her son joseph ii introduced compulsory schooling in and several reforms of administration in their multilingual habsburg empire at the time the written standard was oberdeutsche schreibsprache upper german written language which was highly influenced by the bavarian and alemannic dialects of austria another option was to create new standard based on the southern german dialects as proposed by the linguist johann siegmund popowitsch instead they decided for pragmatic reasons to adopt the already standardized chancellery language of saxony sächsische kanzleisprache or meißner kanzleideutsch which was based on the administrative language of the non austrian area of meißen and dresden thus standard austrian german has the same geographic origin as the german standard german bundesdeutsches hochdeutsch and swiss high german schweizer hochdeutsch not to be confused with the alemannic swiss german dialects the process of introducing the new written standard was led by joseph von sonnenfels since the standardized form of austrian german for official texts and schools has been defined by the austrian dictionary published under the authority of the austrian federal ministry of education arts and culture general situation of german as german is pluricentric language austrian german is one among several varieties of standard german much like the relationship between british english and american english the german varieties differ in minor respects spelling word usage and grammar but are recognizably equivalent and largely mutually intelligible standard german in austria the official austrian dictionary das österreichische wörterbuch prescribes grammatical and spelling rules defining the official language austrian delegates participated in the international working group that drafted the german spelling reform of several conferences leading up to the reform were hosted in vienna at the invitation of the austrian federal government and adopted it as signatory along with germany switzerland and liechtenstein of an international memorandum of understanding signed in vienna in the sharp is used in austria as in germany an austrian primary school handwriting style sign in vienna pedestrian is in germany in all caps words capital instead of ss became standard in both nations in but ss remains valid because of the german language pluricentric nature german dialects in austria should not be confused with the variety of standard german spoken by most austrians which is distinct from that of germany or switzerland distinctions in vocabulary persist for example in culinary terms where communication with germans is frequently difficult and administrative and legal language which is due to austria exclusion from the development of german nation state in the late th century and its manifold particular traditions comprehensive collection of austrian german legal administrative and economic terms is offered in markhardt heidemarie wörterbuch der rechts wirtschafts und peter lang former spoken standard the former standard used for about years or more in speech in refined language was the sociolect spoken by the imperial habsburg family and the nobility of austria hungary it differed from other dialects in vocabulary and pronunciation it appears to have been spoken with slight degree of nasality this was not standard in modern technical sense as it was just the social standard of upper class speech special written forms for many years austria had special form of the language for official government documents this form is known as or austrian chancellery language it is very traditional form of the language probably derived from medieval deeds and documents and has very complex structure and vocabulary generally reserved for such documents for most speakers even native speakers this form of the language is generally difficult to understand as it contains many highly specialised terms for diplomatic internal official and military matters there are no regional variations because this special written form has mainly been used by government that has now for centuries been based in vienna is now used less and less thanks to various administrative reforms that reduced the number of traditional civil servants as result standard german is replacing it in government and administrative texts european union when austria became member of the european union food related terms were listed in its accession agreement as having the same legal status as the equivalent terms used in germany for example the words for potato tomato and brussels sprouts examples in vocabulary austrian german is the only variety of pluricentric language recognized under international law or eu primary law grammar verbs in austria as in the german speaking parts of switzerland and in southern germany verbs that express state tend to use as the auxiliary verb in the perfect as well as verbs of movement verbs which fall into this category include sitzen to sit liegen to lie and in parts of carinthia schlafen to sleep therefore the perfect of these verbs would be ich bin gesessen ich bin gelegen and ich bin geschlafen respectively in germany the words stehen to stand and gestehen to confess are identical in the present perfect habe gestanden the austrian variant avoids this potential ambiguity bin gestanden from stehen to stand and habe gestanden from gestehen to confess der verbrecher ist vor dem richter gestanden und hat gestanden in addition the preterite simple past is very rarely used in austria especially in the spoken language with the exception of some modal verbs ich sollte ich wollte vocabulary there are many official terms that differ in austrian german from their usage in most parts of germany words used in austria are jänner january rather than januar feber seldom february along with februar heuer this year along with dieses jahr stiege stairs along
