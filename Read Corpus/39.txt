harvesting wheat with combine harvester accompanied by tractor and trailer agriculture is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities the history of agriculture began thousands of years ago after gathering wild grains beginning at least years ago nascent farmers began to plant them around years ago pigs sheep and cattle were domesticated over years ago plants were independently cultivated in at least regions of the world industrial agriculture based on large scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output though about billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture into the twenty first modern agronomy plant breeding agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers and technological developments have sharply increased yields while causing widespread ecological and environmental damage selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage environmental issues include contributions to global warming depletion of aquifers deforestation antibiotic resistance and growth hormones in industrial meat production genetically modified organisms are widely used although some are banned in certain countries the major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods fibers fuels and raw materials such as rubber food classes include cereals grains vegetables fruits oils meat milk fungi and eggs over one third of the world workers are employed in agriculture second only to the service sector although the number of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the centuries etymology and scope the word agriculture is late middle english adaptation of latin agricultūra from ager field and cultūra cultivation or growing while agriculture usually refers to human activities certain species of ant termite and beetle have been cultivating crops for up to million years agriculture is defined with varying scopes in its broadest sense using natural resources to produce commodities which maintain life including food fiber forest products horticultural crops and their related services thus defined it includes arable farming horticulture animal husbandry and forestry but horticulture and forestry are in practice often excluded history centres of origin as numbered by nikolai vavilov in the area gray is no longer recognised as centre of origin and papua new guinea area orange was identified more recently origins han dynasty tomb brick showing workers rice husking the development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe and included diverse range of taxa in at least separate centres of origin wild grains were collected and eaten from at least years ago from around years ago the eight neolithic founder crops emmer and einkorn wheat hulled barley peas lentils bitter vetch chick peas and flax were cultivated in the levant rice was domesticated in china between and bc with the earliest known cultivation from bc followed by mung soy and azuki beans sheep were domesticated in mesopotamia between and years ago cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern turkey and pakistan some years ago pig production emerged in eurasia including europe east asia and southwest asia where wild boar were first domesticated about years ago in the andes of south america the potato was domesticated between and years ago along with beans coca llamas alpacas and guinea pigs sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in new guinea around years ago sorghum was domesticated in the sahel region of africa by years ago cotton was domesticated in peru by years ago and was independently domesticated in eurasia in mesoamerica wild teosinte was bred into maize by years ago scholars have offered multiple hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture studies of the transition from hunter gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism examples are the natufian culture in the levant and the early chinese neolithic in china then wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted and gradually came to be domesticated civilizations agricultural scenes of threshing grain store harvesting with sickles digging tree cutting and ploughing from ancient egypt tomb of nakht th century bc in eurasia the sumerians started to live in villages from about bc relying on the tigris and euphrates rivers and canal system for irrigation ploughs appear in pictographs around bc seed ploughs around bc farmers grew wheat barley vegetables such as lentils and onions and fruits including dates grapes and figs ancient egyptian agriculture relied on the nile river and its seasonal flooding farming started in the predynastic period at the end of the paleolithic after bc staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley alongside industrial crops such as flax and papyrus in india wheat barley and jujube were domesticated by bc soon followed by sheep and goats cattle sheep and goats were domesticated in mehrgarh culture by bc cotton was cultivated by the th th millennium bc archeological evidence indicates an animal drawn plough from bc in the indus valley civilisation in china from the th century bc there was nationwide granary system and widespread silk farming water powered grain mills were in use by the st century bc followed by irrigation by the late nd century heavy ploughs had been developed with iron ploughshares and mouldboards these spread westwards across eurasia asian rice was domesticated years ago depending on the molecular clock estimate that is used on the pearl river in southern china with single genetic origin from the wild rice oryza rufipogon in greece and rome the major cereals were wheat emmer and barley alongside vegetables including peas beans and olives sheep and goats were kept mainly for dairy products in the americas crops domesticated in mesoamerica apart from teosinte include squash beans and cocoa cocoa was being domesticated by the mayo chinchipe of the upper amazon
