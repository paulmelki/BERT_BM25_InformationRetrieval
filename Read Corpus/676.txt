iii and antipope victor iv absalon stayed loyal to valdemar even as he joined the holy roman emperor frederick barbarossa in supporting victor iv this caused split within the danish church as it possibly forced eskil into exile around despite abaslon attempts to keep the danish church united it was contrary to absalon advice and warnings that valdemar rendered fealty to the emperor frederick barbarossa at dole in
