perseid meteor shower amateur astronomy is hobby where participants enjoy observing or imaging celestial objects in the sky using the unaided eye binoculars or telescopes even though scientific research may not be their primary goal some amateur astronomers make contributions in doing citizen science such as by monitoring variable stars double stars sunspots or occultations of stars by the moon or asteroids or by discovering transient astronomical events such as comets galactic novae or supernovae in other galaxies amateur astronomers do not use the field of astronomy as their primary source of income or support and usually have no professional degree in astrophysics or advanced academic training in the subject most amateurs are hobbyists while others have high degree of experience in astronomy and may often assist and work alongside professional astronomers many astronomers have studied the sky throughout history in an amateur framework however since the beginning of the twentieth century professional astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from amateur astronomy and associated activities amateur astronomers typically view the sky at night when most celestial objects and astronomical events are visible but others observe during the daytime by viewing the sun and solar eclipses some just look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes or binoculars but more dedicated amateurs often use portable telescopes or telescopes situated in their private or club observatories amateurs can also join as members of amateur astronomical societies which can advise educate or guide them towards ways of finding and observing celestial objects they can also promote the science of astronomy among the general public objectives an image of the cat paw nebula created combining the work of professional and amateur astronomers the image is the combination of the metre mpg eso telescope of the la silla observatory in chile and meter amateur telescope collectively amateur astronomers observe variety of celestial objects and phenomena common targets of amateur astronomers include the sun the moon planets stars comets meteor showers and variety of deep sky objects such as star clusters galaxies and nebulae many amateurs like to specialise in observing particular objects types of objects or types of events which interest them one branch of amateur astronomy amateur involves the taking of photos of the night sky has become more popular with the introduction of far easier to use equipment including digital cameras dslr cameras and relatively sophisticated purpose built high quality ccd cameras most amateur astronomers work at visible wavelengths but small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum an early pioneer of radio astronomy was grote reber an amateur astronomer who constructed the first purpose built radio telescope in the late to follow up on the discovery of radio wavelength emissions from space by karl jansky non visual amateur astronomy includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes and also the use of radio telescopes some amateur astronomers use home made radio telescopes while others use radio telescopes that were originally built for astronomical research but have since been made available for use by amateurs the one mile telescope is one such example common tools places like paranal observatory offer crystal clear skies for observing astronomical objects with or without instruments amateur astronomers use range of instruments to study the sky depending on combination of their interests and resources methods include simply looking at the night sky with the naked eye using binoculars and using variety of optical telescopes of varying power and quality as well as additional sophisticated equipment such as cameras to study light from the sky in both the visual and non visual parts of the spectrum commercial telescopes are available new and used but it is also common for amateur astronomers to build or commission the building of their own custom telescopes some people even focus on amateur telescope making as their primary interest within the hobby of amateur astronomy although specialized and experienced amateur astronomers tend to acquire more specialized and more powerful equipment over time relatively simple equipment is often preferred for certain tasks binoculars for instance although generally of lower power than the majority of telescopes also tend to provide wider field of view which is preferable for looking at some objects in the night sky amateur astronomers also use star charts that depending on experience and intentions may range from simple planispheres through to detailed charts of very specific areas of the night sky range of astronomy software is available and used by amateur astronomers including software that generates maps of the sky software to assist with observation scheduling software and software to perform various calculations pertaining to astronomical phenomena amateur astronomers often like to keep records of their observations which usually takes the form of an observing log observing logs typically record details about which objects were observed and when as well as describing the details that were seen sketching is sometimes used within logs and photographic records of observations have also been used in recent times the information gathered is used to help studies and interactions between amateur astronomers in yearly gatherings although not professional information or credible it is way for the hobby lovers to share their new sightings and experiences the popularity of imaging among amateurs has led to large numbers of web sites being written by individuals about their images and equipment much of the social interaction of amateur astronomy occurs on mailing lists or discussion groups discussion group servers host numerous astronomy lists great deal of the commerce of amateur astronomy the buying and selling of equipment occurs online many amateurs use online tools to plan their nightly observing sessions using tools such as the clear sky chart common techniques while number of interesting celestial objects are readily identified by the naked eye sometimes with the aid of star chart many others are so faint or inconspicuous that technical means are necessary to locate them although many methods are used in amateur astronomy most are variations of few specific techniques star hopping star hopping
