ad hominem short for argumentum ad hominem is term that refers to several types of arguments most of which are fallacious typically this term refers to rhetorical strategy where the speaker attacks the character motive or some other attribute of the person making an argument rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself this avoids genuine debate by creating diversion to some irrelevant but often highly charged issue the most common form of this fallacy is makes claim asserts that holds property that is unwelcome and hence concludes that argument is wrong the valid types of ad hominem arguments are generally only encountered in specialized philosophical usage these typically refer to the dialectical strategy of using the target own beliefs and arguments against them while not agreeing with the validity of those beliefs and arguments ad hominem arguments were first studied in ancient greece john locke revived the examination of ad hominem arguments in the th century many contemporary politicians routinely use ad hominem attacks which can be encapsulated to derogatory nickname for political opponent history aristotle bc was the first philosopher who distinguished arguments attacking thesis or attacking other persons the various types of ad hominem arguments have been known in the west since at least the ancient greeks aristotle in his work sophistical refutations detailed the fallaciousness of putting the questioner but not the argument under scrutiny many examples of ancient non fallacious ad hominem arguments are preserved in the works of the pyrrhonist philosopher sextus empiricus in these arguments the concepts and assumptions of the opponents are used as part of dialectical strategy against the opponents to demonstrate the unsoundness of their own arguments and assumptions in this way the arguments are to the person ad hominem but without attacking the properties of the individuals making the arguments this kind of argument is also known as argument from commitment italian polymath galileo galilei and british philosopher john locke also examined the argument from commitment form of the ad hominem argument meaning examining an argument on the basis of whether it stands true to the principles of the person carrying the argument in the mid th century the modern understanding of the term ad hominem started to take shape with the broad definition given by english logician richard whately according to whately ad hominem arguments were addressed to the peculiar circumstances character avowed opinions or past conduct of the individual over time the term acquired different meaning by the beginning of the th century it was linked to logical fallacy in which debater instead of disproving an argument attacked their opponent this approach was also popularized in philosophical textbooks of the mid th century and it was challenged by australian philosopher charles leonard hamblin in the second half of the th century in detailed work he suggested that the inclusion of statement against person in an argument does not necessarily make it fallacious argument since that particular phrase is not premise that leads to conclusion while hablin criticism was not widely accepted canadian philosopher douglas walton examined the fallaciousness of the ad hominem argument even further nowadays except within specialized philosophical usages the usage of the term ad hominem signifies straight attack at the character and ethos of person in an attempt to refute their argument terminology the latin phase argumentum ad hominem stands for argument against the person ad corresponds to against but it could also mean to or towards the terms ad mulierem and ad feminam have been used specifically when the person receiving the criticism is female types of ad hominem arguments fallacious ad hominem reasoning is categorized among informal fallacies more precisely as genetic fallacy subcategory of fallacies of irrelevance ad hominem fallacies can be separated in various different types among others are tu quoque circumstantial guilt by association and abusive ad hominem all of them are similar to the general scheme of ad hominem argument that is instead of dealing with the essence of someone argument or trying to refute it the interlocutor is attacking the character of the proponent of the argument and concluding that it is sufficient reason to drop the initial argument tu quoque ad hominem tu quoque literally you also is response to personal attack or ad hominem argument that itself is personal attack tu quoque appears as makes claim attacks the character of by saying they hold property which is bad defends themself by attacking saying they also hold the same property here is an example given by philosophy professor george wrisley to illustrate the above businessman and politician is giving lecture at university about how good his company is and how nicely the system works student asks him is it true that you and your company are selling weapons to third world rulers who use those arms against their own people and the businessman replies is it true that your university gets funding by the same company that you are claiming is selling guns to those countries you are not white dove either the ad hominem accusation of the student is relevant to the narrative the businessman tries to project thus not fallacious on the other hand the attack on the student that is the student being inconsistent is irrelevant to the opening narrative so the businessman tu quoque response is fallacious canadian philosopher christopher tindale approaches somewhat different the tu quoque fallacy according to tindale tu quoque fallacy appears when response to an argument is made on the history of the arguer this argument is also invalid because it does not disprove the premise if the premise is true then source may be hypocrite or even changed their mind but this does not make the statement less credible from logical perspective common example given by tindale is when doctor advises patient to lose weight but the patient argues that there is no need for him to go on diet because the doctor is also overweight circumstantial circumstantial ad hominem points out that someone is in
