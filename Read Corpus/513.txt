philosopher and the most celebrated of the ancient greek commentators on the writings of aristotle he was native of aphrodisias in caria and lived and taught in athens at the beginning of the rd century where he held position as head of the peripatetic school he wrote many commentaries on the works of aristotle extant are those on the prior analytics topics meteorology sense and sensibilia and metaphysics several original treatises also survive and include work on fate in which he argues against the stoic doctrine of necessity and one on the soul his commentaries on aristotle were considered so useful that he was styled by way of pre eminence the commentator life and career alexander was native of aphrodisias in caria present day turkey and came to athens towards the end of the nd century he was student of the two stoic or possibly peripatetic philosophers sosigenes and herminus and perhaps of aristotle of mytilene at athens he became head of the peripatetic school and lectured on peripatetic philosophy alexander dedication of on fate to septimius severus and caracalla in gratitude for his position at athens indicates date between and recently published inscription from aphrodisias confirms that he was head of one of the schools at athens and gives his full name as titus aurelius alexander his full nomenclature shows that his grandfather or other ancestor was probably given roman citizenship by the emperor antoninus pius while proconsul of asia the inscription honours his father also called alexander and also philosopher this fact makes it plausible that some of the suspect works that form part of alexander corpus should be ascribed to his father commentaries commentaria in analytica priora aristotelis andrea briosco aristotle and alexander of aphrodisias th century plaquette bode museum commentaria in meteorologica aristotelis alexander composed several commentaries on the works of aristotle in which he sought to escape syncretistic tendency and to recover the pure doctrines of aristotle his extant commentaries are on prior analytics book topics meteorology sense and sensibilia and metaphysics books the commentary on the sophistical refutations is deemed spurious as is the commentary on the final nine books of the metaphysics the lost commentaries include works on the de interpretatione posterior analytics physics on the heavens on generation and corruption on the soul and on memory simplicius of cilicia mentions that alexander provided commentary on the quadrature of the lunes and the corresponding problem of squaring the circle in april it was reported that imaging analysis had discovered an early commentary on aristotle categories in the archimedes palimpsest and robert sharples suggested alexander as the most likely author original treatises there are also several extant original writings by alexander these include on the soul problems and solutions ethical problems on fate and on mixture and growth three works attributed to him are considered spurious medical questions physical problems and on fevers additional works by alexander are preserved in arabic translation these include on the principles of the universe on providence and against galen on motion on the soul de anima is treatise on the soul written along the lines suggested by aristotle in his own de anima alexander contends that the undeveloped reason in man is material nous hylikos and inseparable from the body he argued strongly against the doctrine of the soul immortality he identified the active intellect nous poietikos through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual with god second book is known as the supplement to on the soul mantissa the mantissa is series of twenty five separate pieces of which the opening five deal directly with psychology the remaining twenty pieces cover problems in physics and ethics of which the largest group deals with questions of vision and light and the final four with fate and providence the mantissa was probably not written by alexander in its current form but much of the actual material may be his problems and solutions quaestiones consists of three books which although termed problems and solutions of physical questions treat of subjects which are not all physical and are not all problems among the sixty nine items in these three books twenty four deal with physics seventeen with psychology eleven with logic and metaphysics and six with questions of fate and providence it is unlikely that alexander wrote all of the quaestiones some may be alexander own explanations while others may be exercises by his students ethical problems was traditionally counted as the fourth book of the quaestiones the work is discussion of ethical issues based on aristotle and contains responses to questions and problems deriving from alexander school it is likely that the work was not written by alexander himself but rather by his pupils on the basis of debates involving alexander on fate is treatise in which alexander argues against the stoic doctrine of necessity in on fate alexander denied three things necessity the foreknowledge of fated events that was part of the stoic identification of god and nature and determinism in the sense of sequence of causes that was laid down beforehand or predetermined by antecedents he defended view of moral responsibility we would call libertarianism today on mixture and growth discusses the topic of mixture of physical bodies it is both an extended discussion and polemic on stoic physics and an exposition of aristotelian thought on this theme on the principles of the universe is preserved in arabic translation this treatise is not mentioned in surviving greek sources but it enjoyed great popularity in the muslim world and large number of copies have survived the main purpose of this work is to give general account of aristotelian cosmology and metaphysics but it also has polemical tone and it may be directed at rival views within the peripatetic school alexander was concerned with filling the gaps of the aristotelian
