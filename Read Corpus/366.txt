apatosaurus meaning deceptive lizard is genus of herbivorous sauropod dinosaur that lived in north america during the late jurassic period othniel charles marsh described and named the first known species ajax in and second species louisae was discovered and named by william holland in apatosaurus lived about to million years ago mya during the late kimmeridgian to early tithonian age and are now known from fossils in the morrison formation of modern day colorado oklahoma new mexico wyoming and utah in the united states apatosaurus had an average length of and an average mass of few specimens indicate maximum length of greater than average and mass of the cervical vertebrae of apatosaurus are less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of diplodocus diplodocid like apatosaurus and the bones of the leg are much stockier despite being longer implying that apatosaurus was more robust animal the tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion apatosaurus had single claw on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb the apatosaurus skull long thought to be similar to camarasaurus is much more similar to that of diplodocus apatosaurus was generalized browser that likely held its head elevated to lighten its vertebrae apatosaurus had air sacs that made the bones internally full of holes like that of other diplodocids its tail may have been used as whip to create loud noises the skull of apatosaurus was confused with that of camarasaurus and brachiosaurus until when the holotype of louisae was found and complete skull just few meters away from the front of the neck henry fairfield osborn disagreed with this association and went on to mount skeleton of apatosaurus with camarasaurus skull cast apatosaurus skeletons were mounted with speculative skull casts until when mcintosh showed that more robust skulls assigned to diplodocus were more likely from apatosaurus apatosaurus is genus in the family diplodocidae it is one of the more basal genera with only amphicoelias and possibly new unnamed genus more primitive while the subfamily apatosaurinae was named in the group was not used validly until an extensive study only brontosaurus is also in the subfamily with the other genera being considered synonyms or reclassified as diplodocines brontosaurus has long been considered junior synonym of apatosaurus its type species was reclassified as excelsus in study concluded that brontosaurus is valid genus of sauropod distinct from apatosaurus but not all paleontologists agree with this division as it existed in north america during the late jurassic apatosaurus would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as allosaurus camarasaurus diplodocus and stegosaurus description comparison of ajax orange and louisae red with human blue and brontosaurus parvus green apatosaurus was large long necked quadrupedal animal with long whip like tail its forelimbs were slightly shorter than its hindlimbs most size estimates are based on specimen cm the type specimen of louisae in this was measured to be by measuring the vertebral column current estimates are similar finding that the individual was long and had mass of study that estimated the mass of volumetric models of dreadnoughtus apatosaurus and giraffatitan estimates cm at similar in mass to dreadnoughtus past estimates have put the creature mass as high as some specimens of ajax such as omnh represent individuals longer suggesting masses twice that of cm or potentially rivaling the largest titanosaurs ajax skull specimen cmc vp the skull is small in relation to the size of the animal the jaws are lined with spatulate chisel like teeth suited to an herbivorous diet the snout of apatosaurus and similar diplodocoids is squared with only nigersaurus having squarer skull the braincase of apatosaurus is well preserved in specimen byu which also preserved much of the skeleton phylogenetic analysis found that the braincase had morphology similar to those of other diplodocoids some skulls of apatosaurus have been found still in articulation with their teeth those teeth that have the enamel surface exposed do not show any scratches on the surface instead they display sugary texture and little wear ypm in side and anterior view like those of other sauropods the neck vertebrae are deeply bifurcated they carried neural spines with large trough in the middle resulting in wide deep neck the vertebral formula for the holotype of louisae is cervicals dorsals sacrals and caudals the caudal vertebra number may vary even within species the cervical vertebrae of apatosaurus and brontosaurus are stouter and more robust than those of other diplodocids and were found to be most similar to camarasaurus by charles whitney gilmore in addition they support cervical ribs that extend farther towards the ground than in diplodocines and have vertebrae and ribs that are narrower towards the top of the neck making the neck nearly triangular in cross section in apatosaurus louisae the atlas axis complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused the dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae and are instead loosely articulated apatosaurus has ten dorsal ribs on either side of the body the large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight saving air sacs apatosaurus like its close relative supersaurus has tall neural spines which make up more than half the height of the individual bones of its vertebrae the shape of the tail is unusual for diplodocid it is comparatively slender because of the rapidly decreasing height of the vertebral spines with increasing distance from the hips apatosaurus also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids giving it an unusually deep chest as in other diplodocids the tail transformed into whip like structure towards the end artistic interpretation of louisae the limb bones are also very robust within apatosaurinae the scapula of apatosaurus louisae is intermediate in morphology between those of ajax and brontosaurus excelsus the arm bones are stout so the humerus of apatosaurus resembles that of camarasaurus as well as brontosaurus however the humeri of brontosaurus and ajax are more similar to each other than they are to louisae in charles gilmore noted that previous reconstructions of
