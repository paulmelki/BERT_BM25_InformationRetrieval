algae singular alga is an informal term for large and diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms it is polyphyletic grouping that includes species from multiple distinct clades included organisms range from unicellular microalgae such as chlorella and the diatoms to multicellular forms such as the giant kelp large brown alga which may grow up to in length most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types such as stomata xylem and phloem which are found in land plants the largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds while the most complex freshwater forms are the charophyta division of green algae which includes for example spirogyra and stoneworts no definition of algae is generally accepted one definition is that algae have chlorophyll as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells although cyanobacteria are often referred to as blue green algae most authorities exclude all prokaryotes from the definition of algae algae constitute polyphyletic group since they do not include common ancestor and although their plastids seem to have single origin from cyanobacteria they were acquired in different ways green algae are examples of algae that have primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria diatoms and brown algae are examples of algae with secondary chloroplasts derived from an endosymbiotic red alga algae exhibit wide range of reproductive strategies from simple asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual reproduction algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants such as the phyllids leaf like structures of bryophytes rhizoids in nonvascular plants and the roots leaves and other organs found in tracheophytes vascular plants most are phototrophic although some are mixotrophic deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy myzotrophy or phagotrophy some unicellular species of green algae many golden algae euglenids dinoflagellates and other algae have become heterotrophs also called colorless or apochlorotic algae sometimes parasitic relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus some other heterotrophic organisms such as the apicomplexans are also derived from cells whose ancestors possessed plastids but are not traditionally considered as algae algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria that produce oxygen as by product of photosynthesis unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria fossilized filamentous algae from the vindhya basin have been dated back to to billion years ago etymology and study the singular is the latin word for seaweed and retains that meaning in english the etymology is obscure although some speculate that it is related to latin be cold no reason is known to associate seaweed with temperature more likely source is binding entwining the ancient greek word for seaweed was which could mean either the seaweed probably red algae or red dye derived from it the latinization meant primarily the cosmetic rouge the etymology is uncertain but strong candidate has long been some word related to the biblical paint if not that word itself cosmetic eye shadow used by the ancient egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern mediterranean it could be any color black red green or blue accordingly the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either phycology or algology depending on whether the greek or latin root is used the name fucus appears in number of taxa classifications the committee on the international code of botanical nomenclature has recommended certain suffixes for use in the classification of algae these are phyta for division phyceae for class phycideae for subclass ales for order inales for suborder aceae for family oidease for subfamily greek based name for genus and latin based name for species algal characteristics basic to primary classification the primary classification of algae is based on certain morphological features the chief among these are pigment constitution of the cell chemical nature of stored food materials kind number point of insertion and relative length of the flagella on the motile cell chemical composition of cell wall and presence or absence of definitely organized nucleus in the cell or any other significant details of cell structure history of classification of algae although carolus linnaeus included algae along with lichens in his th class cryptogamia he did not elaborate further on the classification of algae jean pierre Ã©tienne vaucher was perhaps the first to propose system of classification of algae and he recognized three groups conferves ulves and tremelles while johann heinrich friedrich link classified algae on the basis of the colour of the pigment and structure william henry harvey proposed system of classification on the basis of the habitat and the pigment agardh divided algae into six orders diatomaceae nostochineae confervoideae ulvaceae floriadeae and fucoideae around algae along with fungi were grouped under thallophyta division created by eichler encouraged by this adolf engler and karl prantl proposed revised scheme of classification of algae and included fungi in algae as they were of opinion that fungi have been derived from algae the scheme proposed by engler and prantl is summarised as follows schizophyta phytosarcodina flagellata dinoflagellata bacillariophyta conjugatae chlorophyceae charophyta phaeophyceae rhodophyceae eumycetes fungi false color scanning electron micrograph of the unicellular coccolithophore gephyrocapsa oceanica the algae contain chloroplasts that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria chloroplasts contain circular dna like that in cyanobacteria and are interpreted as representing reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria however the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events the table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic some retain plastids but not chloroplasts while others have lost plastids entirely phylogeny based on plastid not genealogy supergroup affiliation members endosymbiont summary primoplantae archaeplastida chlorophyta rhodophyta glaucophyta cyanobacteria these algae have primary chloroplasts the chloroplasts are surrounded by two membranes and probably developed through single endosymbiotic event the chloroplasts of red
