is the focus on analyzing material remains in archaeology origin and development of the term bernardino de sahagún is considered to be the founder of modern anthropology the abstract noun anthropology is first attested in reference to history its present use first appeared in renaissance germany in the works of magnus hundt and otto casmann their new latin derived from the combining forms of the greek words ánthrōpos human and lógos study its adjectival form appeared in the works of aristotle it began to be used in english possibly via french by the early th century through the th century in the bartholins founders of the university of copenhagen defined as follows sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently such as the use by étienne serres in to describe the natural history or paleontology of man based on comparative anatomy and the creation of chair in anthropology and ethnography in at the french national museum of natural history by jean louis armand de quatrefages de bréau various short lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed the société ethnologique de paris the first to use ethnology was formed in its members were primarily anti slavery activists when slavery was abolished in france in the société was abandoned meanwhile the ethnological society of new york currently the american ethnological society was founded on its model in as well as the ethnological society of london in break away group of the aborigines protection society these anthropologists of the times were liberal anti slavery and pro human rights activists they maintained international connections anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier th century theorists in such diverse fields as anatomy linguistics and ethnology making feature by feature comparisons of their subject matters were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals languages and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then for them the publication of charles darwin on the origin of species was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect anthropologists generally regard herodotus greek historian who lived in the bc as the first thinker to write widely on concepts that would later become central to anthropology darwin and wallace unveiled evolution in the late there was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences paul broca in paris was in the process of breaking away from the société de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies the société anthropologie de paris meeting for the first time in paris in when he read darwin he became an immediate convert to transformisme as the french called evolutionism his definition now became the study of the human group considered as whole in its details and in relation to the rest of nature broca being what today would be called neurosurgeon had taken an interest in the pathology of speech he wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals which appeared to reside in speech he discovered the speech center of the human brain today called broca area after him his interest was mainly in biological anthropology but german philosopher specializing in psychology theodor waitz took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six volume work entitled die anthropologie der naturvölker the title was soon translated as the anthropology of primitive peoples the last two volumes were published posthumously waitz defined anthropology as the science of the nature of man following broca lead waitz points out that anthropology is new field which would gather material from other fields but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy physiology and psychology to differentiate man from the animals nearest to him he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical gathered by experimentation the history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison it is to be presumed fundamentally that the species man is unity and that the same laws of thought are applicable to all men waitz was influential among the british ethnologists in the explorer richard francis burton and the speech therapist james hunt broke away from the ethnological society of london to form the anthropological society of london which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology it was the nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence representatives from the french société were present though not broca in his keynote address printed in the first volume of its new publication the anthropological review hunt stressed the work of waitz adopting his definitions as standard among the first associates were the young edward burnett tylor inventor of cultural anthropology and his brother alfred tylor geologist previously edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist subsequently an anthropologist similar organizations in other countries followed the anthropological society of madrid the american anthropological association in the anthropological society of vienna the
