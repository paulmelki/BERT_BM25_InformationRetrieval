the apple ii shown here with two disk ii floppy disk drives and era apple monitor ii the apple ii series trademarked with square brackets as apple and rendered on later models as apple is family of home computers one of the first highly successful mass produced microcomputer products designed primarily by steve wozniak manufactured by apple computer now apple inc and launched in with the original apple ii in terms of ease of use features and expandability the apple ii was major advancement over its predecessor the apple limited production bare circuit board computer for electronics hobbyists through number of models were introduced with the most popular the apple iie remaining relatively unchanged into the bit model with much more advanced graphics and sound the apple iigs was added in while compatible with earlier apple ii systems the iigs had significantly different hardware more in league with the atari st and amiga an apple ii the apple ii was first sold on june by the end of production in somewhere between five and six million apple ii series computers including about million apple iigs models had been produced the apple ii was one of the longest running mass produced home computer series with models in production for just under years the apple ii became one of several recognizable and successful computers during the and early although this was mainly limited to the us it was aggressively marketed through volume discounts and manufacturing arrangements to educational institutions which made it the first computer in widespread use in american secondary schools displacing the early leader commodore pet the effort to develop educational and business software for the apple ii including the release of the popular visicalc spreadsheet made the computer especially popular with business users and families an apple iie with disk drives and monitor despite the introduction of the motorola based macintosh in the apple ii series still reportedly accounted for of the company hardware sales in the first quarter of fiscal apple continued to sell apple ii systems alongside the macintosh until terminating the iigs in december and the iie in november the last ii series apple in production the iie card for macintoshes was discontinued on october the total apple ii sales of all of its models during its year production run were about million units with the peak occurring in when million were sold hardware all the machines in the series except the shared similar overall design elements the plastic case was designed to look more like home appliance than piece of electronic equipment and the machine could be opened without the use of tools allowing access to the computer internals an apple iic with monitor the motherboard held eight expansion slots and an array of random access memory ram sockets that could hold up to kilobytes over the course of the apple ii series life an enormous amount of first and third party hardware was made available to extend the capabilities of the machine the was designed as compact portable unit not intended to be disassembled and could not use most of the expansion hardware sold for the other machines in the series all machines in the apple ii series had built in keyboard with the exception of the iigs which had separate keyboard apple iis had color and high resolution graphics modes sound capabilities and built in basic programming language the apple ii was targeted for the masses rather than just hobbyists and engineers and influenced many of the microcomputers that followed it unlike preceding home microcomputers it was sold as finished consumer appliance rather than as kit unassembled or preassembled the apple ii series eventually supported over software programs an apple iigs apple marketed the machine as durable product including ad in which an apple ii survived fire started when cat belonging to one early user knocked over lamp software the original apple ii provided an operating system in rom along with basic variant called integer basic the only form of storage available was cassette tape when the disk ii floppy disk drive was released in new operating system apple dos was commissioned from shepardson microsystems and developed by paul laughton adding support for the disk drive the final and most popular version of this software was apple dos apple dos was superseded by prodos which supported hierarchical filesystem and larger storage devices with an optional third party based expansion card the apple ii could boot into the cp operating system and run wordstar dbase ii and other cp software with the release of mousepaint in and the apple iigs in the platform took on the look of the macintosh user interface including mouse apple eventually released applesoft basic more advanced variant of the language which users could run instead of integer basic for more capabilities some commercial apple ii software booted directly and did not use standard dos disk formats this discouraged the copying or modifying of the software on the disks and improved loading speed models apple ii an apple ii computer with an internal modem and external daa the first apple ii computers went on sale on june with mos technology later synertek microprocessor running at mhz kb of ram an audio cassette interface for loading programs and storing data and the integer basic programming language built into the roms the video controller displayed columns by lines of monochrome upper case only the original character set matches ascii characters to text on the screen with ntsc composite video output suitable for display on tv monitor or on regular tv set by way of separate rf modulator the original retail price of the computer was us with kb of ram and us with the maximum kb of ram to reflect the computer color graphics capability the apple logo on the casing was represented using rainbow stripes which remained part of apple corporate logo until early the earliest apple iis were assembled in silicon valley and later in texas printed circuit boards were
