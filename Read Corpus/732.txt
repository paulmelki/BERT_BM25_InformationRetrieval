apollo initially designated as was the first crewed mission of the united states apollo program the undertaking to land the first humans on the moon it was planned to launch on february as the first low earth orbital test of the apollo command and service module the mission never flew cabin fire during launch rehearsal test at cape kennedy air force station launch complex on january killed all three crew members command pilot virgil gus grissom senior pilot ed white and pilot roger chaffee and destroyed the command module cm the name apollo chosen by the crew was made official by nasa in their honor after the fire immediately after the fire nasa convened the apollo accident review board to determine the cause of the fire and both houses of the united states congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee nasa investigation the ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material and the high pressure pure oxygen cabin atmosphere rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch which could not be opened against the internal pressure of the cabin because the rocket was unfueled the test had not been considered hazardous and emergency preparedness for it was poor during the congressional investigation senator walter mondale publicly revealed nasa internal document citing problems with prime apollo contractor north american aviation which became known as the phillips report this disclosure embarrassed nasa administrator james webb who was unaware of the document existence and attracted controversy to the apollo program despite congressional displeasure at nasa lack of openness both congressional committees ruled that the issues raised in the report had no bearing on the accident crewed apollo flights were suspended for months while the command module hazards were addressed however the development and uncrewed testing of the lunar module lm and saturnv rocket continued the saturnib launch vehicle for apollo sa was used for the first lm test flight apollo the first successful crewed apollo mission was flown by apollo backup crew on apollo in october crew first backup crew april december second backup crew december january apollo crewed test flight plans official portrait of prime and backup crews for as as of april the backup crew standing of mcdivitt center scott left and schweickart were replaced by schirra eisele and cunningham in december as was to be the first crewed test flight of the apollo command and service module csm to earth orbit launched on saturn ib rocket as was to test launch operations ground tracking and control facilities and the performance of the apollo saturn launch assembly and would have lasted up to two weeks depending on how the spacecraft performed the csm for this flight number built by north american aviation naa was block version designed before the lunar orbit rendezvous landing strategy was chosen therefore it lacked capability of docking with the lunar module this was incorporated into the block ii csm design along with lessons learned in block block ii would be test flown with the lm when the latter was ready and would be used on the moon landing flights director of flight crew operations deke slayton selected the first apollo crew in january with grissom as command pilot white as senior pilot and rookie donn eisele as pilot but eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard the kc weightlessness training aircraft and had to undergo surgery on january slayton replaced him with chaffee and nasa announced the crew selection on march james mcdivitt david scott and russell schweickart were named as the backup crew on september walter schirra eisele and walter cunningham were named as the prime crew for second block csm flight as nasa planned to follow this with an uncrewed test flight of the lm as then the third crewed mission would be dual flight designated as or as in which as would launch the first crewed block ii csm which would then rendezvous and dock with the lm launched uncrewed on as in march nasa was studying the possibility of flying the first apollo mission as joint space rendezvous with the final project gemini mission gemini in november but by may delays in making apollo ready for flight just by itself and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the gemini made that impractical this became moot when slippage in readiness of the as spacecraft caused the last quarter target date to be missed and the mission was rescheduled for february mission background command module labeled apollo one arrives at kennedy space center august in october nasa announced the flight would carry small television camera to broadcast live from the command module the camera would also be used to allow flight controllers to monitor the spacecraft instrument panel in flight television cameras were carried aboard all crewed apollo missions insignia grissom crew received approval in june to design mission patch with the name apollo though the approval was subsequently withdrawn pending final decision on the mission designation which wasn resolved until after the fire the design center depicts command and service module flying over the southeastern united states with florida the launch point prominent the moon is seen in the distance symbolic of the eventual program goal yellow border carries the mission and astronaut names with another border set with stars and stripes trimmed in gold the insignia was designed by the crew with the artwork done by north american aviation employee allen stevens spacecraft and crew preparation the apollo crew expressed their concerns about their spacecraft problems by presenting this parody of their crew portrait to aspo manager joseph shea on august the apollo command and service module was much bigger and far more complex than any previously implemented spacecraft design in october joseph shea was named apollo spacecraft program office aspo manager responsible for managing the design and construction of both the csm and the lm in spacecraft review meeting held with shea on august week before delivery
