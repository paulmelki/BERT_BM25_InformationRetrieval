australian english aue aueng is the set of varieties of the english language native to australia although english has no official status in the constitution australian english is the country national and de facto official language as it is the first language of the majority of the population australian english began to diverge from british english after the first settlers who set up the colony of new south wales arrived in by their speech was recognised as being different from british english australian english arose from the intermingling of early settlers who were from great variety of mutually intelligible dialectal regions of great britain and ireland and quickly developed into distinct variety of english which differs considerably from most other varieties of english in vocabulary accent pronunciation register grammar and spelling history the earliest form of australian english was spoken by the children of the colonists in early new south wales this first generation of australian born children created new dialect of english that became the dialect primarily spoken in australia the australian born children in the new colony were exposed to wide range of dialects from around the british isles in particular from ireland and south east england the australian born children in the colony created the new dialect from the speech they heard around them and with it expressed peer solidarity even when new settlers arrived this new dialect was strong enough to blunt other patterns of speech quarter of the convicts were irish many had been arrested in ireland and some in great britain many of the irish spoke irish and either no english at all or spoke it poorly and rarely there were other significant populations of convicts from non english speaking parts of britain such as the scottish highlands and wales records from the early th century show this distinct dialect in the colonies after the first settlement in peter miller cunningham book two years in new south wales described the distinctive accent and vocabulary of the native born colonists that differed from that of their parents and with strong london influence linguist anthony burgess considered that australian english may be thought of as kind of fossilised cockney of the dickensian era the australian gold rushes saw many external influences on the language the first of the australian gold rushes in the began large wave of immigration during which about two percent of the population of the united kingdom emigrated to the colonies of new south wales and victoria according to linguist bruce moore the major input of the various sounds that went into constructing the australian accent was from south east england some elements of aboriginal languages have been adopted by australian english mainly as names for places flora and fauna for example dingo and local culture many such are localised and do not form part of general australian use while others such as kangaroo boomerang budgerigar wallaby and so on have become international other examples are cooee and hard yakka the former is used as high pitched call for attracting attention pronounced which travels long distances cooee is also notional distance if he within cooee we ll spot him hard yakka means hard work and is derived from yakka from the jagera yagara language once spoken in the brisbane region also of aboriginal origin is the word bung from the sydney pidgin english and ultimately from the sydney aboriginal language meaning dead with some extension to broken or useless many towns or suburbs of australia have also been influenced or named after aboriginal words the best known example is the capital canberra named after local ngunnawal language word meaning meeting place among the changes starting in the th century were the introduction of words spellings terms and usages from north american english the words imported included some later considered to be typically australian such as bushwhacker and squatter this american influence continued with the popularity of american films and the influx of american military personnel in world war ii seen in the enduring persistence of such terms as okay you guys and gee phonology and pronunciation the most obvious way in which australian english is distinctive from other varieties of english is through its unique pronunciation it shares most similarity with new zealand english like most dialects of english it is distinguished primarily by its vowel phonology vowels australian english monophthongs part of australian english diphthongs part of australian english diphthongs the vowels of australian english can be divided according to length the long vowels which include monophthongs and diphthongs mostly correspond to the tense vowels used in analyses of received pronunciation rp as well as its centring diphthongs the short vowels consisting only of monophthongs correspond to the rp lax vowels there exist pairs of long and short vowels with overlapping vowel quality giving australian english phonemic length distinction which is unusual amongst the various dialects of english though not unknown elsewhere such as in regional south eastern dialects of the uk and eastern seaboard dialects in the us as with new zealand english the weak vowel merger is complete in australian english unstressed is merged into schwa unless it is followed by velar consonant monophthongs diphthongs short vowels long vowels ipa examples ipa examples ipa examples oo oo ch oo ʉː oo se oo wh ear ear ear iː fl ee ce ea ea ou th owe ow
