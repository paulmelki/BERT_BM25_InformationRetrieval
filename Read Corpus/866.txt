ezekiel chariot vision by matthaeus merian displaying several different types of angelic creatures auf zarten saiten by ephraim moses lilien song of the angels by william adolphe bouguereau angels have appeared in works of art since early christian art and they have been popular subject for byzantine and european paintings and sculpture angels are usually intended in both christian and islamic art to be beautiful though several depictions go for more awesome or frightening attributes notably in the depiction of the living creatures which have bestial characteristics ophanim which are wheels and cherubim which have mosaic features as matter of theology they are spiritual beings who do not eat or excrete and are genderless many angels in art may appear to the modern eye to be gendered as either male or female by their dress or actions but until the th century even the most female looking will normally lack breasts and the figures should normally be considered as genderless in th century art especially funerary art this traditional convention is sometimes abandoned christian art winged angels in togas basilica di santa maria maggiore rome in the early church specific ideas regarding how to portray angels began to develop in the early church since angels are defined as pure spirits the lack of defined form has allowed artists wide latitude for creativity daniel describes gabriel as appearing in the likeness of man and in daniel he is referred to as the man gabriel such anthropomorphic descriptions of an angel are consistent with previous descriptions of angels as in genesis they were usually depicted in the form of young men the earliest known christian image of an angel in the cubicolo dell annunziazione in the catacomb of priscilla which is dated to the middle of the third century is depiction of the annunciation in which gabriel is portrayed without wings representations of angels on sarcophagi and on objects such as lamps and reliquaries of that period also show them without wings as for example the angel in the sacrifice of isaac scene in the sarcophagus of junius bassus in third century fresco of the hebrew children in the furnace in the cemetery of st priscilla dove takes the place of the angel while fourth century representation of the same subject in the coemeterium majus substitutes the hand of god for the heavenly messenger the earliest known representation of angels with wings is on what is called the prince sarcophagus discovered at sarigüzel near istanbul in the and attributed to the time of theodosius flying winged angels very often in pairs flanking central figure or subject are derivations in visual terms from pairs of winged victories in classical art in this same period saint john chrysostom explained the significance of angels wings they manifest nature sublimity that is why gabriel is represented with wings not that angels have wings but that you may know that they leave the heights and the most elevated dwelling to approach human nature accordingly the wings attributed to these powers have no other meaning than to indicate the sublimity of their nature from then on christian art generally represented angels with wings as in the cycle of mosaics in the basilica di santa maria maggiore multi winged angels often with only their face and wings showing drawn from the higher grades of angels especially cherubim and seraphim are derived from persian art and are usually shown only in heavenly contexts as opposed to performing tasks on earth they often appear in the pendentives of domes or semi domes of churches byzantine art th century icon of the archangels michael and gabriel wearing the loros of the imperial guards angels appear in byzantine art in mosaics and icons artists found some of their inspiration from winged greek figures such as victory they also drew from imperial iconography court eunuchs could rise to positions of authority in the empire they performed ceremonial functions and served as trusted messengers amelia brown points out that legislation under justinian indicates that many of them came from the caucasus having light eyes hair and skin as well as the comely features and fine bodies desired by slave traders those castrated in childhood developed distinctive skeletal structure lacked full masculine musculature body hair and beards as officials they would wear white tunic decorated with gold brown suggests that byzantine artists drew consciously or not on this iconography of the court eunuch daniel describes an angel as clothed in linen and girt with gold angels especially the archangel michael who were depicted as military style agents of god came to be shown wearing late antique military uniform this could be either the normal military dress with tunic to about the knees armour breastplate and pteruges but also often the specific dress of the bodyguard of the byzantine emperor with long tunic and the loros long gold and jewelled pallium restricted to the imperial family and their closest guards and in icons to archangels the basic military dress it is still worn in pictures into the baroque period and beyond in the west and up to the present day in eastern orthodox icons other angels came to be conventionally depicted in long robes medieval art medieval depictions of angels borrow from the byzantine in the french hours of anne of brittany gabriel wears dalmatic in the later middle ages they often wear the vestments of deacon cope over dalmatic especially gabriel in annunciation scenes for example the annunciation by jan van eyck this indicated that for all their powers they could not perform the eucharist and were in this respect outranked by every priest reinforcing the prestige of the clergy in early christian art white robes were almost invariably adopted sometimes bound with the golden girdle of revelation during the mediæval period senior angels were often clad in every brilliant colour while junior ranks wore white early renaissance painters such as jan van eyck and fra angelico painted angels with multi colored wings depictions of angels
