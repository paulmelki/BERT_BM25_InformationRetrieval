baron augustin louis cauchy august may was french mathematician engineer and physicist who made pioneering contributions to several branches of mathematics including mathematical analysis and continuum mechanics he was one of the first to state and rigorously prove theorems of calculus rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra of earlier authors he almost singlehandedly founded complex analysis and the study of permutation groups in abstract algebra profound mathematician cauchy had great influence over his contemporaries and successors hans freudenthal stated more concepts and theorems have been named for cauchy than for any other mathematician in elasticity alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for cauchy cauchy was prolific writer he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks on variety of topics in the fields of mathematics and mathematical physics biography youth and education cauchy was the son of louis françois cauchy and marie madeleine desestre cauchy had two brothers alexandre laurent cauchy who became president of division of the court of appeal in and judge of the court of cassation in and eugene françois cauchy publicist who also wrote several mathematical works cauchy married aloise de bure in she was close relative of the publisher who published most of cauchy works they had two daughters marie françoise alicia and marie mathilde cauchy father louis françois cauchy was high official in the parisian police of the ancien régime but lost this position due to the french revolution july which broke out one month before augustin louis was born the cauchy family survived the revolution and the following reign of terror by escaping to arcueil where cauchy received his first education from his father after the execution of robespierre it was safe for the family to return to paris there louis françois cauchy found himself new bureaucratic job in and quickly moved up the ranks when napoleon bonaparte came to power louis françois cauchy was further promoted and became secretary general of the senate working directly under laplace who is now better known for his work on mathematical physics the famous mathematician lagrange was also friend of the cauchy family on lagrange advice augustin louis was enrolled in the école centrale du panthéon the best secondary school of paris at that time in the fall of most of the curriculum consisted of classical languages the young and ambitious cauchy being brilliant student won many prizes in latin and the humanities in spite of these successes augustin louis chose an engineering career and prepared himself for the entrance examination to the école polytechnique in he placed second out of applicants on this exam and he was admitted one of the main purposes of this school was to give future civil and military engineers high level scientific and mathematical education the school functioned under military discipline which caused the young and pious cauchy some problems in adapting nevertheless he finished the polytechnique in at the age of and went on to the école des ponts et chaussées school for bridges and roads he graduated in civil engineering with the highest honors engineering days after finishing school in cauchy accepted job as junior engineer in cherbourg where napoleon intended to build naval base here augustin louis stayed for three years and was assigned the ourcq canal project and the saint cloud bridge project and worked at the harbor of cherbourg although he had an extremely busy managerial job he still found time to prepare three mathematical manuscripts which he submitted to the première classe first class of the institut de france cauchy first two manuscripts on polyhedra were accepted the third one on directrices of conic sections was rejected in september now years old cauchy returned to paris after becoming ill from overwork another reason for his return to the capital was that he was losing his interest in his engineering job being more and more attracted to the abstract beauty of mathematics in paris he would have much better chance to find mathematics related position therefore when his health improved in cauchy chose to not return to cherbourg although he formally kept his engineering position he was transferred from the payroll of the ministry of the marine to the ministry of the interior the next three years augustin louis was mainly on unpaid sick leave and spent his time quite fruitfully working on mathematics on the related topics of symmetric functions the symmetric group and the theory of higher order algebraic equations he attempted admission to the first class of the institut de france but failed on three different occasions between and in napoleon was defeated at waterloo and the newly installed bourbon king louis xviii took the restoration in hand the académie des sciences was re established in march lazare carnot and gaspard monge were removed from this academy for political reasons and the king appointed cauchy to take the place of one of them the reaction of cauchy peers was harsh they considered the acceptance of his membership in the academy an outrage and cauchy thereby created many enemies in scientific circles professor at école polytechnique in november louis poinsot who was an associate professor at the école polytechnique asked to be exempted from his teaching duties for health reasons cauchy was by then rising mathematical star who certainly merited professorship one of his great successes at that time was the proof of fermat polygonal number theorem however the fact that cauchy was known to be very loyal to the bourbons doubtless also helped him in becoming the successor of poinsot he finally quit his engineering job and received one year contract for teaching mathematics to second year students of the école polytechnique in this bonapartist non religious school was reorganized and several liberal professors were fired the reactionary cauchy was promoted to full professor when cauchy was years old he was still living with his parents his father found it high time for his son to marry he found him suitable bride aloïse de bure
