roman principate the first phase of the roman empire has consolidated an enduring legacy as one of the most effective and controversial leaders in human history the reign of augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the pax romana the roman world was largely free from large scale conflict for more than two centuries despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the empire frontiers and the year long civil war known as the year of the four emperors over the imperial succession augustus was born gaius octavius into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian gens octavia his maternal great uncle julius caesar was assassinated in bc and octavius was named in caesar will as his adopted son and heir afterwards octavius took the name gaius julius caesar and was called

augustus was known by many names throughout his life gaius octavius he received his birth name after his biological father in bc gaius was his praenomen while octavius was his nomen he did not yet receive cognomen at birth since his father appears to have lacked or eschewed one which would normally be inherited gaius octavius thurinus he was given the cognomen thurinus in bc when he was few years old later after he had taken the name of caesar his rival mark antony referred to him as thurinus in order to belittle him in response he merely said he was surprised that using his old name was thought to be an insult gaius julius caesar after he was adopted by julius caesar he adopted caesar name in accordance with roman naming conventions while he dropped all references to the gens octavia people colloquially added the epithet octavianus to his legal name either to differentiate him from his adoptive father or to highlight his more modest origins modern english language historians refer to him using the anglicized form octavian to the period between bc and bc rather than gaius julius caesar as he was officially called mainly to avoid possible confusion with julius caesar gaius julius caesar divi filius two years after his adoption he founded the temple of caesar additionally adding the title divi filius son of the divine to his name in attempt to strengthen his political ties to caesar former soldiers following the deification of caesar imperator caesar divi filius from bc octavian opted to use imperator the title by which troops hailed their leader after military success his
