aix advanced interactive executive pronounced is series of proprietary unix operating systems developed and sold by ibm for several of its computer platforms originally released for the ibm rt pc risc workstation aix now supports or has supported wide variety of hardware platforms including the ibm rs series and later power and powerpc based systems ibm system system mainframes ps personal computers and the apple network server aix is based on unix system with bsd compatible extensions it is one of four commercial operating systems that have versions certified to the open group unix standard the others being macos hp ux and euleros the aix family of operating systems debuted in became the standard operating system for the rs series on its launch in and is still actively developed by ibm it is currently supported on ibm power systems alongside ibm and linux aix was the first operating system to have journaling file system and ibm has continuously enhanced the software with features such as processor disk and network virtualization dynamic hardware resource allocation including fractional processor units and reliability engineering ported from its mainframe designs history ibm rs aix file servers used for ibm com in the aix version console login prompt unix started life at at bell labs research center in the early running on dec minicomputers by the operating system was in use at various academic institutions including princeton where tom lyon and others ported it to the to run as guest os under vm this port would later grow out to become uts mainframe unix offering by ibm competitor amdahl corporation ibm own involvement in unix can be dated to when it assisted bell labs in doing its own unix port to the to be used as build host for the ess switch software in the process ibm made modifications to the tss hypervisor to better support unix it took until for ibm to offer its own unix on the platform ix which was developed by interactive systems corporation and intended by ibm to compete with amdahl uts the operating system offered special facilities for interoperating with pc ix interactive ibm version of unix for ibm pc compatible hardware and was licensed at per sixteen concurrent users aix version introduced in for the ibm rt pc workstation was based on unix system releases and in developing aix ibm and interactive systems corporation whom ibm contracted also incorporated source code from and bsd unix among other variants ibm later produced aix version also known as aix based on system release for their power based rs platform since aix has served as the primary operating system for the rs series later renamed ibm eserver pseries then ibm system and now ibm power systems aix version introduced in added symmetric multiprocessing with the introduction of the first rs smp servers and continued to evolve through the culminating with aix in version in slightly modified form was also the standard operating system for the apple network server systems sold by apple computer to complement the macintosh line in the late under project monterey ibm and the santa cruz operation planned to integrate aix and unixware into single bit bit multiplatform unix with particular emphasis on running on intel ia itanium architecture cpus beta test version of aix for ia systems was released but according to documents released in the sco ibm lawsuit less than forty licenses for the finished monterey unix were ever sold before the project was terminated in in the sco group alleged that among other infractions ibm had misappropriated licensed source code from unix system release for incorporation into aix sco subsequently withdrew ibm license to develop and distribute aix ibm maintains that their license was irrevocable and continued to sell and support the product until the litigation was adjudicated aix was component of the sco ibm lawsuit in which the sco group filed lawsuit against ibm alleging ibm contributed sco intellectual property to the linux codebase the sco group who argued they were the rightful owners of the copyrights covering the unix operating system attempted to revoke ibm license to sell or distribute the aix operating system in march jury returned verdict finding that novell not the sco group owns the rights to unix aix was announced in may and it ran as an open beta from june until the general availability ga of aix on november major new features in aix included full role based access control workload partitions which enable application mobility enhanced security addition of aes encryption type for nfs and and live partition mobility on the power hardware aix was announced in april and an open beta ran until general availability of aix in september several new features including better scalability enhanced clustering and management capabilities were added aix includes new built in clustering capability called cluster aware aix aix is able to organize multiple lpars through the multipath communications channel to neighboring cpus enabling very high speed communication between processors this enables multi terabyte memory address range and page table access to support global petabyte shared memory space for aix power clusters so that software developers can program cluster as if it were single system without using message passing semaphore controlled inter process communication aix administrators can use this new capability to cluster pool of aix nodes by default aix pins kernel memory and includes support to allow applications to pin their kernel stack pinning kernel memory and the kernel stack for applications with real time requirements can provide performance improvements by ensuring that the kernel memory and kernel stack for an application is not paged out aix was announced in october and released in december aix principal feature is the live kernel update capability which allows os fixes to replace the entire aix kernel with no impact to applications by live migrating workloads to temporary surrogate aix os partition while the original os partition is patched aix was also restructured to remove obsolete components
