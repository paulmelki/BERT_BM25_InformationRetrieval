aspirin also known as acetylsalicylic acid asa is medication used to reduce pain fever or inflammation specific inflammatory conditions which aspirin is used to treat include kawasaki disease pericarditis and rheumatic fever aspirin given shortly after heart attack decreases the risk of death aspirin is also used long term to help prevent further heart attacks ischaemic strokes and blood clots in people at high risk it may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer particularly colorectal cancer for pain or fever effects typically begin within minutes aspirin is nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid and works similarly to other nsaids but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets one common adverse effect is an upset stomach more significant side effects include stomach ulcers stomach bleeding and worsening asthma bleeding risk is greater among those who are older drink alcohol take other nsaids or are on other blood thinners aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy it is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of reye syndrome high doses may result in ringing in the ears precursor to aspirin found in leaves from the willow tree has been used for its health effects for at least years in chemist charles frédéric gerhardt treated the medicine sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time for the next fifty years other chemists established the chemical structure and came up with more efficient production methods in scientists at the bayer company began studying acetylsalicylic acid as less irritating replacement medication for common salicylate medicines by bayer had named it aspirin and sold it around the world aspirin popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to competition between many brands and formulations the word aspirin was bayer brand name however their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries aspirin is one of the most widely used medications globally with an estimated to billion pills consumed each year it is on the world health organization list of essential medicines it is available as generic medication in it was the nd most commonly prescribed medication in the united states with more than million prescriptions chemical properties aspirin decomposes rapidly in solutions of ammonium acetate or the acetates carbonates citrates or hydroxides of the alkali metals it is stable in dry air but gradually hydrolyses in contact with moisture to acetic and salicylic acids in solution with alkalis the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate like flour mills factories that make aspirin tablets must pay attention to how much of the powder gets into the air inside the building because the powder air mixture can be explosive the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set recommended exposure limit in the united states of mg time weighted average in the occupational safety and health administration osha set legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of mg but this was vacated by the afl cio osha decision in synthesis the synthesis of aspirin is classified as an esterification reaction salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride an acid derivative causing chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid hydroxyl group into an ester group oh ococh this process yields aspirin and acetic acid which is considered byproduct of this reaction small amounts of sulfuric acid and occasionally phosphoric acid are almost always used as catalyst this method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs px reaction mechanism px formulations containing high concentrations of aspirin often smell like vinegar because aspirin can decompose through hydrolysis in moist conditions yielding salicylic and acetic acids physical properties aspirin an acetyl derivative of salicylic acid is white crystalline weakly acidic substance with melting point of and boiling point of its acid dissociation constant is at polymorphism polymorphism or the ability of substance to form more than one crystal structure is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients many drugs receive regulatory approval for only single crystal form or polymorph for long time only one crystal structure for aspirin was known that aspirin might have second crystalline form was suspected since the the elusive second polymorph was first discovered by vishweshwar and coworkers in and fine structural details were given by bond et al new crystal type was found after attempted of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile the form ii is only stable at and reverts to form at ambient temperature in the unambiguous form two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the acidic methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds and in the newly claimed form ii each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one with respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups both polymorphs form identical dimer structures mechanism of action discovery of the mechanism in british pharmacologist john robert vane then employed by the royal college of surgeons in london showed aspirin suppressed the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes for this discovery he was awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine jointly with sune bergström and bengt ingemar samuelsson prostaglandins and thromboxanes aspirin ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase cox officially known as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase ptgs enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to serine residue in the active site of the ptgs enzyme suicide inhibition this makes aspirin different from other nsaids such as diclofenac and ibuprofen which are reversible inhibitors low dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane in platelets producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet days this antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in people who have had heart attack unstable angina ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack mg of
