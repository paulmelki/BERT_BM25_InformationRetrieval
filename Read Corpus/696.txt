annealing may refer to annealing metallurgy heat treatment that alters the microstructure of material causing changes in properties such as strength hardness and ductility annealing glass heating piece of glass to remove stress annealing biology in genetics means for complementary sequences of single stranded dna or rna to pair by hydrogen bonds to form double stranded polynucleotide simulated annealing numerical optimization technique for searching for solution in space otherwise too large for ordinary search methods to yield results quantum annealing method for finding solutions to combinatorial optimisation problems and ground states of glassy systems using quantum fluctuations
