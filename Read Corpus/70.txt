skeleton of an aardvark the aardvark orycteropus afer is medium sized burrowing nocturnal mammal native to africa it is the only living species of the order tubulidentata although other prehistoric species and genera of tubulidentata are known unlike most other insectivores it has long pig like snout which is used to sniff out food it roams over most of the southern two thirds of the african continent avoiding areas that are mainly rocky nocturnal feeder it subsists on ants and termites which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs it also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young it receives least concern rating from the iucn although its numbers seem to be decreasing aardvarks are afrotheres clade which also includes elephants manatees and hyraxes name and taxonomy name the aardvark is sometimes colloquially called the african ant bear anteater not to be confused with the south american anteater or the cape anteater after the cape of good hope the name aardvark is afrikaans comes from earlier afrikaans erdvark and means earth pig or ground pig aarde earth ground vark pig because of its burrowing habits the name orycteropus means burrowing foot and the name afer refers to africa the name of the aardvarks order tubulidentata comes from the tubule style teeth taxonomy the skull of an aardvark the aardvark is not closely related to the pig rather it is the sole extant representative of the obscure mammalian order tubulidentata in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus orycteropus the sole surviving genus in the family orycteropodidae the aardvark is not closely related to the south american anteater despite sharing some characteristics and superficial resemblance the similarities are based on convergent evolution the closest living relatives of the aardvark are the elephant shrews tenrecs and golden moles along with the sirenians hyraxes elephants and their extinct relatives these animals form the superorder afrotheria studies of the brain have shown the similarities with condylarthra and given the clade status as wastebasket taxon it may mean some species traditionally classified as condylarths are actually stem aardvarks evolutionary history based on fossils bryan patterson has concluded that early relatives of the aardvark appeared in africa around the end of the paleocene the ptolemaiidans mysterious clade of mammals with uncertain affinities may actually be stem aardvarks either as sister clade to tubulidentata or as grade leading to true tubulidentates the first unambiguous tubulidentate was probably myorycteropus africanus from kenyan miocene deposits the earliest example from the genus orycteropus was orycteropus mauritanicus found in algeria in deposits from the middle miocene with an equally old version found in kenya fossils from the aardvark have been dated to million years and have been located throughout europe and the near east the mysterious pleistocene from madagascar was originally thought to be tubulidentate that was descended from ancestors that entered the island during the eocene however number of subtle anatomical differences coupled with recent molecular evidence now lead researchers to believe that is relative of golden moles and tenrecs that achieved an aardvark like appearance and ecological niche through convergent evolution subspecies the aardvark has seventeen poorly defined subspecies listed orycteropus afer afer adametzi grote aethiopicus sundevall angolensis zukowsky haltenorth

wardi lydekker wertheri matschie the encyclopædia britannica also mentions capensis or cape ant bear from south africa description an aardvark skeleton and mounted individual the aardvark is vaguely pig like in appearance its body is stout with prominently arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs the limbs are of moderate length with the rear legs being longer than the forelegs the front feet have lost the pollex or thumb resulting in four toes while the rear feet have all five toes each toe bears large robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovel like and appears to be intermediate between claw and hoof whereas the aardvark is considered digitigrade it appears at time to be plantigrade this confusion happens because when it squats it stands on its soles contributing characteristic to the burrow digging capabilities of aardvarks is an endosteal tissue called compacted coarse cancellous bone cccb the stress and strain resistance provided by cccb allows aardvarks to create their burrows ultimately leading to favorable environment for plants and variety of animals an aardvark weight is typically between an aardvark length is usually between and can reach lengths of when its tail which can be up to is taken into account it is tall at the shoulder and has girth of about it is the largest member of the proposed clade the aardvark is pale yellowish gray in color and often stained reddish brown by soil the aardvark coat is thin and the animal primary protection is its tough skin its hair is short on its head and tail however its legs tend to have longer hair the hair on the majority of its body is grouped in clusters of hairs the hair surrounding its nostrils is dense to help filter particulate matter out as it digs its tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers head the greatly elongated head is set on short thick neck and the end of the snout bears disc which houses the nostrils it contains thin but complete zygomatic arch the head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features one of the most distinctive characteristics of the tubulidentata is their teeth instead of having pulp cavity each tooth has cluster of thin hexagonal upright parallel tubes of vasodentin modified form of dentine with individual pulp canals held together by cementum the number of columns is dependent on the size of the tooth with the largest having about the teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously the aardvark is born with conventional incisors
