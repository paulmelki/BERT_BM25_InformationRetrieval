philosophy is the dominant philosophical thought in china and other countries within the east asian cultural sphere that share common language including japan korea and vietnam schools of thought hundred schools of thought the hundred schools of thought were philosophers and schools that flourished from the th century to bce an era of great cultural and intellectual expansion in china even though this period known in its earlier part as the spring and autumn period and the warring states period in its latter part was fraught with chaos and bloody battles it is also known as the golden age of chinese philosophy because broad range of thoughts and ideas were developed and discussed freely the thoughts and ideas discussed and refined during this period have profoundly influenced lifestyles and social consciousness up to the present day in east asian countries the intellectual society of this era was characterized by itinerant scholars who were often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the methods of government war and diplomacy this period ended with the rise of the qin dynasty and the subsequent purge of dissent the book of han lists ten major schools they are confucianism which teaches that human beings are teachable improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self cultivation and self creation main idea of confucianism is the cultivation of virtue and the development of moral perfection confucianism holds that one should give up one life if necessary either passively or actively for the sake of upholding the cardinal moral values of ren and yi legalism often compared with machiavelli and foundational for the traditional chinese bureaucratic empire the legalists examined administrative methods emphasizing realistic consolidation of the wealth and power of autocrat and state taoism also called daoism philosophy which emphasizes the three jewels of the tao compassion moderation and humility while taoist thought generally focuses on nature the relationship between humanity and the cosmos health and longevity and wu wei action through inaction harmony with the universe or the

seek to imitate heaven by engaging in the practice of collective love his epistemology can be regarded as primitive materialist empiricism he believed that human cognition ought to be based on one perceptions one sensory experiences such as sight and hearing instead of imagination or internal logic elements founded on the human capacity for abstraction mozi advocated frugality condemning the confucian emphasis on ritual and music which he denounced as extravagant naturalism the school of naturalists or the yin yang school which synthesized the concepts of yin and yang and the five
