band of men on horseback there was huge outcry in constance when it was discovered that john had fled and sigismund was furious about this setback to his plans for ending the schism the king of the romans issued orders to all the powers on the upper rhine and in swabia stating that he had declared frederick to be an outlaw and that his lands and possessions were forfeit in due course this led to

rhine to the town of freiburg im breisgau which recognised the duke of austria as its lord there sigismund lieutenant ludwig iii elector palatine caught up with them he convinced frederick that he
