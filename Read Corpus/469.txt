amaranthus is cosmopolitan genus of annual or short lived perennial plants collectively known as amaranths some amaranth species are cultivated as leaf vegetables pseudocereals and ornamental plants most of the amaranthus species are summer annual weeds and are commonly referred to as pigweeds catkin like cymes of densely packed flowers grow in summer or autumn amaranth varies in flower leaf and stem color with range of striking pigments from the spectrum of maroon to crimson and can grow longitudinally from tall with cylindrical succulent fibrous stem that is hollow with grooves and bracteoles when mature there are approximately species in the genus of which are dioecious and native to north america with the remaining monoecious species endemic to every continent from tropical lowlands to the himalayas members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus celosia amaranth grain is collected from the genus the leaves of some species are also eaten etymology and culture amaranth derives from greek unfading with the greek word for flower factoring into the word development as amaranth the unfading flower amarant is an archaic variant the name was first applied to the related celosia amaranthus and celosia share long lasting dried flowers as amaranthus plants were not yet known in europe the showy amaranth present in john milton garden of eden is remov from heav when it blossoms because the flowers shade the fountain of life he describes amaranth as immortal in reference to the flowers that generally do not wither and retain bright reddish tones of color even when deceased sometimes referred to as love lies bleeding description amaranth grain left and wheat right amaranth is herbaceous plant or shrub that is either annual or perennial across the genus flowers vary from the presence of or tepals and stamens whereas porate pollen grain structure remains consistent across the family species across the genus contain concentric rings of vascular bundles and fix carbon efficiently with photosynthetic pathway leaves are approximately and of oval or elliptical shape that are either opposite or alternate across species although most leaves are whole and simple with entire margins amaranth has primary root with deeper spreading secondary fibrous root structures inflorescences are in the form large panicle that varies from terminal to axial color and sex the tassel of fluorescence is either erect or bent and varies in width and length between species flowers are radially symmetric and either bisexual or unisexual with very small bristly perianth and pointy bracts species in this genus are either monecious hybridus or dioecious arenicola fruits are in the form of capsules referred to as unilocular pixdio that opens at maturity the top operculum of the unilocular pixdio releases the urn that contains the seed seeds are circular form from to millimeters in diameter and range in color with shiny smooth seed coat the panicle is harvested days after cultivation with approximately to seeds harvested per gram taxonomy amaranthus shows wide variety of morphological diversity among and even within certain species amaranthus is part of the amaranthaceae that is part of the larger grouping of the carophyllales although the family amaranthaceae is distinctive the genus has few distinguishing characters among the species present across six continents this complicates taxonomy and amaranthus has generally been considered among systematists as difficult genus and hybridize often in sauer classified the genus into two subgenera differentiating only between monoecious and dioecious species acnida aellen ex robertson and amaranthus although this classification was widely accepted further infrageneric classification was and still is needed to differentiate this widely diverse group mosyakin and robertson later divided into three subgenera acnida amaranthus and albersia the support for the addition of the subdivision albersia because of its circumcise indehiscent fruits coupled with three elliptic to linear tepals to be exclusive characters to members of this subgenus the classification of these groups are further supported with combination of floral characters reproductive strategies geographic distribution and molecular evidence the phylogenies of amaranthus of maximum parsimony and bayesian analysis of nuclear and chloroplast genes suggest five clades within the genus diecious pumilus hybris galapagos eurasian south african australian esa esa south american amaranthus includes three recognised subgenera and species although species numbers are questionable due to hybridisation and species concepts infrageneric classification focuses on inflorescence flower characters and whether species is monoecious dioecious as in the sauer suggested classification bracteole morphology present on the stem is used for taxonomic classification of amaranth wild species have longer bracteole compared to cultivated species modified infrageneric classification of amaranthus includes three subgenera acnida amaranthus and albersia with the taxonomy further differentiated by sections within each of the subgenera there is near certainty that hypochondriacus is the common ancestor to the cultivated grain species however the later series of domestication to follow remains unclear there has been opposing hypotheses of single as opposed to multiple domestication events of the three grain species there is evidence of phylogenetic and geographical support for clear groupings that indicate separate domestication events in south america and central america hybridus may derive from south america whereas quentiensis caudatus and hypochondriacus are native to central and north america species species include amaranthus acanthochiton greenstripe amaranthus acutilobus synonym of amaranthus viridis amaranthus albus white pigweed
