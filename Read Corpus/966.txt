john philip sousa manuscript arrangement of richard wagner the flying dutchman overture page of in music an arrangement is musical of previously composed work it may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization melodic paraphrasing orchestration or development of the formal structure arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra concert band or other musical ensemble arranging involves adding compositional techniques such as new thematic material for introductions transitions or modulations and endings arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety classical music arrangement and transcriptions of classical and serious music go back to the early history of this genre eighteenth century bach frequently made arrangements of his own and other composers pieces one striking example is the arrangement that he made of the prelude from his partita no for solo violin bwv bach partita for violin preludebach partita for violin prelude bach transformed this solo piece into an orchestral sinfonia that introduces his cantata bwv the initial violin composition was in major but both arranged versions are transposed down to the better to accommodate the wind instruments bach cantata sinfoniabach cantata sinfonia the transformation of material conceived for single string instrument into fully orchestrated concerto type movement is so successful that it is unlikely that anyone hearing the latter for the first time would suspect the existence of the former nineteenth and twentieth centuries in particular music written for the piano has frequently undergone this treatment as it has been arranged for orchestra chamber ensemble or concert band beethoven made an arrangement of his piano sonata no for string quartet conversely beethoven also arranged his grosse fuge movement from one of his late string quartets for piano duet pictures at an exhibition suite of ten piano pieces by modest mussorgsky has been arranged over twenty times notably by maurice ravel due to his lack of expertise in orchestration the american composer george gershwin had his rhapsody in blue arranged and orchestrated by ferde grofé erik satie wrote his three gymnopédies for solo piano in satie gymnopedie no for piano solosatie gymnopedie no for piano solo eight years later debussy arranged two of them exploiting the range of instrumental timbres available in late th century orchestra it was debussy whose orchestrations of the gymnopédies put their composer on the map debussy gymnopedie arrangement of satie gymnopedie debussy gymnopedie arrangement of satie gymnopedie number of franz schubert songs originally for voice with piano accompaniment were arranged by other composers for example schubert highly charged graphic song erlkönig the erl king has piano introduction that conveys unflagging energy from the start schubert erlkönig piano erlkönig piano introductionthe arrangement of this song by hector berlioz uses strings to convey faithfully the driving urgency and threatening atmosphere of the original erlkönig arrangement by berlioz px berlioz adds colour in bars through the addition of woodwind horns and ominously rumbling timpani with typical flamboyance berlioz adds spice to the harmony in bar with an flat in the horn part creating half diminished seventh chord which is not in schubert original piano part erlkönig arrangement by berlioz there are subtle differences between this and the arrangement of the song by franz liszt the upper string sound is thicker with violins and violas playing the fierce repeated octaves in unison and bassoons compensating for this by doubling the cellos and basses there are no timpani but trumpets and horns add small jolt to the rhythm of the opening bar reinforcing the bare octaves of the strings by playing on the second main beat erl king arrangement by liszt opening barserl king arrangement by liszt bars unlike berlioz liszt does not alter the harmony but changes the emphasis somewhat in bar with the note in the oboes and clarinets grating against rather than blending with the in the strings erl king arrangement by liszt bars schubert has come in for his fair share of transcriptions and arrangements most like liszt transcriptions of the lieder or berlioz orchestration for erlkönig tell us more about the arranger that about the original composer but they can be diverting so long as they are in no way replacement for the original popular music popular music recordings often include parts for brass horn sections bowed strings and other instruments that were added by arrangers and not composed by the original songwriters some pop arrangers even add sections using full orchestra though this is less common due to the expense popular music arrangements may also be considered to include new releases of existing songs with new musical treatment these changes can include alterations to tempo meter key instrumentation and other musical elements well known examples include joe cocker version of the beatles with little help from my friends cream crossroads and ike and tina turner version of creedence clearwater revival proud mary the american group vanilla fudge and british group yes based their early careers on radical re arrangements of contemporary hits bonnie pointer performed disco and motown themed versions of heaven must have sent you remixes such as in dance music can also be considered arrangements though arrangers may contribute substantially to finished musical products they usually hold no legal claim to their work for the purpose of copyright and royalty payments jazz arrangements for small jazz combos are usually informal minimal and uncredited larger ensembles have generally had greater requirements for notated arrangements though the early count basie big band is known for its many head arrangements so called because they were worked out by the players themselves memorized in the player head and never written down most arrangements for big bands however were written down and credited to specific arranger as with arrangements by sammy nestico and neal hefti for count basie later big bands don redman made innovations in jazz arranging as part of fletcher henderson orchestra in the redman arrangements introduced more intricate melodic presentation and soli performances for
