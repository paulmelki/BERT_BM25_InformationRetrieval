the very first kit version of the aster ct running newdos the trs mode screen uses only small part of the monitor screen because the letters are the same size as the cp screen this was one of the things that was fixed soon after with the redesign to commercial product the aster ct an early home personal computer developed by the small dutch company mcp later renamed to aster computers was sold in its first incarnation as kit for hobbyists later it was sold ready to use it consisted of several eurocard pcb with din connectors and backplane all based on inch rack configuration it was the first commercially available dutch personal home computer the aster computer could use the software written for the popular tandy trs computer while fixing many of the problems of that computer but it could also run cp software with big amount of free memory transient program area tpa and full display and it could be used as videotext terminal although the aster was clone of the trs model it was in fact more compatible with the trs model iii and ran all the software of these systems including games it also had built in speaker which was compatible with such games software models three models were sold the first model launched june looked like the later ibm pc which came on the market years later rectangular base unit with two floppy drives on the front and monitor on top with separate detachable keyboard the second incarnation was much smaller unit the width of two floppy drives stacked on top of each other and the third incarnation looked like flattened apple with built in keyboard all units ran much faster than the original trs at mhz with software selectable throttle to the original speed for compatibility purposes and the display supported upper and lower case hardware snow suppression video ram bus arbitration logic and an improved character font set the floppy disk interface supported dual density and disk capacities up to kb more than four times the capacity of the original trs special version of newdos an improved trs dos compatible disk operating system was used to support these disk capacities when using the trs compatibility mode for the educational market version of the first model was produced with new plastic enclosure the first asters had an all metal enclosure that also had an opening on the top in which cassette recorder could be placed this model was used in cluster with one aster with disk drives for the teacher and eight disk less versions for the pupils the pupils could download software from the teachers computer through network based on fast serial connection as well as sending back their work to the teachers computer there was also hardware in place through which the teacher could see the display of each pupils screen on his own monitor working modes the aster used kb of ram memory and had the unique feature of supporting two fundamentally different internal architectures when turned on without boot floppy or with trs dos floppy the aster would be fully trs compatible with kb or ram when the boot loader detected cp floppy the aster would reconfigure its internal memory architecture on the fly to optimally support cp with kb free ram for programs tpa and an display this dual architecture capability only existed on one other trs clone the lobo max with special configuration tool the ct could reconfigure its floppy drivers to read and write the floppies of about other cp systems third mode was entered with special boot floppy which turned the aster into videotex terminal with display and videotex character set the software used the built in rs interface of the aster to control modem through which it could contact prestel service provider sales most aster ct about thousand of them were sold to schools for computer education in project first known as the honderd scholen project one hundred schools project but which later involved many more than just one hundred schools mcp received this order from the dutch government because their computer met all the technical and other demands including the demand that the computers should be of dutch origin and should be built in the netherlands another important demand was that the computers could be used in network aster developed special software and hardware for that later however the government turned around and gave of the order to philips and their homecomputer even though the did not meet all the technical demands was made in austria and did not have network hardware nor software company aster computers was based in the small town of arkel near the town of gorinchem initially aster computer was called mcp music print computer product because it was specialized in producing computer assisted printing of sheet music the director of the company was interested in microprocessor technology and noticed there was market for selling kits to computer building amateurs so they started selling electronic kits to hobbyists and employed four persons at that time they also assembled kits for people without soldering skills especially the junior computer from elektor copy of the kim and the zx from sinclair among the kits sold there were also alternative floppy disk drives for trs computers but these needed the infamous trs expansion interface which was very expensive and had very unreliable floppy disk controller because it used the wd floppy disc controller chip without an external data separator to fix this problem mcp developed small plugin board which could be plugged into the socket for the wd and which contained data separator and socket for the wd to support dual density operation still the expansion interface was expensive and due to its design it was also unreliable so they decided to also develop their own alternative in the form of an improved floppy disk controller and printer interface that could be built right into floppy disk enclosure the lack of ram expansion
