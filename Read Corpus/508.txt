alexander iii march november was emperor of russia king of poland and grand duke of finland from march until his death on november he was highly reactionary and reversed some of the liberal reforms of his father alexander ii under the influence of konstantin pobedonostsev he opposed any reform that limited his autocratic rule during his reign russia fought no major wars he was therefore styled the peacemaker early life disposition alexander iii as tsesarevich by sergei lvovich levitsky grand duke alexander alexandrovich was born on march at the winter palace in saint petersburg russian empire the second son and third child of emperor alexander ii and his first wife maria alexandrovna née princess marie of hesse in disposition alexander bore little resemblance to his soft hearted liberal father and still less to his refined philosophic sentimental chivalrous yet cunning great uncle emperor alexander who could have been given the title of the first gentleman of europe although an enthusiastic amateur musician and patron of the ballet alexander was seen as lacking refinement and elegance indeed he rather relished the idea of being of the same rough texture as some of his subjects his straightforward abrupt manner savoured sometimes of gruffness while his direct unadorned method of expressing himself harmonized well with his rough hewn immobile features and somewhat sluggish movements his education was not such as to soften these peculiarities more than six feet tall about he was also noted for his immense physical strength sebaceous cyst on the left side of his nose caused him to be mocked by some of his contemporaries and he sat for photographs and portraits with the right side of his face most prominent an account from the memoirs of the artist alexander benois gives one impression of alexander iii after performance of the ballet tsar kandavl at the mariinsky theatre first caught sight of the emperor was struck by the size of the man and although cumbersome and heavy he was still mighty figure there was indeed something of the muzhik russian peasant about him the look of his bright eyes made quite an impression on me as he passed where was standing he raised his head for second and to this day can remember what felt as our eyes met it was look as cold as steel in which there was something threatening even frightening and it struck me like blow the tsar gaze the look of man who stood above all others but who carried monstrous burden and who every minute had to fear for his life and the lives of those closest to him in later years came into contact with the emperor on several occasions and felt not the slightest bit timid in more ordinary cases tsar alexander iii could be at once kind simple and even almost homely education though he was destined to be strongly counter reforming emperor alexander had little prospect of succeeding to the throne during the first two decades of his life as he had an elder brother nicholas who seemed of robust constitution even when nicholas first displayed symptoms of delicate health the notion that he might die young was never taken seriously and he was betrothed to princess dagmar of denmark daughter of king christian ix of denmark and queen louise of denmark and whose siblings included king frederick viii of denmark queen alexandra of the united kingdom and king george of greece great solicitude was devoted to the education of nicholas as tsesarevich whereas alexander received only the training of an ordinary grand duke of that period this included acquaintance with french english and german and military drill as tsesarevich empress maria fyodorovna which took place on at the uspensky sobor of the moscow kremlin on the left of the dais can be seen his young son and heir the tsarevich nicholas and behind nicholas can be seen young grand duke george alexander became tsesarevich upon nicholas sudden death in it was then that he began to study the principles of law and administration under konstantin pobedonostsev then professor of civil law at moscow state university and later from chief procurator of the holy synod of the orthodox church in russia pobedonostsev instilled into the young man mind the belief that zeal for russian orthodox thought was an essential factor of russian patriotism to be cultivated by every right minded emperor while he was heir apparent from to alexander did not play prominent part in public affairs but allowed it to become known that he had ideas which did not coincide with the principles of the existing government on his deathbed the previous tsesarevich was said to have expressed the wish that his fiancée princess dagmar of denmark should marry his successor this wish was swiftly realized when on in the grand church of the winter palace in st petersburg alexander wed dagmar who converted to orthodox christianity and took the name maria feodorovna the union proved happy one to the end unlike nearly all of his predecessors since peter there was no adultery in his marriage the couple spent their wedding night at the tsarevich private dacha known as my property later on the tsarevich became estranged from his father this was due to their vastly differing political views as well as his resentment towards alexander ii long standing relationship with catherine dolgorukov with whom he had several illegitimate children while his mother the empress was suffering from chronic ill health to the scandal of many at court including the tsarevich himself alexander ii married catherine mere month after marie alexandrovna death in reign on march alexander father alexander ii was assassinated by members of the extremist organization narodnaya volya as result he ascended to the russian imperial throne in nennal he and maria feodorovna were officially crowned and anointed at the assumption cathedral in moscow on may alexander ascension to the throne was followed by an outbreak of anti jewish riots
