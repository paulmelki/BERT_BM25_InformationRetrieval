del carmel is located on the northern face park güell is located in la salut neighborhood in the gràcia district of barcelona with urbanization in mind eusebi güell assigned the design of the park to antoni gaudí renowned architect and the face of catalan modernism the park was built from to and was officially opened as public park in in unesco declared the park world heritage site under works of antoni gaudí description park güell is the reflection of gaudí artistic plenitude which belongs to his naturalist phase first decade of the th century during this period the architect perfected his personal style through inspiration from organic shapes he put into practice series of new structural solutions rooted in the analysis of geometry to that the catalan artist adds creative liberty and an imaginative ornamental creation starting from sort of baroquism his works acquire structural richness of forms and volumes free of the rational rigidity or any sort of classic premises in the design of park güell gaudí unleashed all his architectonic genius and put to practice much of his innovative structural solutions that would become the symbol of his organic style and that would culminate in the creation of the basilica and expiatory church of the holy family catalan sagrada familia güell and gaudí conceived this park situated within natural park they imagined an organized grouping of high quality homes decked out with all the latest technological advancements to ensure maximum comfort finished off with an artistic touch they also envisioned community strongly influenced by symbolism since in the common elements of the park they were trying to synthesize many of the political and religious ideals shared by patron and architect therefore there are noticeable concepts originating from political catalanism especially in the entrance stairway where the catalan countries are represented and from catholicism the monumento al calvario originally designed to be chapel the mythological elements are so important apparently güell and gaudí conception of the park was also inspired by the temple of apollo of delphi on the other hand many experts have tried to link the park to various symbols because of the complex iconography that gaudí applied to the urban project such references go from political vindication to religious exaltation passing through mythology history and philosophy specifically many studies claim to see references to freemasonry despite the deep religious beliefs of both gaudí and count güell these references have not been proven in the historiography of the modern architect the multiplicity of symbols found in the park güell is as previously mentioned associated to political and religious signs with touch of mystery according to the preferences of that time for enigmas and puzzles origins as housing development the gaudi house museum the park was originally part of commercially unsuccessful housing site the idea of count eusebi güell after whom the park was named it was inspired by the english garden city movement hence the original english name park in catalan the name is parc güell the site was rocky hill with little vegetation and few trees called muntanya pelada bare mountain it already included large country house called larrard house or muntaner de dalt house and was next to neighbourhood of upper class houses called la salut the health the intention was to exploit the fresh air well away from smoky factories and beautiful views from the site with sixty triangular lots being provided for luxury houses count eusebi güell added to the prestige of the development by moving in to live in larrard house ultimately only two houses were built neither designed by gaudí one was intended to be show house but on being completed in was put up for sale and as no buyers came forward gaudí at güell suggestion bought it with his savings and moved in with his family and his father in this house where gaudí lived from to was built by francesc berenguer in it contains original works by gaudí and several of his collaborators it is now the gaudi house museum casa museu gaudí since in it was declared

and remarkable with fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles fit in well with the use of the park as pleasure gardens and seem relatively inconspicuous in the landscape when one considers the flamboyance of other buildings designed by gaudí these two buildings make up the porter lodge pavilion one of these buildings contains small room with telephone booth the other while once being the porter house is now permanent exhibition of the barcelona city history museum muhba focused on the building itself the park and the city the focal point of the park is the main terrace surrounded by
