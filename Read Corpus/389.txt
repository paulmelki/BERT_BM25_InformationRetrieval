the family alligatoridae of crocodylians includes alligators and caimans phylogeny olseni fore limb alligator prenasalis fossil the superfamily alligatoroidea includes all crocodilians fossil and extant that are more closely related to the american alligator than to either the nile crocodile or the gharial this superfamily is thought to have split from the crocodile gharial lineage in the late cretaceous about million years ago leidyosuchus of alberta is the earliest known genus fossil alligatoroids have been found throughout eurasia as land bridges across both the north atlantic and the bering strait have connected north america to eurasia during the cretaceous paleogene and neogene periods alligators and caimans split in north america during the early tertiary or late cretaceous about million to about million years ago and the latter reached south america by the paleogene before the closure of the isthmus of panama during the neogene period the chinese alligator split from the american alligator about million years ago and likely descended from lineage that crossed the bering land bridge during the neogene the modern american alligator is well represented in the fossil record of the pleistocene the alligator full mitochondrial genome was sequenced in the and it suggests the animal evolved at rate similar to mammals and greater than birds and most cold blooded vertebrates the full genome published in suggests that the alligator evolved much more slowly than mammals and birds true alligators the lineage including alligators proper alligatorinae occurs in the fluvial deposits of the age of the upper chalk in europe where they did not die out until the pliocene age the true alligators are today represented by two species in the southeastern united states which can grow to ft and weigh lbs kg and the small sinensis in the yangtze river china which grows to an average of ft their name derives from the spanish el lagarto which means the lizard caimans in central and south america the alligator family is represented by six species of the subfamily caimaninae which differ from the alligator by the absence of bony septum between the nostrils and having ventral armour composed of overlapping bony scutes each of which is formed of two parts united by suture besides the three species in caiman the smooth fronted caimans in genus paleosuchus and the black caiman in melanosuchus are described caimans tend to be more agile and crocodile like in their movements and have longer sharper teeth than alligators crocodilus the spectacled caiman has the widest distribution from southern mexico to the northern half of argentina and grows to modest size of about the largest is the near threatened melanosuchus niger the jacaré açu or large or black caiman of the amazon river basin black caimans grow to with the largest recorded size the black caiman and american alligator are the only members of the alligator family that pose the same danger to humans as the larger species of the crocodile family although caimans have not been studied in depth scientists have learned their mating cycles previously thought to be spontaneous or year round are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels which increases chances of survival for their offspring taxonomy an alligator nest at everglades national park florida united states spectacled caiman head black caiman jauaperi river amazonia head of smooth fronted caiman superfamily alligatoroidea family alligatoridae subfamily alligatorinae genus albertochampsa genus alligator alligator mcgrewi alligator mefferdi american alligator alligator alligator olseni alligator prenasalis chinese alligator alligator sinensis genus genus arambourgia genus ceratosuchus genus chrysochampsa genus eoalligator genus hassiacosuchus genus hispanochampsa genus krabisuchus genus navajosuchus genus procaimanoidea genus wannaganosuchus subfamily caimaninae genus caiman yacare caiman caiman yacare spectacled caiman caiman crocodilus rio apaporis caiman apaporiensis brown caiman fuscus broad snouted caiman caiman latirostris caiman lutescans genus melanosuchus melanosuchus fisheri black caiman melanosuchus niger genus eocaiman genus mourasuchus genus necrosuchus genus orthogenysuchus genus paleosuchus cuvier dwarf caiman paleosuchus palpebrosus smooth fronted caiman paleosuchus trigonatus genus purussaurus references external links crocodilians natural history conservation crocodilian com family alligatoridae gray alligator fossilworks org
