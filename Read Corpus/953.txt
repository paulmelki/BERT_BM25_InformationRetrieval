diagram of zinc anode in galvanic cell note how electrons move out of the cell and the conventional current moves into it in the opposite direction an anode is an electrode through which the conventional current enters into polarized electrical device this contrasts with cathode an electrode through which conventional current leaves an electrical device common mnemonic is acid for anode current into device the direction of conventional current the flow of positive charges in circuit is opposite to the direction of electron flow so negatively charged electrons flow out the anode of galvanic cell into an outside or external circuit connected to the cell in both galvanic cell and an electrolytic cell the anode is the electrode at which the oxidation reaction occurs in an electrolytic cell the anode is the wire or plate having excess positive charge consequently anions will tend to move towards the anode where they can undergo oxidation historically the anode has also been known as the zincode charge flow the terms anode and cathode are not defined by the voltage polarity of electrodes but the direction of current through the electrode an anode is an electrode through which conventional current positive charge flows into the device from an external circuit while cathode is an electrode through which conventional current flows out of the device if the current through the electrodes reverses direction as occurs for example in rechargeable battery when it is being charged the naming of the electrodes as anode and cathode is reversed conventional current depends not only on the direction the charge carriers move but also the carriers electric charge the currents outside the device are usually carried by electrons in metal conductor since electrons have negative charge the direction of electron flow is opposite to the direction of conventional current consequently electrons leave the device through the anode and enter the device through the cathode the definition of anode and cathode is different for electrical devices such as diodes and vacuum tubes where the electrode naming is fixed and does not depend on the actual charge flow current these devices usually allow substantial current flow in one direction but negligible current in the other direction therefore the electrodes are named based on the direction of this forward current in diode the anode is the terminal through which current enters and the cathode is the terminal through which current leaves when the diode is forward biased the names of the electrodes do not change in cases where reverse current flows through the device similarly in vacuum tube only one electrode can emit electrons into the evacuated tube due to being heated by filament so electrons can only enter the device from the external circuit through the heated electrode therefore this electrode is permanently named the cathode and the electrode through which the electrons exit the tube is named the anode examples electric current and electrons directions for secondary battery during discharge and charge the polarity of voltage on an anode with respect to an associated cathode varies depending on the device type and on its operating mode in the following examples the anode is negative in device that provides power and positive in device that consumes power in discharging battery or galvanic cell diagram at right the anode is the negative terminal because it is where conventional current flows into the cell this inward current is carried externally by electrons moving outwards negative charge flowing in one direction being electrically equivalent to positive charge flowing in the opposite direction in recharging battery or an electrolytic cell the anode is the positive terminal which receives current from an external generator the current through recharging battery is opposite to the direction of current during discharge in other words the electrode which was the cathode during battery discharge becomes the anode while the battery is recharging this ambiguity in the anode and cathode designation causes confusion in battery engineering as is necessary to have the anode and cathode associated with unique physical components the common convention is to name the electrode of battery that releases electrons during discharge as the anode or the negative electrode and the electrode that absorbs the electrons as the cathode or the positive electrode naming the physical electrodes as positive or negative has the additional advantage as these labels apply equally well in both charge discharge conditions for rechargeable batteries as well as for the and electronic devices in diode the anode is the positive terminal at the tail of the arrow symbol flat side of the triangle where current flows into the device note the electrode naming for diodes is always based on the direction of the forward current that of the arrow in which the current flows most easily even for types such as zener diodes or solar cells where the current of interest is the reverse current in vacuum tubes or gas filled tubes the anode is the terminal where current enters the tube etymology the word was coined in from the greek ἄνοδος anodos ascent by william whewell who had been consulted by michael faraday over some new names needed to complete paper on the recently discovered process of electrolysis in that paper faraday explained that when an electrolytic cell is oriented so that electric current traverses the decomposing body electrolyte in direction from east to west or which will strengthen this help to the memory that in which the sun appears to move the anode is where the current enters the electrolyte on the east side ano upwards odos way the way which the sun rises the use of east to mean the in direction actually in east sunrise up may appear contrived previously as related in the first reference cited above faraday had used the more straightforward term eisode the doorway where the current enters his motivation for changing it to something meaning the east electrode other candidates had been eastode oriode and anatolode was to make it immune to possible later change
