hearing aid assistive technology at is assistive adaptive and rehabilitative devices for people with disabilities or the elderly population people who have disabilities often have difficulty performing activities of daily living adls independently or even with assistance adls are self care activities that include toileting mobility ambulation eating bathing dressing grooming and personal device care assistive technology can ameliorate the effects of disabilities that limit the ability to perform adls assistive technology promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks they were formerly unable to accomplish or had great difficulty accomplishing by providing enhancements to or changing methods of interacting with the technology needed to accomplish such tasks for example wheelchairs provide independent mobility for those who cannot walk while assistive eating devices can enable people who cannot feed themselves to do so due to assistive technology people with disabilities have an opportunity of more positive and easygoing lifestyle with an increase in social participation security and control and greater chance to reduce institutional costs without significantly increasing household expenses adaptive technology adaptive technology and assistive technology are different assistive technology is something that is used to help individuals with disabilities while adaptive technology covers items that are specifically designed for people with disabilities and would seldom be used by non disabled person in other words assistive technology is any object or system that helps people with disabilities while adaptive technology is specifically designed for people with disabilities consequently adaptive technology is subset of assistive technology adaptive technology often refers specifically to electronic and information technology access occupational therapy occupational therapy ot is healthcare profession that specializes in maintaining or improving the quality of life for individuals that experience challenges when independently performing life occupations according to the occupational therapy practice framework domain and process rd ed aota occupations include areas related to all basic and instrumental activities of daily living adls rest and sleep education work play leisure and social participation occupational therapists have the specialized skill of employing assistive technology at in the improvement and maintenance of optimal functional participation in occupations the application of at enables an individual to adapt aspects of the environment that may otherwise be challenging to the user in order to optimize functional participation in those occupations as result occupational therapists may educate recommend and promote the use of at to improve the quality of life for their clients mobility impairments wheelchair propelled by attached handcycle wheelchairs wheelchairs are devices that can be manually propelled or electrically propelled and that include seating system and are designed to be substitute for the normal mobility that most people have wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility related activities of daily living which include feeding toileting dressing grooming and bathing the devices come in number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through joystick sip and puff control head switches or other input devices often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness injury or disability people with both sitting and walking disability often need to use wheelchair or walker newer advancements in wheelchair design enable wheelchairs to climb stairs go off road or propel using segway technology or additional add ons like handbikes or power assists power add on transfer devices patient transfer devices generally allow patients with impaired mobility to be moved by caregivers between beds wheelchairs commodes toilets chairs stretchers shower benches automobiles swimming pools and other patient support systems radiology surgical or examining tables the most common devices are patient lifts for vertical transfer transfer benches stretcher or convertible chairs for lateral supine transfer sit to stand lifts for moving patients from one seated position to another from wheelchairs to commodes air bearing inflatable mattresses for supine transfer transfer from gurney to an operating room table and sliding boards usually used for transfer from bed to wheelchair highly dependent patients who cannot assist their caregiver in moving them often require patient lift floor or ceiling suspended sling lift which though invented in and in common use since the early is still considered the state of the art transfer device by osha and the american nursing association walkers walker or walking frame or rollator is tool for disabled people who need additional support to maintain balance or stability while walking it consists of frame that is about waist high approximately twelve inches deep and slightly wider than the user walkers are also available in other sizes such as for children or for heavy people modern walkers are height adjustable the front two legs of the walker may or may not have wheels attached depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it it is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of walker with wheels on the front prosthesis prosthesis prosthetic or prosthetic limb is device that replaces missing body part it is part of the field of biomechatronics the science of using mechanical devices with human muscle skeleton and nervous systems to assist or enhance motor control lost by trauma disease or defect prostheses are typically used to replace parts lost by injury traumatic or missing from birth congenital or to supplement defective body parts inside the body artificial heart valves are in common use with artificial hearts and lungs seeing less common use but under active technology development other medical devices and aids that can be considered prosthetics include hearing aids artificial eyes palatal obturator gastric bands and dentures prostheses are specifically not orthoses although given certain circumstances prosthesis might end up performing some or all of the same functionary benefits as an orthosis prostheses are technically the complete finished item for instance leg knee alone is not prosthesis but only prosthetic component the complete prosthesis
