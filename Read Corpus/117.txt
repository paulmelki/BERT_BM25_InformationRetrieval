asterales is an order of dicotyledonous flowering plants that includes the large family asteraceae or compositae known for composite flowers made of florets and ten families related to the asteraceae the order is cosmopolite plants found throughout most of the world including desert and frigid zones and includes mostly herbaceous species although small number of trees such as the giant lobelia and the giant senecio and shrubs are also present asterales are organisms that seem to have evolved from one common ancestor asterales share characteristics on morphological and biochemical levels synapomorphies character that is shared by two or more groups through evolutionary development include the presence in the plants of oligosaccharide inulin nutrient storage molecule used instead of starch and unique stamen morphology the stamens are usually found around the style either aggregated densely or fused into tube probably an adaptation in association with the plunger brush or secondary pollination that is common among the families of the order wherein pollen is collected and stored on the length of the pistil taxonomy the name and order asterales is botanically venerable dating back to at least in the hutchinson system of plant taxonomy when it contained only five families of which only two are retained in the apg iii classification under the cronquist system of taxonomic classification of flowering plants asteraceae was the only family in the group but newer systems such as apg ii and apg iii have expanded it to in the classification system of dahlgren the asterales were in the superorder asteriflorae also called asteranae the order asterales currently includes families the largest of which are the asteraceae with about species and the campanulaceae bellflowers with about species the remaining families count together for less than species the two large families are cosmopolitan with many of their species found in the northern hemisphere and the smaller families are usually confined to australia and the adjacent areas or sometimes south america only the asteraceae have composite flower heads the other families do not but share other characteristics such as storage of inulin that define the families as more closely related to each other than to other plant families or orders such as the rosids the phylogenetic tree according to apg iii for the campanulid clade is as below biogeography the core asterales are stylidiaceae six genera apa clade alseuosmiaceae phellinaceae and argophyllaceae together genera mgca clade menyanthaceae goodeniaceae calyceraceae in total twenty genera and asteraceae about sixteen hundred genera other asterales are rousseaceae four genera campanulaceae eighty four genera and one genus all asterales families are represented in the southern hemisphere however asteraceae and campanulaceae are cosmopolitan and menyanthaceae nearly so evolution although most extant species of asteraceae are herbaceous the examination of the basal members in the family suggests that the common ancestor of the family was an arborescent plant tree or shrub perhaps adapted to dry conditions radiating from south america less can be said about the asterales themselves with certainty although since several families in asterales contain trees the ancestral member is most likely to have been tree or shrub because all clades are represented in the southern hemisphere but many not in the northern hemisphere it is natural to conjecture that there is common southern origin to them asterales are angiosperms flowering plants that appeared about million years ago the asterales order probably originated in the cretaceous mya on the supercontinent gondwana which broke up from mya forming the area that is now australia south america africa india and antarctica asterales contain about of eudicot diversity from an analysis of relationships and diversities within the asterales and with their superorders estimates of the age of the beginning of the asterales have been made which range from mya to mya however few fossils have been found of the menyanthaceae asteraceae clade in the oligocene about mya fossil evidence of the asterales is rare and belongs to rather recent epochs so the precise estimation of the order age is quite difficult an oligocene mya pollen is known for asteraceae and goodeniaceae and seeds from oligocene and miocene mya are known for menyanthaceae and campanulaceae respectively economic importance the asterales by dint of being super set of the family asteraceae include some species grown for food including the sunflower helianthus annuus lettuce lactuca sativa and chicory cichorium many are also used as spices and traditional medicines asterales are common plants and have many known uses for example pyrethrum derived from old world members of the genus chrysanthemum is natural insecticide with minimal environmental impact wormwood derived from genus that includes the sagebrush is used as source of flavoring for absinthe bitter classical liquor of european origin references citations general references judd campbell kellogg stevens donoghue plant
