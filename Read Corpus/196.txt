wheatstone michael faraday and the author charles dickens contacts which she used to further her education ada described her approach as poetical science and herself as an analyst metaphysician when she was teenager her mathematical talents led her to long working relationship and friendship with fellow british mathematician charles babbage who is known as the father of computers she was in particular interested in babbage work on the analytical engine lovelace first met him in june through their mutual friend and her private tutor mary somerville between and ada translated an article by italian military engineer luigi menabrea on the calculating engine supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes simply called notes lovelace notes are important in the early history of computers containing what many consider to be the first computer program that is an algorithm designed to be carried out by machine other historians reject this perspective and point out that babbage personal notes from the years contain the first programs for the engine she also developed vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number crunching while many others including babbage himself focused only on those capabilities her mindset of poetical science led her to ask questions about the analytical engine as shown in her notes examining how individuals and society relate to technology as collaborative tool she died of uterine cancer in at the age of biography childhood lord byron expected his child to be glorious boy and was disappointed when lady byron gave birth to girl the child was named after byron half sister augusta leigh and was called ada by byron himself on january at lord byron command lady byron left for her parents home at kirkby mallory
