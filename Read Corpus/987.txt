an illustration of anal sex anal sex or anal intercourse is generally the insertion and thrusting of the erect penis into person anus or anus and rectum for sexual pleasure other forms of anal sex include fingering the use of sex toys for anal penetration oral sex performed on the anus anilingus and pegging although anal sex most commonly means penileanal penetration sources sometimes use anal intercourse to exclusively denote penileanal penetration and anal sex to denote any form of anal sexual activity especially between pairings as opposed to anal masturbation while anal sex is commonly associated with male homosexuality research shows that not all gay males engage in anal sex and that it is not uncommon in heterosexual relationships types of anal sex can also be part of lesbian sexual practices people may experience pleasure from anal sex by stimulation of the anal nerve endings and orgasm may be achieved through anal penetration by indirect stimulation of the prostate in men indirect stimulation of the clitoris or an area of the vagina sometimes called the spot in women and other sensory nerves especially the pudendal nerve however people may also find anal sex painful sometimes extremely so which may be due to psychological factors in some cases as with most forms of sexual activity anal sex participants risk contracting sexually transmitted infections stis anal sex is considered high risk sexual practice because of the vulnerability of the anus and rectum the anal and rectal tissues are delicate and do not provide lubrication like the vagina does so they can easily tear and permit disease transmission especially if personal lubricant is not used anal sex without protection of condom is considered the riskiest form of sexual activity and therefore health authorities such as the world health organization who recommend safe sex practices for anal sex strong views are often expressed about anal sex it is controversial in various cultures especially with regard to religious prohibitions this is commonly due to prohibitions against anal sex among males or teachings about the procreative purpose of sexual activity it may be considered taboo or unnatural and is criminal offense in some countries punishable by corporal or capital punishment by contrast anal sex may also be considered natural and valid form of sexual activity as fulfilling as other desired sexual expressions and can be an enhancing or primary element of person sex life anatomy and stimulation male genital anatomy showing the location of the prostate with respect to the rectum the abundance of nerve endings in the anal region and rectum can make anal sex pleasurable for men or women the internal and external sphincter muscles control the opening and closing of the anus these muscles which are sensitive membranes made up of many nerve endings facilitate pleasure or pain during anal sex human sexuality an encyclopedia states that the inner third of the anal canal is less sensitive to touch than the outer two thirds but is more sensitive to pressure and that the rectum is curved tube about eight or nine inches long and has the capacity like the anus to expand research indicates that anal sex occurs significantly less frequently than other sexual behaviors but its association with dominance and submission as well as taboo makes it an appealing stimulus to people of all sexual orientations in addition to sexual penetration by the penis people may use sex toys such as dildo butt plug or anal beads engage in fingering anilingus pegging anal masturbation or fisting for anal sexual activity and different sex positions may also be included fisting is the least practiced of the activities partly because it is uncommon that people can relax enough to accommodate an object as big as fist being inserted into the anus in male receptive partner being anally penetrated can produce pleasurable sensation due to the inserted penis rubbing or brushing against the prostate through the anal wall this can result in pleasurable sensations and can lead to an orgasm in some cases prostate stimulation can produce deeper orgasm sometimes described by men as more widespread and intense longer lasting and allowing for greater feelings of ecstasy than orgasm elicited by penile stimulation only the prostate is located next to the rectum and is the larger more developed male homologue variation to the female skene glands it is also typical for man to not reach orgasm as receptive partner solely from anal sex general statistics indicate that of women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm the vaginal walls contain significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris which has many nerve endings specifically intended for orgasm and therefore intense sexual pleasure including orgasm from vaginal sexual stimulation is less likely to occur than from direct clitoral stimulation in the majority of women the clitoris is composed of more than the externally visible glans head the vagina for example is flanked on each side by the clitoral crura the internal legs of the clitoris which are highly sensitive and become engorged with blood when sexually aroused indirect stimulation of the clitoris through anal penetration may be caused by the shared sensory nerves especially the pudendal nerve which gives off the inferior anal nerves and divides into the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris although the anus has many nerve endings their purpose is not specifically for inducing orgasm and so woman achieving orgasm solely by anal stimulation is rare the gr√§fenberg spot or spot is debated area of female anatomy particularly among doctors and researchers but it is typically described as being located behind the female pubic bone surrounding the urethra and accessible through the anterior wall of the vagina it and other areas of the vagina are considered to have tissue and nerves that are related to the clitoris direct stimulation of the clitoris spot area or both while engaging in anal sex can help some women enjoy the activity and reach orgasm during it stimulation from anal sex can additionally
