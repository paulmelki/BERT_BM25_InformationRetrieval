the alkali metals consist of the chemical elements lithium li sodium na potassium rubidium rb caesium cs and francium fr together with hydrogen they constitute group which lies in the block of the periodic table all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an orbital this shared electron configuration results in their having very similar characteristic properties indeed the alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table with elements exhibiting well characterised homologous behaviour this family of elements is also known as the lithium family after its leading element the alkali metals are all shiny soft highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge they can all be cut easily with knife due to their softness exposing shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen and in the case of lithium nitrogen because of their high reactivity they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free elements caesium the fifth alkali metal is the most reactive of all the metals all the alkali metals react with water with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones all of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds in order of abundance sodium is the most abundant followed by potassium lithium rubidium caesium and finally francium which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity francium occurs only in minute traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium uue which is likely to be the next member of the group none was successful however ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects which are predicted to have large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues most alkali metals have many different applications one of the best known applications of the pure elements is the use of rubidium and caesium in atomic clocks of which caesium atomic clocks form the basis of the second common application of the compounds of sodium is the sodium vapour lamp which emits light very efficiently table salt or sodium chloride has been used since antiquity lithium finds use as psychiatric medication and as an anode in lithium batteries sodium and potassium are also essential elements having major biological roles as electrolytes and although the other alkali metals are not essential they also have various effects on the body both beneficial and harmful history petalite the lithium mineral from which lithium was first isolated sodium compounds have been known since ancient times salt sodium chloride has been an important commodity in human activities as testified by the english word salary referring to salarium money paid to roman soldiers for the purchase of salt while potash has been used since ancient times it was not understood for most of its history to be fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts georg ernst stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in and henri louis duhamel du monceau was able to prove this difference in the exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium was not known then and thus antoine lavoisier did not include either alkali in his list of chemical elements in pure potassium was first isolated in in england by humphry davy who derived it from caustic potash koh potassium hydroxide by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile previous attempts at electrolysis of the aqueous salt were unsuccessful due to potassium extreme reactivity potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis later that same year davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda naoh lye by similar technique demonstrating the elements and thus the salts to be different johann wolfgang döbereiner was among the first to notice similarities between what are now known as the alkali metals petalite li al si was discovered in by the brazilian chemist josé bonifácio de andrada in mine on the island of utö sweden however it was not until that johan august arfwedson then working in the laboratory of the chemist jöns jacob berzelius detected the presence of new element while analysing petalite ore this new element was noted by him to form compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline than the other alkali metals berzelius gave the unknown material the name lithion lithina from the greek word λιθoς transliterated as lithos meaning stone to reflect its discovery in solid mineral as opposed to potassium which had been discovered in plant ashes and sodium which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood he named the metal inside the material lithium lithium sodium and potassium were part of the discovery of periodicity as they are among series of triads of elements in the same group that were noted by johann wolfgang döbereiner in as having similar properties lepidolite the rubidium mineral from which rubidium was first isolated rubidium and caesium were the first elements to be discovered using the spectroscope invented in by robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff the next year they discovered caesium in the mineral water from bad dürkheim germany their discovery of rubidium came the following year in heidelberg germany finding it in the mineral lepidolite the names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra bright red line for rubidium from the latin word rubidus meaning dark red
