abae abai was an ancient town in the northeastern corner of ancient phocis in greece near the frontiers of the opuntian locrians said to have been built by the argive abas son of lynceus and hypermnestra and grandson of danaus this bit of legend suggests an origin or at least an existence in the bronze age its protohistory supports continued existence in iron age antiquity it was famous for its oracle of apollo abaeus one of those consulted by croesus king of lydia and mardonius among others the site of the oracle was rediscovered at kalapodi and excavated in modern times the results confirm an archaeological existence dating from the bronze age as is suggested by the lore history before the persian invasion the temple was richly adorned with treasuries and votive offerings it was twice destroyed by fire the first time by the persians in the invasion of xerxes in their march through phocis bce and second time by the boeotians in the sacred or phocian war in bce it was rebuilt by hadrian hadrian caused smaller temple to be built near the ruins of the former one in the new temple there were three ancient statues in brass of apollo leto and artemis which had been dedicated by the abaei and had perhaps been saved from the former temple the ancient agora and the ancient theatre still existed in the town in the time of pausanias according to the statement of aristotle as preserved by strabo thracians from the phocian town of abae emigrated to euboea and gave to the inhabitants the name of abantes oracle despite destruction of the town the oracle was still consulted by the thebans before the battle of leuctra in bce the temple along with the village of the same name may have escaped destruction during the third sacred war bce due to the respect given to the inhabitants however it was in very dilapidated state when seen by pausanias in the nd century ce though some restoration as well as the building of new temple was undertaken by emperor hadrian the sanctity of the shrine ensured certain privileges to the people of abae and these were confirmed by the romans the persians did not reflect this opinion and would destroy all the temples that they overcame abae included the greek pledged to not rebuild them as memorial of the ravages of the persians among the most exciting recent archaeological discoveries in greece is the recognition that the sanctuary site near the modern village of kalapodi is not only the site of the oracle of apollon at abae but that it was in constant use for cult practices from early mycenaean times to the roman period it is thus the first site where the archaeology confirms the continuity of mycenaean and classical greek religion which has been inferred from the presence of the names of classical greek divinities on linear texts from pylos and knossos the fortified site described below originally identified as abae by colonel william leake in the th century is much more likely to be that of the sanctuary of artemis at hyampolis the polygonal walls of the acropolis may still be seen in fair state of preservation on circular hill standing about above the little plain of exarcho one gateway remains and there are also traces of town walls below the temple site was on low spur of the hill below the town an early terrace wall supports precinct in which are stoa and some remains of temples these were excavated by the british school at athens in but little was found attribution notes references reference bibliography external links german archaeological institute german part documentary series german excavation archive of the british school at athens and école française athènes english and french
