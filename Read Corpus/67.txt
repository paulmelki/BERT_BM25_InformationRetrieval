sir john tenniel illustration of the caterpillar for lewis carroll alice adventures in wonderland is noted for its ambiguous central figure whose head can be viewed as being human male face with pointed nose and chin or as being the head end of an actual caterpillar with the first two right true legs visible ambiguity is type of meaning in which phrase statement or resolution is not explicitly defined making several interpretations plausible common aspect of ambiguity is uncertainty it is thus an attribute of any idea or statement whose intended meaning cannot be definitively resolved according to rule or process with finite number of steps the ambi part of the term reflects an idea of two as in two meanings the concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with vagueness in ambiguity specific and distinct interpretations are permitted although some may not be immediately obvious whereas with information that is vague it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity context may play role in resolving ambiguity for example the same piece of information may be ambiguous in one context and unambiguous in another linguistic forms lexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity the former represents choice between finite number of known and meaningful context dependent interpretations the latter represents choice between any number of possible interpretations none of which may have standard agreed upon meaning this form of ambiguity is closely related to vagueness linguistic ambiguity can be problem in law because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance structural analysis of an ambiguous spanish sentence pepe vio pablo enfurecido interpretation when pepe was angry then he saw pepe saw that pablo was angry here the syntactic tree in figure represents interpretation lexical ambiguity the lexical ambiguity of word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs meaning here refers to whatever should be captured by good dictionary for instance the word bank has several distinct lexical definitions including financial institution and edge of river or consider apothecary one could say bought herbs from the apothecary this could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary pharmacist or went to the apothecary pharmacy the context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended if for instance someone says buried in the bank most people would not think someone used shovel to dig in the mud however some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate used word lexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with word in context task referred to as word sense disambiguation the use of multi defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning in which case less ambiguous term should have been used the goal of clear concise communication is that the receiver have no about what was meant to be conveyed an exception to this could include politician whose weasel words and obfuscation are necessary to gain support from multiple constituents with mutually exclusive conflicting desires from their candidate of choice ambiguity is powerful tool of political science more problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts good for example can mean useful or functional that good hammer exemplary she good student pleasing this is good soup moral good person versus the lesson to be learned from story righteous etc have good daughter is not clear about which sense is intended the various ways to apply prefixes and suffixes can also create ambiguity unlockable can mean capable of being unlocked or impossible to lock semantic and syntactic ambiguity semantic ambiguity occurs when word phrase or sentence taken out of context has more than one interpretation in we saw her duck example due to richard nordquist the words her duck can refer either to the person bird the noun duck modified by the possessive pronoun her or to motion she made the verb duck the subject of which is the objective pronoun her object of the verb saw syntactic ambiguity arises when sentence can have two or more different meanings because of the structure of the sentence its syntax this is often due to modifying expression such as prepositional phrase the application of which is unclear he ate the cookies on the couch for example could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch as opposed to those that were on the table or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies to get in you will need an entrance fee of or your voucher and your drivers license this could mean that you need either ten dollars or both your voucher and your license or it could mean that you need your license and you need either ten dollars or voucher only rewriting the sentence or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve syntactic ambiguity for the notion of and theoretic results about syntactic ambiguity in artificial formal languages such as computer programming languages see ambiguous grammar usually semantic and syntactic ambiguity go hand in hand the sentence we saw her duck is also syntactically ambiguous conversely sentence like he ate the cookies on the couch is also semantically ambiguous rarely but occasionally the different parsings of syntactically ambiguous phrase result in the same meaning for example the command cook cook can be parsed as cook noun used as vocative cook imperative verb form but also as cook imperative verb form cook noun used as vocative it is more common that syntactically unambiguous phrase has semantic ambiguity for example the lexical ambiguity in your boss is funny man is purely semantic leading to the response funny ha ha or funny peculiar spoken language can contain many more types of ambiguities which are called phonological ambiguities where there is more than one way to compose set of sounds into
