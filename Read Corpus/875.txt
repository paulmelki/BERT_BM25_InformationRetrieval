the apicomplexa also called apicomplexia are large phylum of parasitic alveolates most of them possess unique form of organelle that comprises type of plastid called an apicoplast and an apical complex structure the organelle is an adaptation that the apicomplexan applies in penetration of host cell the apicomplexa are unicellular and spore forming all species are obligate endoparasites of animals except nephromyces symbiont in marine animals originally classified as chytrid fungus motile structures such as flagella or pseudopods are present only in certain gamete stages the apicomplexa are diverse group that includes organisms such as the coccidia gregarines piroplasms haemogregarines and plasmodia diseases caused by apicomplexa include babesiosis babesia malaria plasmodium cryptosporidium parvum cyclosporiasis cyclospora cayetanensis cystoisospora belli formerly known as isospora belli toxoplasmosis toxoplasma gondii the name of the taxon apicomplexa derives from two latin words apex top and complexus infolds and refers to set of organelles in the sporozoite the apicomplexa comprise the bulk of what used to be called the sporozoa group of parasitic protozoans in general without flagella cilia or pseudopods most of the apicomplexa are motile however by use of gliding mechanism that uses adhesions and small static myosin motors the other main lines were the ascetosporea now in rhizaria the myxozoa now known to be highly derived cnidarian animals and the microsporidia now known to be derived from fungi sometimes the name sporozoa is taken as synonym for the apicomplexa or occasionally as subset description apicomplexan structure polar ring conoid micronemes rhoptries nucleus nucleolus mitochondrion posterior ring alveoli golgi apparatus micropore some cell types ookinete sporozoite merozoite the phylum apicomplexa contains all eukaryotes with group of structures and organelles collectively termed the apical complex this complex consists of structural components and secretory organelles that are required for invasion of host cells during the parasitic stages of the apicomplexan life cycle apicomplexa have complex life cycles involving several stages and typically undergoing both asexual and sexual replication all apicomplexa are obligate parasites for some portion of their life cycle with some parasitizing two separate hosts for their asexual and sexual stages besides the conserved apical complex apicomplexa are morphologically diverse different organisms within apicomplexa as well as different life stages for given apicomplexan can vary substantially in size shape and subcellular structure like other eukaryotes apicomplexa have nucleus endoplasmic reticulum and golgi complex apicomplexa generally have single mitochondrion as well as another endosymbiont derived organelle called the apicoplast which maintains separate kilobase circular genome with the exception of cryptosporidium species and gregarina niphandrodes which lack an apicoplast all members of this phylum have an infectious stage the sporozoite which possesses three distinct structures in an apical complex the apical complex consists of set of spirally arranged microtubules the conoid secretory body the rhoptry and one or more polar rings additional slender electron dense secretory bodies micronemes surrounded by one or two polar rings may also be present this structure gives the phylum its name further group of spherical organelles is distributed throughout the cell rather than being localized at the apical complex and are known as the dense granules these typically have mean diameter around Î¼m secretion of the dense granule content takes place after parasite invasion and localization within the parasitophorous vacuole and persists for several minutes flagella are found only in the motile gamete these are posteriorly directed and vary in number usually one to three basal bodies are present although hemosporidians and piroplasmids have normal triplets of microtubules in their basal bodies coccidians and gregarines have nine singlets the mitochondria have tubular cristae centrioles chloroplasts ejectile organelles and inclusions are absent the cell is surrounded by pellicle of three membrane layers the alveolar structure penetrated by micropores replication mitosis is usually closed with an intranuclear spindle in some species it is open at the poles cell division is usually by schizogony meiosis occurs in the zygote mobility apicomplexans have unique gliding capability which enables them to cross through tissues and enter and leave their host cells this gliding ability is made possible by the use of adhesions and small static myosin motors other features common to this phylum are lack of cilia sexual reproduction use of micropores for feeding and the production of oocysts containing sporozoites as the infective form transposons appear to be rare in this phylum but have been identified in the genera ascogregarina and eimeria life cycle most members have complex lifecycle involving both asexual and sexual reproduction typically host is infected via an active invasion by the parasites similar to entosis which divide to produce sporozoites that enter its cells eventually the cells burst releasing merozoites which infect new cells this may occur several times until gamonts are produced forming gametes that fuse to create new cysts many variations occur on this basic pattern however and many apicomplexa have more than one host the apical complex includes vesicles called rhoptries and micronemes which open at the anterior of the cell these secrete enzymes that allow the parasite to enter other cells the tip is surrounded by band of microtubules called the polar ring and among the conoidasida is also funnel of tubulin proteins called the conoid over the rest of the cell except for diminished mouth called the micropore the membrane is supported by vesicles called alveoli forming semirigid pellicle the presence of alveoli and other traits place the apicomplexa among group called the alveolates several related flagellates such as perkinsus and colpodella have structures similar to the polar ring and were formerly included here but most appear to be closer relatives of the dinoflagellates they are probably similar to the common ancestor of the two groups another similarity is that many apicomplexan cells contain single plastid called the apicoplast surrounded by either three or four membranes its functions are thought to include tasks such as lipid and heme biosynthesis and it appears to be necessary for survival in general plastids are considered to have common origin with the chloroplasts of dinoflagellates and evidence points to an origin
