advanced micro devices inc amd is an american multinational semiconductor company based in santa clara california that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets while it initially manufactured its own processors the company later outsourced its manufacturing practice known as going fabless after globalfoundries was spun off in amd main products include microprocessors motherboard chipsets embedded processors and graphics processors for servers workstations personal computers and embedded system applications history amd former headquarters in sunnyvale california markham ontario canada formerly ati headquarters alt leed certified lone star campus in austin texas first twelve years advanced micro devices was formally incorporated by jerry sanders along with seven of his colleagues from fairchild semiconductor on may sanders an electrical engineer who was the director of marketing at fairchild had like many fairchild executives grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support opportunity and flexibility within the company and decided to leave to start his own semiconductor company robert noyce who had developed the first silicon integrated circuit at fairchild in had left fairchild together with gordon moore and founded the semiconductor company intel in july in september amd moved from its temporary location in santa clara to sunnyvale california to immediately secure customer base amd initially became second source supplier of microchips designed by fairchild and national semiconductor amd first focused on producing logic chips the company guaranteed quality control to united states military standard an advantage in the early computer industry since unreliability in microchips was distinct problem that customers including computer manufacturers the industry and instrument manufacturers wanted to avoid in november the company manufactured its first product the am bit msi shift register which began selling in also in amd produced its first proprietary product the am logic counter which was highly successful its best selling product in was the am the fastest multiplier available in amd entered the ram chip market beginning with the am bit bipolar ram that year amd also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits and by year end the company total annual sales reached us million amd went public in september the company was second source for intel mos lsi circuits by with products such as am and am dual bit dynamic shift registers by amd was producing products of which were proprietary including the am static channel bit ram and three low power schottky msi circuits am ls am ls and am ls intel had created the first microprocessor its bit in by amd entered the microprocessor market with the am reverse engineered clone of the intel and the am bit slice microprocessor family when intel began installing microcode in its microprocessors in it entered into cross licensing agreement with amd which was granted copyright license to the microcode in its microprocessors and peripherals effective october in amd entered into joint venture with siemens german engineering conglomerate wishing to enhance its technology expertise and enter the american market siemens purchased of amd stock giving the company an infusion of cash to increase its product lines the two companies also jointly established advanced micro computers amc located in silicon valley and in germany allowing amd to enter the microcomputer development and manufacturing field in particular based on amd second source zilog microprocessors when the two companies vision for advanced micro computers diverged amd bought out siemens stake in the american division in amd closed advanced micro computers in late after switching focus to manufacturing second source intel microprocessors total sales in fiscal year topped million and in amd debuted on the new york stock exchange in production also began on amd new semiconductor fabrication plant in austin texas the company already had overseas assembly facilities in penang and manila and began construction on fabrication plant in san antonio in in amd began supplying semiconductor products for an industry undergoing rapid expansion and innovation technology exchange agreement with intel intel had introduced the first microprocessors in in ibm created its pc and wanted intel processors but only under the condition that intel also provide second source manufacturer for its patented microprocessors intel and amd entered into year technology exchange agreement first signed in october and formally executed in february the terms of the agreement were that each company could acquire the right to become second source manufacturer of semiconductor products developed by the other that is each party could earn the right to manufacture and sell product developed by the other if agreed to by exchanging the manufacturing rights to product of equivalent technical complexity the technical information and licenses needed to make and sell part would be exchanged for royalty to the developing company the agreement also extended the amd intel cross licensing agreement through the agreement included the right to invoke arbitration of disagreements and after five years the right of either party to end the agreement with one year notice the main result of the agreement was that amd became second source manufacturer of intel microprocessors and related chips and intel provided amd with database tapes for its and chips beginning in amd began volume producing second source intel licensed and processors and by its own am clone of intel processor for the rapidly growing market of ibm pcs and ibm clones it also continued its successful concentration on proprietary bipolar chips in it introduced int std the highest manufacturing quality standard in the industry the company continued to spend greatly on research and development and in addition to other breakthrough products created the world first eprom in that year amd was listed in the book the best companies to work for in america and later made the fortune list for the first time in by mid the microchip market experienced severe downturn mainly due to long term aggressive trade practices dumping from japan but also due to crowded and non innovative chip market in the united states amd rode out the mid crisis by aggressively innovating and modernizing devising the liberty chip program
