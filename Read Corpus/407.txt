zero kelvins is defined as absolute zero absolute zero is the lowest limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale state at which the enthalpy and entropy of cooled ideal gas reach their minimum value taken as zero kelvins the fundamental particles of nature have minimum vibrational motion retaining only quantum mechanical zero point energy induced particle motion the theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the ideal gas law by international agreement absolute zero is taken as on the celsius scale international system of units which equals on the fahrenheit scale united states customary units or imperial units the corresponding kelvin and rankine temperature scales set their zero points at absolute zero by definition it is commonly thought of as the lowest temperature possible but it is not the lowest enthalpy state possible because all real substances begin to depart from the ideal gas when cooled as they approach the change of state to liquid and then to solid and the sum of the enthalpy of vaporization gas to liquid and enthalpy of fusion liquid to solid exceeds the ideal gas change in enthalpy to absolute zero in the quantum mechanical description matter solid at absolute zero is in its ground state the point of lowest internal energy the laws of thermodynamics indicate that absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means because the temperature of the substance being cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent asymptotically and system at absolute zero still possesses quantum mechanical zero point energy the energy of its ground state at absolute zero the kinetic energy of the ground state cannot be removed scientists and technologists routinely achieve temperatures close to absolute zero where matter exhibits quantum effects such as bose einstein condensate and superfluidity thermodynamics near absolute zero at temperatures near nearly all molecular motion ceases and for any adiabatic process where is the entropy in such circumstance pure substances can ideally form perfect crystals as max planck strong form of the third law of thermodynamics states the entropy of perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero in which perfect crystal is gone the original nernst heat theorem makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any isothermal process approaches zero as the implication is that the entropy of perfect crystal approaches constant value the nernst postulate identifies the isotherm as coincident with the adiabat although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct as no two adiabats intersect no other adiabat can intersect the isotherm consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature callen pp perfect crystal is one in which the internal lattice structure extends uninterrupted in all directions the perfect order can be represented by translational symmetry along three not usually orthogonal axes every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place whether it is single atom or molecular grouping for substances that exist in two or more stable crystalline forms such as diamond and graphite for carbon there is kind of chemical degeneracy the question remains whether both can have zero entropy at even though each is perfectly ordered perfect crystals never occur in practice imperfections and even entire amorphous material inclusions can and do get frozen in at low temperatures so transitions to more stable states do not occur using the debye model the specific heat and entropy of pure crystal are proportional to while the enthalpy and chemical potential are proportional to guggenheim these quantities drop toward their limiting values and approach with zero slopes for the specific heats at least the limiting value itself is definitely zero as borne out by experiments to below even the less detailed einstein model shows this curious drop in specific heats in fact all specific heats vanish at absolute zero not just those of crystals likewise for the coefficient of thermal expansion maxwell relations show that various other quantities also vanish these phenomena were unanticipated since the relation between changes in gibbs free energy the enthalpy and the entropy is thus as decreases and approach each other so long as is bounded experimentally it is found that all spontaneous processes including chemical reactions result in decrease in as they proceed toward equilibrium if and or are small the condition are the same in all scales the most transparent definition of this standard comes from the maxwell boltzmann distribution it can also be found in fermi dirac statistics for particles of half integer spin and bose einstein statistics for particles of integer spin all of these define the relative numbers of particles in system as decreasing exponential functions of energy at the particle level over kt with representing the boltzmann constant and representing the temperature observed at the macroscopic level negative temperatures temperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the familiar celsius or fahrenheit scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales certain systems can achieve truly negative temperatures that is their thermodynamic temperature expressed in kelvins can be of negative quantity system with truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero rather system with negative temperature is hotter than any system with positive temperature in the sense that if negative temperature system and positive temperature system come in contact heat flows from the negative to the positive temperature system most familiar systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always increases their entropy however some systems have maximum amount of energy that they can hold and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease because temperature is defined by the relationship between energy and entropy such system temperature becomes negative even though energy is being added as result the boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy therefore no complete system including the electromagnetic modes can have negative temperatures since there is no highest energy state so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures however for quasi equilibrium
