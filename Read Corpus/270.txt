an airbus on final assembly line in the airbus plant at hamburg finkenwerder airport hyundai car assembly line an assembly line is manufacturing process often called progressive assembly in which parts usually interchangeable parts are added as the semi finished assembly moves from workstation to workstation where the parts are added in sequence until the final assembly is produced by mechanically moving the parts to the assembly work and moving the semi finished assembly from work station to work station finished product can be assembled faster and with less labor than by having workers carry parts to stationary piece for assembly assembly lines are common methods of assembling complex items such as automobiles and other transportation equipment household appliances and electronic goods workers in charge of the works of assembly line are called assemblers concepts lotus cars assembly line as of assembly lines are designed for the sequential organization of workers tools or machines and parts the motion of workers is minimized to the extent possible all parts or assemblies are handled either by conveyors or motorized vehicles such as fork lifts or gravity with no manual trucking heavy lifting is done by machines such as overhead cranes or forklifts each worker typically performs one simple operation unless job rotation strategies are applied according to henry ford designing assembly lines is well established mathematical challenge referred to as assembly line balancing problem in the simple assembly line balancing problem the aim is to assign set of tasks which need to be performed on the work piece to sequence of workstations each task requires given task duration for completion the assignment of tasks to stations is typically limited by two constraints precedence graph which indicates what other tasks need to be completed before particular tasks can be initiated not putting in screw before drilling the hole and cycle time which restricts the sum of task processing times which can be completed at each workstation before the work piece is moved to the next station by the conveyor belt major planning problems for operating assembly lines include supply chain integration inventory control and production scheduling simple example consider the assembly of car assume that certain steps in the assembly line are to install the engine install the hood and install the wheels in that order with arbitrary interstitial steps only one of these steps can be done at time in traditional production only one car would be assembled at time if engine installation takes minutes hood installation takes five minutes and wheels installation takes minutes then car can be produced every minutes in an assembly line car assembly is split between several stations all working simultaneously when station is finished with car it passes it on to the next by having three stations three cars can be operated on at the same time each at different stage of assembly after finishing its work on the first car the engine installation crew can begin working on the second car while the engine installation crew works on the second car the first car can be moved to the hood station and fitted with hood then to the wheels station and be fitted with wheels after the engine has been installed on the second car the second car moves to the hood assembly at the same time the third car moves to the engine assembly when the third car engine has been mounted it then can be moved to the hood station meanwhile subsequent cars if any can be moved to the engine installation station assuming no loss of time when moving car from one station to another the longest stage on the assembly line determines the throughput minutes for the engine installation so car can be produced every minutes once the first car taking minutes has been produced history before the industrial revolution most manufactured products were made individually by hand single craftsman or team of craftsmen would create each part of product they would use their skills and tools such as files and knives to create the individual parts they would then assemble them into the final product making cut and try changes in the parts until they fit and could work together craft production division of labor was practiced in china where state run monopolies mass produced metal agricultural implements china armor and weapons centuries before mass production appeared in europe on the eve of the industrial revolution adam smith discussed the division of labour in the manufacture of pins at length in his book the wealth of nations published in the venetian arsenal dating to about operated similar to production line ships moved down canal and were fitted by the various shops they passed at the peak of its efficiency in the early th century the arsenal employed some people who could apparently produce nearly one ship each day and could fit out arm and provision newly built galley with standardized parts on an assembly line basis although the arsenal lasted until the early industrial revolution production line methods did not become common even then industrial revolution the industrial revolution led to proliferation of manufacturing and invention many industries notably textiles firearms clocks and watches horse drawn vehicles railway locomotives sewing machines and bicycles saw expeditious improvement in materials handling machining and assembly during the th century although modern concepts such as industrial engineering and logistics had not yet been named pulley block was the first manufacture to become fully automated at the portsmouth block mills in the early th century the automatic flour mill built by oliver evans in was called the beginning of modern bulk material handling by roe evans mill used leather belt bucket elevator screw conveyors canvas belt conveyors and other mechanical devices to completely automate the process of making flour the innovation spread to other mills and breweries probably the earliest industrial example of linear and continuous assembly process is the portsmouth block mills
