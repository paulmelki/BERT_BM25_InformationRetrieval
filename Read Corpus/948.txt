aedile from temple edifice was an elected office of the roman republic based in rome the aediles were responsible for maintenance of public buildings and regulation of public festivals they also had powers to enforce public order and duties to ensure the city of rome was well supplied and its civil infrastructure well maintained akin to modern local government there were two pairs of aediles the first were the plebeian aediles latin aediles plebis and possession of this office was limited to plebeians the other two were curule aediles latin aediles curules open to both plebeians and patricians in alternating years an aedilis curulis was classified as magister curulis the office of the aedilis was generally held by young men intending to follow the cursus honorum to high political office traditionally after their quaestorship but before their praetorship it was not compulsory part of the cursus and hence former quaestor could be elected to the praetorship without having held the position of aedile however it was an advantageous position to hold because it demonstrated the aspiring politician commitment to public service as well as giving him the opportunity to hold public festivals and games an excellent way to increase his name recognition and popularity history of the office plebeian aediles the plebeian aediles were created in the same year as the tribunes of the people bc originally intended as assistants to the tribunes they guarded the rights of the plebs with respect to their headquarters the temple of ceres subsequently they assumed responsibility for maintenance of the city buildings as whole their duties at first were simply ministerial they were the assistants to the tribunes in whatever matters that the tribunes might entrust to them although most matters with which they were entrusted were of minimal importance around bc they were given the authority to care for the decrees of the senate when was passed it would be transcribed into document and deposited in the public treasury the aerarium they were given this power because the consuls who had held this power before arbitrarily suppressed and altered the documents they also maintained the acts of the plebeian council popular assembly the plebiscites plebiscites once passed were also transcribed into physical document for storage while their powers grew over time it is not always easy to distinguish the difference between their powers and those of the censors occasionally if censor was unable to carry out one of his tasks an aedile would perform the task instead curule aediles according to livy vi after the passing of the licinian rogations in bc an extra day was added to the roman games the plebeian aediles refused to bear the additional expense whereupon the patricians offered to undertake it on condition that they were admitted to the aedileship the plebeians accepted the offer and accordingly two curule aediles were appointed at first from the patricians alone then from patricians and plebeians in turn lastly from either at the tribal assembly under the presidency of the consul curule aediles as formal magistrates held certain honors that plebeian aediles who were not technically magistrates did not hold besides having the right to sit on curule chair sella curulis and to wear toga praetexta the curule aediles also held the power to issue edicts jus edicendi these edicts often pertained to matters such as the regulation of the public markets or what we might call economic regulation livy suggests perhaps incorrectly that both curule as well as plebeian aediles were sacrosanct although the curule aediles always ranked higher than the plebeian their functions gradually approximated and became practically identical within five days after the beginning of their terms the four aediles two plebeian two curule were required to determine by lot or by agreement among themselves what parts of the city each should hold jurisdiction over differences between the two there was distinction between the two sets of aediles when it came to public festivals some festivals were plebeian in nature and thus were under the superintendence of plebeian aediles other festivals were supervised exclusively by the curule aediles and it was often with these festivals that the aediles would spend lavishly this was often done so as to secure the support of voters in future elections because aediles were not reimbursed for any of their public expenditures most individuals who sought the office were independently wealthy since this office was stepping stone to higher office and the senate it helped to ensure that only wealthy individuals mostly landowners would win election to high office these extravagant expenditures began shortly after the end of second punic war and increased as the spoils returned from rome new eastern conquests even the decadence of the emperors rarely surpassed that of the aediles under the republic as could have been seen during julius caesar aedileship election to the office plebeian aediles were elected by the plebeian council usually while under the presidency of plebeian tribune curule aediles were elected by the tribal assembly usually while under the presidency of consul since the plebeian aediles were elected by the plebeians rather than by all of the people of rome plebeians as well as members of the patrician aristocracy they were not technically magistrates before the passage of the lex annalis individuals could run for the aedileship by the time they turned twenty seven after the passage of this law in bc higher age was set probably thirty five by the st century bc aediles were elected in july and took office on the first day in january powers of the
