chinese abacus suanpan calculating table by gregor reisch margarita philosophica the woodcut shows arithmetica instructing an algorist and an abacist inaccurately represented as boethius and pythagoras there was keen competition between the two from the introduction of the algebra into europe in the th century until its triumph in the th the abacus plural abaci or abacuses also called counting frame is calculating tool that was in use in the ancient near east europe china and russia centuries before the adoption of the written arabic numeral system the exact origin of the abacus is still unknown the abacus essentially consists of number of rows of movable beads or other objects which represent digits one of two numbers is set up and the beads are manipulated to implement an operation involving second number addition or rarely square or cubic root in earliest use the rows of beads could be loose on flat surface or sliding in grooves later the beads were made to slide on rods of some sort built into frame allowing faster manipulation abacuses are still made often as bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires in the ancient world particularly before the introduction of positional notation abacuses were practical calculating tool there are distinctive modern implementations of the abacus some designs like the bead frame consisting of beads divided into tens are used mainly to teach arithmetic although they remain popular in the post soviet states as tool other designs such as the japanese soroban have been used for practical calculations even involving numbers of several digits for any particular abacus design there are usually numerous different methods to perform calculations which may include the four basic operations and also square and cube roots some of these methods work with non natural numbers numbers such as and although today calculators and computers are usually used instead of abacuses abacuses still remain in common use in some countries merchants traders and clerks in some parts of eastern europe russia china and africa use abacuses and they are still used to teach arithmetic to children some people who are unable to use calculator because of visual impairment may use an abacus etymology the use of the word abacus dates from before ad when middle english work borrowed the word from latin to describe sandboard abacus the latin word came from ancient greek abax which means something without base and improperly any piece of rectangular board or plank alternatively without reference to ancient texts on etymology it has been suggested that it means square tablet strewn with dust or drawing board covered with dust for the use of mathematics the exact shape of the latin perhaps reflects the genitive form of the greek word abakos while the table strewn with dust definition is popular some disagree saying that it is not proven greek itself is probably borrowing of northwest semitic language perhaps phoenician and cognate with the hebrew word ʾābāq or dust in post biblical sense meaning sand used as writing surface both abacuses and abaci soft or hard are used as plurals the user of an abacus is called an abacist history mesopotamian the period bc saw the first appearance of the sumerian abacus table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system some scholars point to character in babylonian cuneiform which may have been derived from representation of the abacus it is the belief of old babylonian scholars such as carruccio that old babylonians may have used the abacus for the operations of addition and subtraction however this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations egyptian the use of the abacus in ancient egypt is mentioned by the greek historian herodotus who writes that the egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left opposite in direction to the greek left to right method archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters however wall depictions of this instrument have not been discovered persian during the achaemenid empire around bc the persians first began to use the abacus under the parthian sassanian and iranian empires scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions with the countries around them india china and the roman empire when it is thought to have been exported to other countries greek an early photograph of the salamis tablet the original is marble and is held by the national museum of epigraphy in athens the earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the greek abacus dates to the th century bc also demosthenes bc bc talked of the need to use pebbles for calculations too difficult for your head play by alexis from the th century bc mentions an abacus and pebbles for accounting and both diogenes and polybius mention men that sometimes stood for more and sometimes for less like the pebbles on an abacus the greek abacus was table of wood or marble pre set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations this greek abacus saw use in achaemenid persia the etruscan civilization ancient rome and until the french revolution the western christian world tablet found on the greek island salamis in ad the salamis tablet dates back to bc making it the oldest counting board discovered so far it is slab of white marble long wide and thick on which are groups of markings in the center of the tablet is set of parallel lines equally divided by vertical line capped with semicircle at the intersection of the bottom most horizontal line and the single vertical line below these lines is wide space with horizontal crack dividing it below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines again divided into two sections by line perpendicular to them but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection the third sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with cross where they intersect with the vertical line also from this time frame the
