area settled by the alemanni and sites of roman alemannic battles rd to th centuries the alemanni also alamanni suebi swabians were confederation of germanic tribes on the upper rhine river first mentioned by cassius dio in the context of the campaign of caracalla of the alemanni captured the in and later expanded into present day alsace and northern switzerland leading to the establishment of the old high german language in those regions by the eighth century named alamannia in the alemanni were conquered by frankish leader clovis and incorporated into his dominions mentioned as still pagan allies of the christian franks the alemanni were gradually christianized during the seventh century the is record of their customary law during this period until the eighth century frankish suzerainty over alemannia was mostly nominal after an uprising by theudebald duke of alamannia though carloman executed the alamannic nobility and installed frankish dukes during the later and weaker years of the carolingian empire the alemannic counts became almost independent and struggle for supremacy took place between them and the bishopric of constance the chief family in alamannia was that of the counts of who were sometimes called margraves and one of whom burchard ii established the duchy of swabia which was recognized by henry the fowler in and became stem duchy of the holy roman empire the area settled by the alemanni corresponds roughly to the area where alemannic german dialects remain spoken including german swabia and baden french alsace german speaking switzerland liechtenstein and austrian vorarlberg the french language name of germany is derived from their name from old french aleman from french loaned into number of other languages including middle english which commonly used the term almains for germans likewise the arabic name for germany is المانيا almania the spanish is alemania the portuguese is alemanha welsh is yr almaen and persian is alman name according to gaius asinius quadratus quoted in the mid sixth century by byzantine historian agathias the name alamanni ἀλαμανοι means all men it indicates that they were conglomeration drawn from various germanic tribes the romans and the greeks called them as such mentioned this derivation was accepted by edward gibbon in his decline and fall of the roman empire and by the anonymous contributor of notes assembled from the papers of nicolas fréret published in this etymology has remained the standard derivation of the name an alternative suggestion proposes derivation from alah sanctuary walafrid strabo in the th century remarked in discussing the people of switzerland and the surrounding regions that only foreigners called them the alemanni but that they gave themselves the name of suebi the suebi are given the alternative name of ziuwari as cyuuari in an old high german gloss interpreted by jacob grimm as martem colentes worshippers of mars history first appearance in historical record alamannia is shown beyond silva marciana the black forest in the tabula peutingeriana suevia is indicated separately further downstream of the rhine beyond silva vosagus grave field at weingarten the alemanni were first mentioned by cassius dio describing the campaign of caracalla in at that time they apparently dwelt in the basin of the main to the south of the chatti cassius dio portrays the alemanni as victims of this treacherous emperor they had asked for his help according to dio but instead he colonized their country changed their place names and executed their warriors under pretext of coming to their aid when he became ill the alemanni claimed to have put hex on him caracalla it was claimed tried to counter this influence by invoking his ancestral spirits in retribution caracalla then led the legio ii traiana fortis against the alemanni who lost and were pacified for time the legion was as result honored with the name germanica the fourth century fictional historia augusta life of antoninus caracalla relates that caracalla then assumed the name alemannicus at which helvius pertinax jested that he should really be called geticus maximus because in the year before he had murdered his brother geta through much of his short reign caracalla was known for unpredictable and arbitrary operations launched by surprise after pretext of peace negotiations if he had any reasons of state for such actions they remained unknown to his contemporaries whether or not the alemanni had been previously neutral they were certainly further influenced by caracalla to become thereafter notoriously implacable enemies of rome this mutually antagonistic relationship is perhaps the reason why the roman writers persisted in calling the alemanni barbari meaning savages the archaeology however shows that they were largely romanized lived in roman style houses and used roman artifacts the alemannic women having adopted the roman fashion of the tunica even earlier than the men most of the alemanni were probably at the time in fact resident in or close to the borders of germania superior although dio is the earliest writer to mention them ammianus marcellinus used the name to refer to germans on the limes germanicus in the time of trajan governorship of the province shortly after it was formed around ad at that time the entire frontier was being fortified for the first time trees from the earliest fortifications found in germania inferior are dated by to ad ammianus relates xvii that much later the emperor julian undertook punitive expedition against the alemanni who by then were in alsace and crossed the main latin menus entering the forest where the trails were blocked by felled trees as winter was upon them they reoccupied fortification which was founded on the soil of the alemanni that trajan wished to be called with his own name in this context the use of alemanni is possibly an anachronism but it reveals that ammianus believed they were the same people which is consistent with the location of the alemanni of caracalla campaigns alemanni and hermunduri germania by tacitus ad in chapter states that the hermunduri were tribe certainly located in the region that later became thuringia tacitus
