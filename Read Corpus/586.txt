ambrosiaster is the name given to the writer of commentary on st paul epistles brief in words but weighty in matter and valuable for the criticism of the latin text of the new testament the commentary itself was written during the papacy of pope damasus that is between and and is considered an important document of the latin text of paul before the vulgate of jerome and of the interpretation of paul prior to augustine of hippo attribution this commentary was erroneously attributed for long time to st ambrose in though erasmus threw doubt on the accuracy of ascribing the authorship of this document to ambrose erasmus is generally falsely credited for having coined the name ambrosiaster literally in latin would be ambrose to describe its author the credit for this nickname should go to the maurists as rené hoven has shown the name has remained with the unknown author attempts to identify this ambrosiaster with known authors has continued but with no success because augustine cites ambrosiaster commentary on romans under the name of hilary many critics have attempted to identify ambroasiaster with one of the many writers named hilary active in the period in germain morin suggested that the writer was isaac converted jew and writer of tract on the trinity and incarnation who was exiled to spain in and then relapsed to judaism but he afterwards abandoned this theory of the authorship in favour of decimus hilarianus hilarius proconsul of africa in alternatively paolo angelo ballerini attempted to sustain the traditional attribution of the work to ambrose in his complete edition of that father work this is extremely problematic though since it would require ambrose to have written the book before he became bishop and then added to it in later years incorporating later remarks of hilary of poitiers on romans no identifications therefore have acquired lasting popularity with scholars and his identity remains mystery several other minor works have been attributed to this same author along with lengthy collection of exegetical and polemical tractates the quaestiones veteris et novi testamenti which manuscripts have traditionally ascribed to augustine in alexander souter established that this work should also be attributed to ambrosiaster fragments of several other works have been ascribed with some certainty to ambrosiaster commentary on matthew discussion of the parable of the three measures of flour into which woman placed yeast and treatment of peter denial and the arrest of jesus in gethsemane the attribution of other fragments to ambrosiaster though is more tentative life despite the elusive identity of ambrosiaster several facts about him can be established internal evidence suggests he was active at rome during the reign of pope damasus and almost certainly member of the roman clergy there are strong indications he objected to jerome efforts to revise the old latin versions of the gospels and that he was critical of jerome activity among ascetic women at rome ambrosiaster shows deep interest in judaism and often notes that christian practices derive from jewish tradition influence many scholars argue that ambrosiaster works were essentially pelagian although this is disputed pelagius cited him extensively for example alfred smith argued that pelagius view of predestination he seems to have taken from ambrosiaster his doctrine with regard to original sin appears to have come from the same source however augustine also made use of ambrosiaster commentaries notes bibliography texts heinrich joseph
