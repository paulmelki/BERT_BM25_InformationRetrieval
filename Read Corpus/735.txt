apollo was the eighth crewed mission in the united states apollo program the third to land on the moon and the first to land in the lunar highlands it was the last of the missions landings at specific sites of scientific interest on the moon for two day stays with two lunar extravehicular activities evas or moonwalks the mission was originally scheduled for but was postponed because of the investigation following the failure of apollo to reach the moon surface and the need for modifications to the spacecraft as result commander alan shepard command module pilot stuart roosa and lunar module pilot edgar mitchell launched on their nine day mission on sunday january at est following weather delay of forty minutes and two seconds en route to the lunar landing the crew overcame series of malfunctions that might have resulted in second consecutive aborted mission and possibly the premature end of the apollo program shepard and mitchell made their lunar landing on february in the fra mauro formation originally the target of apollo during the two walks on the surface of moon rocks were collected and several scientific experiments were deployed to the dismay of some geologists shepard and mitchell did not reach the rim of cone crater as had been planned though they came close in apollo most famous incident shepard hit two golf balls he had brought with him with makeshift club while shepard and mitchell were on the surface roosa remained in lunar orbit aboard the command and service module performing scientific experiments and photographing the moon including the landing site of the future apollo mission he took several hundred seeds on the mission many of which were germinated on return resulting in the so called moon trees that were widely distributed in the following years after liftoff from the surface and successful docking the spacecraft was flown back to earth where the three astronauts splashed down safely in the pacific ocean on february astronauts and key mission control personnel the mission commander of apollo alan shepard one of the original mercury seven astronauts became the first american to enter space with suborbital flight on may thereafter he was grounded by ménière disease disorder of the ear and served as chief astronaut the administrative head of the astronaut office he had experimental surgery in which was successful and allowed his return to flight status shepard at age was the oldest astronaut to fly when he made his trip aboard apollo and he is the oldest person to walk on the moon apollo command module pilot cmp stuart roosa aged when the mission flew had been smoke jumper before joining the air force in he became fighter pilot and then in successfully completed aerospace research pilot school arps at edwards air force base in california prior to his selection as group astronaut the following year he served as capsule communicator capcom for apollo the lunar module pilot lmp edgar mitchell aged at the time of apollo joined the navy in and served as fighter pilot beginning in he was assigned to squadrons aboard aircraft carriers before returning to the united states to further his education while in the navy also completing the arps prior to his selection as group astronaut he served on the support crew for apollo and was the lmp of the backup crew for apollo shepard and his crew had originally been designated by deke slayton director of flight crew operations and one of the mercury seven as the crew for apollo nasa management felt that shepard needed more time for training given he had not flown in space since and chose him and his crew for apollo instead the crew originally designated for apollo jim lovell as the commander ken mattingly as cmp and fred haise as lmp all of whom had backed up apollo was made the prime crew for apollo instead mitchell commander on the apollo backup crew had been another of the original seven gordon cooper who had tentatively been scheduled to command apollo but according to author andrew chaikin his casual attitude toward training resulted in his nonselection also on that crew but excluded from further flights was donn eisele likely because of problems aboard apollo which he had flown and because he had been involved in messy divorce apollo backup crew was eugene cernan as commander ronald evans jr as cmp and joe engle as lmp the backup crew with harrison schmitt replacing engle would become the prime crew of apollo schmitt flew instead of engle because there was intense pressure on nasa to fly scientist to the moon schmitt was geologist and apollo was the last lunar flight engle who had flown the to the edge of outer space flew into space for nasa in on sts the second space shuttle flight during projects mercury and gemini each mission had prime and backup crew apollo commander james mcdivitt believed meetings that required member of the flight crew were being missed so for apollo third crew of astronauts was added known as the support crew usually low in seniority support crew members assembled the mission rules flight plan and checklists and kept them updated for apollo they were philip chapman bruce mccandless ii william pogue and gordon fullerton capcoms the individuals in mission control responsible for communications with the astronauts were evans mccandless fullerton and haise veteran of apollo which had aborted before reaching the moon haise put his training for that mission to use especially during the evas since both missions were targeted at the same place on the moon had haise walked on the moon he would have been the first group astronaut to do so an honor that went to mitchell the flight directors during apollo had one sentence job description the flight director may take any actions necessary for crew safety and mission success for apollo they were pete frank orange team glynn lunney black team milt windler maroon team and gerry griffin gold team
