apollo was the first crewed spacecraft to leave low earth orbit and also the first human spaceflight to reach another astronomical object namely the moon which the crew orbited without landing and then departed safely back to earth these three astronauts frank borman james lovell and william anders were the first humans to witness an earthrise apollo launched on december and was the second crewed spaceflight mission flown in the united states apollo space program after apollo which stayed in earth orbit apollo was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the saturn rocket and was the first human spaceflight from the kennedy space center located adjacent to cape kennedy air force station in florida originally planned as the second crewed apollo lunar module and command module test to be flown in an elliptical medium earth orbit in early the mission profile was changed in august to more ambitious command module only lunar orbital flight to be flown in december as the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight astronaut jim mcdivitt crew who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low earth orbit became the crew for the apollo mission and borman crew were moved to the apollo mission this left borman crew with two to three months less training and preparation time than originally planned and replaced the planned lunar module training with translunar navigation training apollo took hours almost three days to travel the distance to the moon the crew orbited the moon ten times over the course of twenty hours during which they made christmas eve television broadcast in which they read the first ten verses from the book of genesis at the time the broadcast was the most watched tv program ever apollo successful mission paved the way for apollo to fulfill president john kennedy goal of landing man on the moon before the end of the the apollo astronauts returned to earth on december when their spacecraft splashed down in the northern pacific ocean the crew members were named time magazine men of the year for upon their return background in the late and early the united states was engaged in the cold war geopolitical rivalry with the soviet union on october the soviet union launched sputnik the first artificial satellite this unexpected success stoked fears and imaginations around the world it not only demonstrated that the soviet union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over distances it challenged american claims of military economic and technological superiority the launch precipitated the sputnik crisis and triggered the space race president john kennedy believed that not only was it in the national interest of the united states to be superior to other nations but that the perception of american power was at least as important as the actuality it was therefore intolerable to him for the soviet union to be more advanced in the field of space exploration he was determined that the united states should compete and sought challenge that maximized its chances of winning the soviet union had better booster rockets which meant kennedy needed to choose goal that was beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry one where the us and soviet union would be starting from position of equality something spectacular even if it could not be justified on military economic or scientific grounds after consulting with his experts and advisors he chose such project to land man on the moon and return him to the earth this project already had name project apollo an early and crucial decision was the adoption of lunar orbit rendezvous under which specialized spacecraft would land on the lunar surface the apollo spacecraft therefore had three primary components command module cm with cabin for the three astronauts and the only part that would return to earth service module sm to provide the command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and water and two stage lunar module lm which comprised descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to return the astronauts to lunar orbit this configuration could be launched by the saturn rocket that was then under development framework prime crew the initial crew assignment of frank borman as commander michael collins as command module pilot cmp and william anders as lunar module pilot lmp for the third crewed apollo flight was officially announced on november collins was replaced by jim lovell in july after suffering cervical disc herniation that required surgery to repair this crew was unique among pre space shuttle era missions in that the commander was not the most experienced member of the crew lovell had flown twice before on gemini vii and gemini xii this would also be the first case of commander of previous mission lovell gemini xii flying as non commander this was also the first mission to reunite crewmates from previous mission lovell and borman gemini vii as of all three apollo astronauts remain alive backup crew the backup crew assignment of neil armstrong as commander lovell as cmp and buzz aldrin as lmp for the third crewed apollo flight was officially announced at the same time as the prime crew when lovell was reassigned to the prime crew aldrin was moved to cmp and fred haise was brought in as backup lmp armstrong would later command apollo with aldrin as lmp and collins as cmp haise served on the backup crew of apollo as lmp and flew on apollo as lmp support personnel during projects mercury and gemini each mission had prime and backup crew for apollo third crew of astronauts was added known as the support crew the support crew maintained the flight plan checklists and mission ground rules and ensured that the prime and backup crews were apprised of any changes the support crew developed procedures in the simulators especially those for emergency situations so that the prime and backup crews could practice and master them in their simulator training for
