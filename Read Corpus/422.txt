acacia pronounced or known commonly as mimosa acacia thorntree or wattle is polyphyletic genus of shrubs and trees belonging to the subfamily mimosoideae of the family fabaceae it was described by the swedish botanist carl linnaeus in based on the african species acacia nilotica many non australian species tend to be thorny whereas the majority of australian acacias are not all species are pod bearing with sap and leaves often bearing large amounts of tannins and condensed tannins that historically found use as pharmaceuticals and preservatives the genus acacia constitutes in its traditional circumspection the second largest genus in fabaceae astragalus being the largest with roughly species about of them native to australia with the remainder spread around the tropical to warm temperate regions of both hemispheres including europe africa southern asia and the americas see list of acacia species the genus was divided into five separate genera under the tribe acacieae the genus now called acacia represents the majority of the australian species and few native to southeast asia r√©union and pacific islands most of the species outside australia and small number of australian species are classified into vachellia and senegalia the two final genera acaciella and mariosousa each contain about dozen species from the americas but see classification below for the ongoing debate concerning their taxonomy acacia tree near the limit of its range in the negev desert of southern israel golden wattle acacia pycnantha the floral emblem of australiaseed pods of acacia species from the mhnt classification english botanist and gardener philip miller adopted the name acacia in the generic name is derived from the name given by early greek botanist physician pedanius dioscorides middle to late first century to the medicinal tree nilotica in his book materia medica this name derives from the ancient greek word for its characteristic thorns thorn the species name nilotica was given by linnaeus from this tree best known range along the nile river this became the type species of the genus the traditional circumscription of acacia eventually contained approximately species however evidence began to accumulate that the genus as described was not monophyletic queensland botanist les pedley proposed the subgenus phyllodineae be renamed racosperma and published the binomial names this was taken up in new zealand but generally not followed in australia where botanists declared more study was needed eventually consensus emerged that acacia needed to be split as it was not monophyletic this led to australian botanists bruce maslin and tony orchard pushing for the retypification of the genus with an australian species instead of the original african type species an exception to traditional rules of priority that required ratification by the international botanical congress that decision has been controversial and debate continued with some taxonomists and many other biologists deciding to continue to use the traditional acacia sensu lato circumscription of the genus in defiance of decisions by an international botanical congress however second international botanical congress has now confirmed the decision to apply the name acacia to the mostly australian plants which some had been calling racosperma and which had formed the overwhelming majority of acacia sensu lato debate continues regarding the traditional acacias of africa possibly placed in senegalia and vachellia and some of the american species possibly placed in acaciella and mariosousa acacias belong to the subfamily mimosoideae the major clades of which may have formed in response to drying trends and fire regimes that accompanied increased seasonality during the late oligocene to early miocene mya pedley following vassal viewed acacia as comprising three large subgenera but subsequently raised the rank of these groups to genera acacia senegalia and racosperma which was underpinned by later genetic studies in common parlance the term acacia is occasionally applied to species of the genus robinia which also belongs in the pea family robinia pseudoacacia an american species locally known as black locust is sometimes called false acacia in cultivation in the united kingdom and throughout europe description acacia fasciculifera seedling in the transitional stage between pinnate leaves and phyllodes the leaves of acacias are compound pinnate in general in some species however more especially in the australian and pacific islands species the leaflets are suppressed and the leaf stalks petioles become vertically flattened in order to serve the purpose of leaves these are known as phyllodes the vertical orientation of the phyllodes protects them from intense sunlight since with their edges towards the sky and earth they do not intercept light as fully as horizontally placed leaves few species such as acacia glaucoptera lack leaves or phyllodes altogether but instead possess cladodes modified leaf like photosynthetic stems functioning as leaves the small flowers have five very small petals almost hidden by the long stamens and are arranged in dense globular or cylindrical clusters they are yellow or cream colored in most species whitish in some or even purple acacia purpureopetala or red acacia leprosa scarlet blaze acacia flowers can be distinguished from those of large related genus albizia by their stamens which are not joined at the base also unlike individual mimosa flowers those of acacia have more than ten stamens the plants often bear spines especially those species growing in arid regions these sometimes represent branches that have become short hard and pungent though they sometimes represent leaf stipules acacia armata is the kangaroo thorn of australia and acacia erioloba syn acacia eriolobata is the camelthorn of africa acacia seeds can be difficult to germinate research has found that immersing the seeds in various temperatures usually around and manual seed coat chipping can improve growth to around symbiosis acacia collinsii stipules swollen stipules of acacia drepanolobium that serve as ant domatia an entry hole can be seen at the base of one of the spines of the largest domatia from the mhnt in the central american bullthorn acacias acacia sphaerocephala acacia cornigera and acacia collinsii some of the spiny stipules are large swollen and hollow these afford shelter for several species of pseudomyrmex ants which feed on
