statue of an ammonite deified king on display at the jordan museum the statue was found near the amman citadel and is thought to date to th century bc an ammonite watch tower at rujm al malfouf in amman qasr al adb was built by the governor of ammon in bc david punishing the ammonites by gustave dor√© ammon was an ancient semitic speaking nation occupying the east of the jordan river between the torrent valleys of arnon and jabbok in present day jordan the chief city of the country was rabbah or rabbath ammon site of the modern city of amman jordan capital milcom and molech who may be one and the same are named in the hebrew bible as the gods of ammon the people of this kingdom are called children of ammon or ammonites history the ammonites occupied the northern central trans jordanian plateau from the latter part of the second millennium bc to at least the second century ce ammon maintained its independence from the neo assyrian empire through tribute to the assyrian king at time when nearby kingdoms were being raided or conquered the kurkh monolith lists the ammonite king baasha ben ruhubi army as fighting alongside ahab of israel and syrian allies against shalmaneser iii at the battle of qarqar in bc possibly as vassals of hadadezer the aramaean king of damascus in bc the ammonite king sanipu was vassal of tiglath pileser iii and sanipu successor pudu ilu held the same position under sennacherib and esarhaddon an assyrian tribute list exists from this period showing that ammon paid one fifth as much tribute as judah did somewhat later the ammonite king amminadab was among the tributaries who suffered in the course of the great arabian campaign of assurbanipal other kings attested to in contemporary sources are barachel attested to in several contemporary seals and hissalel the latter of whom reigned about bce hissalel is mentioned in an inscription on bottle found at tel siran jordan along with his son king amminadab ii who reigned around bce archaeology and history indicate that ammon flourished during the neo babylonian empire period this contradicts the view dominant for decades that transjordan was either destroyed by nebuchadnezzar ii or suffered rapid decline following judah destruction by that king newer evidence suggests that ammon enjoyed continuity from the neo babylonian to the persian period little mention is made of the ammonites through the persian and early hellenistic periods their name appears however during the time of the maccabees the ammonites with some of the neighboring tribes did their utmost to resist and check the revival of the jewish power under judas maccabaeus the dynast hyrcanus founded qasr al abd and was descendant of the seleucid tobiad dynasty of tobiah who is mentioned by nehemiah as an ammonite ii from the east jordanian district the last notice of the ammonites is in justin martyr dialogue with trypho in the second century where it is affirmed that they were still numerous people biblical account the first mention of the ammonites in the bible is in it is stated there that they descended from ben ammi son of lot through with his younger daughter who plotted with her sister to intoxicate lot and in his inebriated state have relations to become pregnant ben ammi literally means son of my people after the destruction of sodom and gomorrah the daughters of lot wanted to have child and carried out plot to intoxicate him and had relations resulting in ammon and his half brother moab being conceived and born this narrative has traditionally been considered literal fact but is now generally interpreted as recording gross popular irony by which the israelites expressed their loathing of the morality of the moabites and ammonites it has been doubted however whether the israelites would have directed such irony to lot himself the ammonites settled to the east of the jordan invading the rephaim lands east of jordan between the jabbok and arnon dispossessing them and dwelling in their place their territory originally comprising all from the jordan to the wilderness and from the river jabbok south to the river arnon it was accounted land of giants and that giants formerly dwelt in it whom the ammonites called zamzummim shortly before the israelite exodus the amorites west of jordan under king sihon invaded and occupied large portion of the territory of moab and ammon the ammonites were driven from the rich lands near the jordan and retreated to the mountains and valleys to the east the invasion of the amorites created wedge and separated the two kingdoms of ammon and moab throughout the bible the ammonites and the israelites are portrayed as mutual antagonists during the exodus the israelites were prohibited by the ammonites from passing through their lands the ammonites soon allied themselves with eglon of moab in attacking israel the ammonites maintained their claim to part of transjordan after it was occupied by the israelites who obtained it from sihon during the days of jephthah the ammonites occupied the lands east of the river jordan and started to invade israelite lands west of the river jephthah became the leader in resisting these incursions the constant harassment of the israelite communities east of the jordan by the ammonites was the impetus behind the unification of the tribes under saul king nahash of ammon bc lay siege to jabesh gilead this eventually led to an alliance with saul under his command the israelites relieved the siege and defeated the ammonite king eventually resulting in the formation of the israelite kingdom during the reign of king david the ammonites humiliated david messengers and hired the aramean armies to attack israel this eventually ended in war and year long siege of rabbah the capital of ammon the war ended with all the ammonite cities being conquered and plundered and the inhabitants being killed or put to forced labor at david command according to both and naamah was an ammonite
