snake lily dracunculus vulgaris of family araceae in crete greece ottelia alismoides from family in hyderabad india the alismatales alismatids are an order of flowering plants including about species plants assigned to this order are mostly tropical or aquatic some grow in fresh water some in marine habitats description the alismatales comprise herbaceous flowering plants of aquatic and marshy habitats and the only monocots known to have green embryos other than the amaryllidaceae they also include the only marine angiosperms growing completely submerged the seagrasses the flowers are usually arranged in inflorescences and the mature seeds lack endosperm both marine and freshwater forms include those with staminate flowers that detach from the parent plant and float to the surface where they become pollinated in others pollination occurs underwater where pollen may form elongated strands increasing chance of success most aquatic species have totally submerged juvenile phase and flowers are either floating or emergent vegetation may be totally submersed have floating leaves or protrude from the water collectively they are commonly known as water plantain taxonomy the alismatales contain about genera in families with cosmopolitan distribution they are basal monocots diverging early in evolution relative to the lilioid and commelinid monocot lineages together with the acorales the alismatales are referred to informally as the alismatid monocots early systems the cronquist system places the alismatales in subclass alismatidae class liliopsida monocotyledons and includes only three families as shown alismataceae butomaceae cronquist subclass alismatidae conformed fairly closely to the order alismatales as defined by apg minus the araceae the dahlgren system places the alismatales in the superorder alismatanae in the subclass liliidae monocotyledons in the class magnoliopsida angiosperms with the following families included alismataceae aponogetonaceae butomaceae in tahktajan classification the order alismatales contains only the alismataceae and making it equivalent to the alismataceae as revised in apg iii other families included in the alismatates as currently defined are here distributed among additional orders all of which are assigned with the following exception to the subclass alismatidae araceae in tahktajan is assigned to the arales and placed in the subclass aridae tofieldiaceae to the melanthiales and placed in the liliidae angiosperm phylogeny group the angiosperm phylogeny group system apg of and apg ii assigned the alismatales to the monocots which may be thought of as an unranked clade containing the families listed below the biggest departure from earlier systems see below is the inclusion of family araceae by its inclusion the order has grown enormously in number of species the family araceae alone accounts for about hundred genera totaling over two thousand species the rest of the families together contain only about five hundred species many of which are in very small families the apg iii system differs only in that the are combined with the alismataceae it was also suggested that the genus maundia of the juncaginaceae could be separated into monogeneric family the maundiaceae but the authors noted that more study was necessary before the maundiaceae could be recognized order alismatales sensu apg iii family alismataceae including family aponogetonaceae family araceae family butomaceae family cymodoceaceae family family juncaginaceae family posidoniaceae family family ruppiaceae family family tofieldiaceae family zosteraceae in apg iv it was decided that evidence was sufficient to elevate maundia to family level as the monogeneric maundiaceae the authors considered including number of the smaller orders within the juncaginaceae but an online survey of botanists and other users found little support for this lumping approach consequently the family structure for apg iv is family alismataceae including family aponogetonaceae family araceae family butomaceae family cymodoceaceae family family juncaginaceae family maundiaceae family posidoniaceae family family ruppiaceae family family tofieldiaceae family zosteraceae phylogeny cladogram showing the orders of monocots lilianae sensu chase reveal based on molecular phylogenetic evidence references further reading du mortier analyse des familles de plantes avec indication des principaux genres qui rattachent imprimerie de casterman tournay judd campbell kellogg stevens donoghue plant systematics phylogenetic approach nd edition sinauer associates sunderland massachusetts in external links
