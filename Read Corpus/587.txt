ambrosius aurelianus anglicised as ambrose aurelian and called aurelius ambrosius in the historia regum britanniae and elsewhere was war leader of the romano british who won an important battle against the anglo saxons in the th century according to gildas he also appeared independently in the legends of the britons beginning with the th century historia brittonum eventually he was transformed into the uncle of king arthur the brother of arthur father uther pendragon as ruler who precedes and predeceases them both he also appears as young prophet who meets the tyrant vortigern in this guise he was later transformed into the wizard merlin according to gildas ambrosius aurelianus is one of the few people that gildas identifies by name in his sermon de excidio et conquestu britanniae and the only one named from the th century de excidio is considered the oldest extant british document about the so called arthurian period of sub roman britain following the destructive assault of the saxons the survivors gather together under the leadership of ambrosius who is described as some basic information on ambrosius can be deduced from the brief passage ambrosius was possibly of high birth and very likely christian gildas says that he won his battles with god help ambrosius parents were slain by the saxons and he was among the few survivors of their initial invasion according to gildas ambrosius organised the survivors into an armed force and achieved the first military victory over the saxon invaders however this victory was not decisive sometimes the saxons and sometimes the citizens meaning the romano british inhabitants were victorious due to gildas description of him ambrosius is one of the figures called the last of the romans scholarship questions two points in gildas description have attracted much scholarly commentary the first is what gildas meant by saying ambrosius family had worn the purple roman emperors and male patricians wore clothes with purple band to denote their class so the reference to purple may be to an aristocratic heritage roman military tribunes tribuni militum senior officers in roman legions wore similar purple band so the reference may be to family background of military leadership the tradition was old as the togas and pallia of already ancient senators and tribunes were trimmed with the purple band in the church the purple is euphemism for blood and therefore wearing the purple may be reference to martyrdom or bishop robe in addition in the later roman empire both roman consuls and governors of consular rank also wore clothes with purple fringe the notitia dignitatum roman catalogue of official posts lists four or five provincial governors in roman britain and two of them were of consular rank one was the governor of maxima caesariensis and the other that of valentia the parent who wore the purple may well have been one of these governors whose names were not recorded it has been suggested by historian alex woolf that ambrosius may have been related to the th century romano british usurpers marcus or gratian woolf expresses preference based on nomenclature for marcus frank reno an arthurian scholar has instead argued that the name aurelianus indicates the possible descent of ambrosius from the roman emperor lucius domitius aurelianus aurelian reigned aurelian military campaigns included the conquest of the gallic empire higham suggests that ambrosius may have been distantly related to imperial families of the late roman empire such as the theodosian dynasty branches of this particular dynasty were known to be active in western roman provinces like hispania mike ashley instead focuses on the name ambrosius and its possible connection to saint ambrosius fourth century bishop of milan who also served as consular governor in areas of roman italy the father of the bishop is sometimes claimed to be fourth century praetorian prefect of gaul named aurelius ambrosius whose areas included britain though some modern scholars doubt that saint ambrosius was related to this man instead identifying his father with an official named uranius mentioned in an extract from the theodosian code ashley suggests that ambrosius aurelianus was related to the two aurelii ambrosii tim venning points out that the name aurelianus could be the result of roman adoption when boy was adopted into new gens clan he received the family names of his new family plus an additional cognomen indicating his descent from his original gens family the additional cognomen often had the form anus when gaius octavius from gens octavia was adopted into the julii caesares family his new name became gaius julius caesar octavianus in this case ambrosius may have been member of gens aurelia who was adopted by another gens family his original name aurelius became aurelianus the second question is the meaning of the word avita gildas could have meant ancestors or intended it to mean more specifically grandfather thus indicating ambrosius lived about generation before the battle of badon lack of information prevents sure answers to these questions gildas motives higham wrote book on gildas and the literary tropes that he used he has suggested that gildas may have had considerable motive for drawing attention to ambrosius he was not attempting to write historical biography of the man according to higham but setting him as an example to his contemporaries it was essential to the philosophy of gildas that briton leaders who achieved victory over the barbarians were only able to do so because of divine aid and only those who had superior christian virtues were deserving of this aid ambrosius aurelianus was apparently known for at least one such victory over the barbarians to fit him into his worldview gildas was almost required to feature the former warrior as man of exceptional virtues and obedience to god he was made to fit gildas version of model leader higham also suggests that the roman lineage of ambrosius was highlighted for reason gildas was apparently intentionally connecting him with the legitimate authority and military virtues of the romans he was also contrasting him with
