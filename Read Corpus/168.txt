an atom is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that forms chemical element every solid liquid gas and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms atoms are extremely small typically around picometers across they are so small that accurately predicting their behavior using classical physics as if they were tennis balls for example is not possible due to quantum effects every atom is composed of nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus the nucleus is made of one or more protons and number of neutrons only the most common variety of hydrogen has no neutrons more than of an atom mass is in the nucleus the protons have positive electric charge the electrons have negative electric charge and the neutrons have no electric charge if the number of protons and electrons are equal then the atom is electrically neutral if an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons then it has an overall negative or positive charge respectively such atoms are called ions the electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the electromagnetic force the protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by the nuclear force this force is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force that repels the positively charged protons from one another under certain circumstances the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force in this case the nucleus splits and leaves behind different elements this is form of nuclear decay the number of protons in the nucleus is the atomic number and it defines to which chemical element the atom belongs for example any atom that contains protons is copper the number of neutrons defines the isotope of the element atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by chemical bonds to form chemical compounds such as molecules or crystals the ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature chemistry is the discipline that studies these changes history of atomic theory in philosophy the basic idea that matter is made up of tiny indivisible particles is very old appearing in many ancient cultures such as greece and india this ancient idea was based in philosophical reasoning rather than scientific reasoning and modern atomic theory is not based on these old concepts the word atom is derived from the greek word atomos which means uncuttable dalton law of multiple proportions atoms and molecules as depicted in john dalton new system of chemical philosophy vol in the early an english chemist john dalton compiled experimental data gathered by himself and other scientists and discovered pattern now known as the law of multiple proportions he noticed that in chemical compounds which contain particular chemical element the content of that element in these compounds will differ by ratios of small whole numbers this pattern suggested to dalton that each chemical element combines with others by some basic and consistent unit of mass for example there are two types of tin oxide one is black powder that is tin and oxygen and the other is white powder that is tin and oxygen adjusting these figures in the black oxide there is about of oxygen for every of tin and in the white oxide there is about of oxygen for every of tin and form ratio of in these oxides for every tin atom there are one or two oxygen atoms respectively sno and sno as second example dalton considered two iron oxides black powder which is iron and oxygen and red powder which is iron and oxygen adjusting these figures in the black oxide there is about of oxygen for every of iron and in the red oxide there is about of oxygen for every of iron and form ratio of in these respective oxides for every two atoms of iron there are two or three atoms of oxygen fe and fe as final example nitrous oxide is nitrogen and oxygen nitric oxide is nitrogen and oxygen and nitrogen dioxide is nitrogen and oxygen adjusting the figures for every of nitrogen there is about and of oxygen in these oxides respectively which gives ratio of the respective formulas for these oxides are no and no kinetic theory of gases in the late th century number of scientists found that they could better explain the behavior of gases by describing them as collections of sub microscopic particles and modelling their behavior using statistics and probability unlike dalton atomic theory the kinetic theory of gases describes not how gases react chemically with each other to form compounds but how they behave physically diffusion viscosity conductivity pressure etc brownian motion in botanist robert brown used microscope to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically phenomenon that became known as brownian motion this was thought to be caused by water molecules knocking the grains about in albert einstein proved the reality of these molecules and their motions by producing the first statistical physics analysis of brownian motion french physicist jean perrin used einstein work to experimentally determine the mass and dimensions of molecules thereby providing physical evidence for the particle nature of matter discovery of the electron the geiger marsden experiment left expected results alpha particles passing through the plum pudding model of the atom with negligible deflection right observed results small portion of the particles were deflected by the concentrated positive charge of the nucleus in thomson discovered that cathode rays are not electromagnetic waves but made of particles that are times lighter than hydrogen the lightest atom thomson concluded that these particles came from the atoms within the cathode they were subatomic particles he called these new particles corpuscles but they were later renamed electrons thomson also showed that electrons were identical to particles given off by photoelectric and radioactive materials it was quickly recognized that electrons are the particles that carry electric currents in metal wires thomson concluded
