for piety and sanctity led to his promotion to the episcopate and eventually to his becoming archbishop ælfheah furthered the cult of dunstan and also encouraged learning he was captured by viking raiders in during the siege of canterbury and killed by them the following year after refusing to allow himself to be ransomed ælfheah was canonised as saint in thomas becket later archbishop of canterbury prayed to him just before his own murder in canterbury cathedral in life ælfheah was born around supposedly in weston on the outskirts of bath and became monk early in life he first entered the monastery of deerhurst but then moved to bath where he became an anchorite he was noted for his piety and austerity and rose to become abbot of bath abbey the th century chronicler william of malmesbury recorded that ælfheah was monk and prior at glastonbury abbey but this is not accepted by all historians indications are that ælfheah became abbot at bath by perhaps as early as around he perhaps shared authority with his predecessor æscwig after probably due to the influence of dunstan the archbishop of canterbury ælfheah was elected bishop of winchester in and was consecrated on october that year while bishop he was largely responsible for the construction of large organ in the cathedral audible from over mile away and said to require more than men to operate he also built and enlarged the city churches and promoted the cult of swithun and his own predecessor æthelwold of winchester one act promoting æthelwold cult was the translation of æthelwold body to new tomb in the cathedral at winchester which ælfheah presided over on september following viking raid in peace treaty was agreed with one of the raiders olaf tryggvason besides receiving danegeld olaf converted to christianity and undertook never to raid or fight the english again ælfheah may have played part in the treaty negotiations and it is certain that he confirmed olaf in his new faith in ælfheah succeeded ælfric as archbishop of canterbury taking swithun head with him as relic for the new location he went to rome in to receive his pallium symbol of his status as an archbishop from pope john xviii but was robbed during his journey while at canterbury he promoted the cult of dunstan ordering the writing of the second life of dunstan which adelard of ghent composed between and he also introduced new practices into the liturgy and was instrumental in the witenagemot recognition of wulfsige of sherborne as saint in about ælfheah sent ælfric of eynsham to cerne abbey to take charge of its monastic school he was present at the council of may at which wulfstan ii archbishop of york preached his sermo lupi ad anglos the sermon of the wolf to the english castigating the english for

ælfmaer whose life ælfheah had once saved the raiders succeeded in sacking the city ælfheah was taken prisoner and held captive for seven months godwine bishop of rochester leofrun abbess of st mildrith and the king reeve ælfweard were captured also but the abbot of st augustine abbey ælfmær managed to escape canterbury cathedral was plundered and burned by the danes following ælfheah capture death ælfheah refused to allow ransom to be paid for his freedom and as result was killed on april at greenwich then in kent now part of london reputedly on the site of st alfege church the account of ælfheah death appears in the version of the anglo saxon chronicle ælfheah was the first archbishop of canterbury to die violent death contemporary report tells that thorkell the tall attempted to save ælfheah from the mob about to kill him by offering everything he owned except for his ship in exchange for ælfheah life thorkell presence is not mentioned in the anglo saxon chronicle however some sources record that the final blow with the back of an axe was delivered as an act of kindness by christian convert known as thrum ælfheah was buried in st paul cathedral in his body was moved by king cnut to canterbury with great ceremony thorkell the tall was appalled at the brutality of his fellow raiders and switched sides to the english king æthelred the unready following ælfheah death veneration pope gregory vii canonised ælfheah in with feast day of april lanfranc the first post conquest archbishop was dubious about some of the saints venerated at canterbury he was persuaded of ælfheah sanctity but ælfheah and augustine of canterbury were the only pre conquest anglo saxon archbishops kept on canterbury calendar of saints ælfheah shrine which had become neglected was rebuilt and expanded in the early th century under anselm of canterbury who was instrumental in retaining ælfheah name in the church calendar after the fire in canterbury cathedral ælfheah remains together with those of dunstan were placed around the high altar at which thomas becket is said to have commended his life into ælfheah care shortly before his martyrdom during the becket controversy the new shrine was sealed in lead and was north of the high altar sharing the honour with dunstan shrine which was located south of the high altar life of saint ælfheah in prose and verse was written by canterbury monk named osbern at lanfranc request the prose version has survived but the life is very much hagiography many of the stories it contains have obvious biblical parallels making them suspect as historical record in the late medieval period ælfheah feast day was celebrated in scandinavia perhaps because of the saint connection with cnut few church dedications to him are
