applesoft basic is dialect of microsoft basic developed by marc mcdonald and ric weiland supplied with the apple ii series of computers it supersedes integer basic and is the basic in rom in all apple ii series computers after the original apple ii model it is also referred to as fp basic from floating point because of the apple dos command used to invoke it instead of int for integer basic applesoft basic was supplied by microsoft and its name is derived from the names of both apple and microsoft apple employees including randy wigginton adapted microsoft interpreter for the apple ii and added several features the first version of applesoft was released in on cassette tape and lacked proper support for high resolution graphics applesoft ii which was made available on cassette and disk and in the rom of the apple ii plus and subsequent models was released in it is this latter version which has some syntax differences and support for the apple ii high resolution graphics modes that is usually synonymous with the term applesoft an applesoft compiler tasc the applesoft compiler was released by microsoft in history when steve wozniak wrote integer basic for the apple ii he did not implement support for floating point math because he was primarily interested in writing games task for which integers alone were sufficient in microsoft had developed microsoft basic basic interpreter for the mos technology but at the time there was no production computer that used it upon learning that apple had machine microsoft asked if the company were interested in licensing basic but steve jobs replied that apple already had one the apple ii was unveiled to the public at the west coast computer faire in april and became available for sale in june one of the most common customer complaints about the computer was basic lack of floating point capability integer basic is limited to whole numbers between and and caused problems for users attempting to write business applications with it steve wozniak had never added floating point capabilities to integer basic as he did not consider them necessary for gaming and educational software the two primary tasks he envisioned for the apple ii as wozniak the only person who understood integer basic well enough to add floating point features was busy with the disk ii drive and controller and with apple dos apple turned to microsoft making things more problematic was that the rival commodore pet personal computer had floating point capable basic interpreter from the beginning the applesoft license also saved microsoft from near bankruptcy when they licensed basic to commodore for the pet in an agreement that proved unexpectedly costly for them apple reportedly obtained an eight year license for applesoft basic from microsoft for flat fee of renewing it in through an arrangement that gave microsoft the rights and source code for apple macintosh version of basic applesoft was designed to be backwards compatible with integer basic and uses the core of microsoft basic implementation which includes using the get command for detecting key presses and not requiring any spaces on program lines while applesoft basic is slower than integer basic it has many features that the older basic lacks atomic strings string is no longer an array of characters as in integer basic and it is instead garbage collected object as in scheme and java this allows for string arrays resulted in vector of eleven string variables numbered arrays numbers or strings single precision floating point variables with an bit exponent and bit significand and improved math capabilities including trigonometry and logarithmic functions commands for high resolution graphics data statements with read and restore commands for representing numerical and string values in quantity chr str and val functions for converting between string and numeric types both languages did have the asc function user defined functions simple one line functions written in basic with single parameter error trapping allowing basic programs to handle unexpected errors by means of subroutine written in basic conversely applesoft lacks the mod remainder operator that had been present in integer basic adapting basic for the apple ii was tedious job as apple received source listing for microsoft basic which proved to be buggy and also required the addition of integer basic commands since apple had no assembler on hand the development team was forced to send the source code over the phone lines to call computer an outfit that offered compiler services this was an extremely tedious slow process and after call computer lost the source code due to an equipment malfunction one of the programmers cliff huston used his own imsai computer to cross assemble the basic source features applesoft is similar to commodore basic aside from features inherited from integer basic there are few minor differences such as applesoft lack of bitwise operators otherwise most basic programs that do not use hardware dependent features will run on both basics the pr statement redirects output to an expansion card and in redirects input from an expansion card the slot number of the card is specified after the pr or in within the statement the computer locks up if there is no card present in the slot pr restores output to the column screen and in to the keyboard the pr statement can be used to redirect output to the printer where is the slot number containing the printer port card to send basic program listing to the printer the user types pr causes applesoft to boot the disk drives although the disk ii controller can be in any slot it is usually in slot pr switches to column text mode if an column card is present as with commodore basic numeric variables are stored as bit floating point each variable requires five bytes of memory the programmer may designate variables as integer by following them with percent sign in which case they use two bytes and are limited to range of to however basic internally converts
