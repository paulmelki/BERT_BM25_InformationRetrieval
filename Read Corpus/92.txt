albert einstein march april was german born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity one of the two pillars of modern physics alongside quantum mechanics his work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science he is best known to the general public for his mass energy equivalence formula which has been dubbed the world most famous equation he received the nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect pivotal step in the development of quantum theory the son of salesman who later operated an electrochemical factory einstein was born in the german empire but moved to switzerland in forsaking his german citizenship the following year specializing in physics and mathematics he received his academic teaching diploma from the swiss federal polytechnic school in zürich in the following year he acquired swiss citizenship which he kept for his entire life after initially struggling to find work from to he was employed as patent examiner at the swiss patent office in bern near the beginning of his career einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field this led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time as patent clerk in called his annus mirabilis miracle year he published four groundbreaking papers which attracted the attention of the academic world the first paper outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect the second explained brownian motion the third introduced special relativity and the fourth mass energy equivalence that year at the age of he was awarded phd by the university of zurich although initially treated with skepticism from many in the scientific community einstein works gradually came to be recognised as significant advancements he was invited to teach theoretical physics at the university of bern in and the following year moved to the university of zurich then in to charles university in prague before returning to eth the newly renamed federal polytechnic school in zürich in in he was elected to the prussian academy of sciences in berlin where he remained for years soon after publishing his work on special relativity einstein began working to extend the theory to gravitational fields he then published paper on general relativity in introducing his theory of gravitation he continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules he also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation the basis of the laser which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light in he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe in while einstein was visiting the united states adolf hitler came to power because of his jewish background einstein did not return to germany he settled in the united states and became an american citizen in on the eve of world war ii he endorsed letter to president franklin roosevelt alerting him to the potential german nuclear weapons program and recommending that the us begin similar research einstein supported the allies but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons einstein was affiliated with the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey until his death in he published more than scientific papers and more than non scientific works his intellectual achievements and originality have made the word einstein synonymous with genius eugene wigner compared him to his contemporaries writing that einstein understanding was deeper even than jancsi von neumann his mind was both more penetrating and more original than von neumann life and career early life and education einstein at the age of three in start of speech by albert einstein ladies coughs and gentlemen our age is proud of the progress it has made in man intellectual development the search and striving for truth and knowledge is one of the highest of man qualities united jewish appeal april radio universidad nacional de la plata argentina albert einstein was born in ulm in the kingdom of württemberg in the german empire on march his parents were hermann einstein salesman and engineer and pauline koch in the family moved to munich where einstein father and his uncle jakob founded fabrik einstein cie company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current the einsteins were non observant ashkenazi jews and albert attended catholic elementary school in munich from the age of five for three years at the age of eight he was transferred to the luitpold gymnasium now known as the albert einstein gymnasium where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the german empire seven years later in hermann and jakob company lost bid to supply the city of munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current dc standard to the more efficient alternating current ac standard the loss forced the sale of the munich factory in search of business the einstein family moved to italy first to milan and few months later to pavia when the family moved to pavia einstein then stayed in munich to finish his studies at the luitpold gymnasium his father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering but einstein clashed with the authorities and resented the school regimen and teaching method he later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning at the end of december he traveled to italy to join his family in pavia convincing the school to let him go by using doctor note during his time in italy he wrote short essay with the title on the investigation of the state of the ether in magnetic field einstein always excelled at math and physics from young age reaching mathematical level years ahead of his peers the year old einstein taught himself algebra and euclidean geometry over single summer einstein
