arguing that he should not have to pay any money then the plaintiff might file cross appeal arguing that the defendant should have to pay instead of the appellant is the party who having lost part or all their claim in lower court decision is appealing to higher court to have their case reconsidered this is usually done on the basis that the lower court judge erred in the application of law but it may also be possible to appeal on the basis of court misconduct or that finding of fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the evidence the appellant in the new case can be either the plaintiff or claimant defendant third party intervenor or respondent appellee from the lower case depending on who was the losing party the winning party from the lower court however is now the respondent in unusual cases the appellant can be the victor in the court below but still appeal an appellee is the party to an appeal in which the lower court judgment was in its favor the appellee is required to respond to the petition oral arguments and legal briefs of the appellant in general the appellee takes the procedural posture that the lower court decision should be affirmed ability to appeal an appeal as of right is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle the appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal an appeal by leave or permission requires the appellant to obtain leave to appeal in such situation either or both of the lower court and the court may have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellant demand to appeal the lower court decision in the supreme court review in most cases is available only if the court exercises its discretion and grants writ of certiorari in tort equity or other civil matters either party to previous case may file an appeal in criminal matters however the state or prosecution generally has no appeal as of right and due to the double jeopardy principle the state or prosecution may never appeal jury or bench verdict of acquittal but in some jurisdictions the state or prosecution may appeal as of right from trial court dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from trial court granting of defendant suppression motion likewise in some jurisdictions the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law by leave from the trial court or the appellate court the ability of the prosecution to appeal decision in favor of defendant varies significantly internationally all parties must present grounds to appeal or it will not be heard by convention in some law reports the appellant is named first this can mean that where it is the defendant who appeals the name of the case in the law reports reverses in some cases twice as the appeals work their way up the court hierarchy this is not always true however in the federal courts the parties names always stay in the same order as the lower court when an appeal is taken to the circuit courts of appeals and are re ordered only if the appeal reaches the supreme court direct or collateral appealing criminal convictions many jurisdictions recognize two types of appeals particularly in the criminal context the first is the traditional direct appeal in which the appellant files an appeal with the next higher court of review the second is the collateral appeal or post conviction petition in which the petitioner appellant files the appeal in court of first instance usually the court that tried the case the key distinguishing factor between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in state courts and the latter in federal courts relief in post conviction is rare and is most often found in capital or violent felony cases the typical scenario involves an incarcerated defendant locating dna evidence demonstrating the defendant actual innocence appellate review appellate review is the general term for the process by which courts with appellate jurisdiction take jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts it is distinguished from judicial review which refers to the court overriding constitutional or statutory right
