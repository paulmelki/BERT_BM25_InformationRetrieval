northern territory the labor party is the oldest political party in australia the alp was not founded as federal party until after the first sitting of the australian parliament in nevertheless it is regarded as descended from labour parties founded in the various australian colonies by the emerging labour movement in australia formally beginning in colonial labour parties contested seats from and federal seats following federation at the federal election the alp formed the world first labour party government as well as the world first social democratic government at national level at the federal election labor was the first party in australia to win majority in either house of the australian parliament at the federal and state colony level the australian labor party predates among

social democratic parties having previously been member of the socialist international name and spelling in standard australian english the word labour is spelled with however the political party uses the spelling labor without there was originally no standardised spelling of the party name with labor and labour both in common usage according to ross mcmullin who wrote an official history of the labor party the title page of the proceedings of federal conference used the spelling labor in labour in and and then labor from onwards in james catts put forward motion at federal conference that the name of the party be the australian labour party which was carried by votes to two separate motion recommending state branches to adopt the name was defeated there was no uniformity of party names until when federal conference resolved that state branches should adopt the name australian labor party now spelled without each state branch had previously used different name due to their different origins despite the alp officially adopting the spelling without it took decades for the official spelling to achieve widespread acceptance according to mcmullin the way the spelling of labor party was consolidated had more to do with the chap who ended up being in charge of printing the federal conference report than any other reason some sources have attributed the official choice of labor to influence from king malley who was born in the united states and was reputedly an advocate of spelling reform the spelling without is the standard form in american english it has been suggested that the adoption of the spelling without signified one of the alp earliest attempts at modernisation and served the purpose of differentiating the party from the australian labour movement as whole and distinguishing it from other british empire labour parties the decision to include the word australian in the party name rather than just labour party as in the united kingdom has been attributed to the greater importance of nationalism for the founders of the colonial parties history the australian labor party has its origins in the labour parties founded in the in the australian colonies prior
