actaeon aktaion in greek mythology son of the priestly herdsman aristaeus and autonoe in boeotia was famous theban hero like achilles in later generation he was trained by the centaur chiron he fell to the fatal wrath of artemis but the surviving details of his transgression vary the only certainty is in what aktaion suffered his pathos and what artemis did the hunter became the hunted he was transformed into stag and his raging hounds struck with wolf frenzy lyssa tore him apart as they would stag this is the iconic motif by which actaeon is recognized both in ancient art and in renaissance and post renaissance depictions the plot caserta left among others john heath has observed the unalterable kernel of the tale was hunter transformation into deer and his death in the jaws of his hunting dogs but authors were free to suggest different motives for his death in the version that was offered by the hellenistic poet callimachus which has become the standard setting artemis was bathing in the woods when the hunter actaeon stumbled across her thus seeing her naked he stopped and stared amazed at her ravishing beauty once seen artemis got revenge on actaeon she forbade him speech if he tried to speak he would be changed into stag for the unlucky profanation of her virginity mystery upon hearing the call of his hunting party he cried out to them and immediately transformed at this he fled deep into the woods and doing so he came upon pond and seeing his reflection groaned his own hounds then turned upon him and pursued him not recognizing him in an endeavour to save himself he raised his eyes and would have raised his arms had he had them toward mount olympus the gods did not heed his plea and he was torn to pieces an element of the earlier myth made actaeon the familiar hunting companion of artemis no stranger in an embroidered extension of the myth the hounds were so upset with their master death that chiron made statue so lifelike that the hounds thought it was actaeon there are various other versions of his transgression the hesiodic catalogue of women and pseudo apollodoran bibliotheke state that his offense was that he was rival of zeus for semele his mother sister whereas in euripides bacchae he has boasted that he is better hunter than artemis look at actaeon wretched fate who by the man eating hounds he had raised was torn apart better at hunting than artemis he had boasted to be in the meadows according to the latin version of the story told by the roman ovid having accidentally seen diana artemis on mount cithaeron while she was bathing he was changed by her into stag and pursued and killed by his fifty hounds this version also appears in callimachus fifth hymn as mythical parallel to the blinding of tiresias after he sees athena bathing the literary testimony of actaeon myth is largely lost but lamar ronald lacy deconstructing the myth elements in what survives and supplementing it by iconographic evidence in late vase painting made plausible reconstruction of an ancient actaeon myth that greek poets may have inherited and subjected to expansion and dismemberment his reconstruction opposes too pat consensus that has an archaic actaeon aspiring to semele classical actaeon boasting of his hunting prowess and hellenistic actaeon glimpsing artemis bath lacy identifies the site of actaeon transgression as spring sacred to artemis at plataea where actaeon was hero archegetes hero founder the righteous hunter the companion of artemis seeing her bathing naked in the spring was moved to try to make himself her consort as diodorus siculus noted and was punished in part for transgressing the hunter ritually enforced deference to artemis lacy names of dogs list of actaeon dogs dogs
