animation of the thermohaline circulation the later part of this animation shows the antarctic circumpolar current the antarctic circumpolar current acc is an ocean current that flows clockwise as seen from the south pole from west to east around antarctica an alternative name for the acc is the west wind drift the acc is the dominant circulation feature of the southern ocean and has mean transport estimated at sverdrups sv million mÂ³ or possibly even higher making it the largest ocean current the current is circumpolar due to the lack of any landmass connecting with antarctica and this keeps warm ocean waters away from antarctica enabling that continent to maintain its huge ice sheet associated with the circumpolar current is the antarctic convergence where the cold antarctic waters meet the warmer waters of the subantarctic creating zone of upwelling nutrients these nurture high levels of phytoplankton with associated copepods and krill and resultant foodchains supporting fish whales seals penguins albatrosses and wealth of other species the acc has been known to sailors for centuries it greatly speeds up any travel from west to east but makes sailing extremely difficult from east to west although this is mostly due to the prevailing westerly winds jack london story make westing and the circumstances preceding the mutiny on the bounty poignantly illustrate the difficulty it caused for mariners seeking to round cape horn westbound on the clipper ship route from new york to california the eastbound clipper route which is the fastest sailing route around the world follows the acc around three continental capes cape agulhas africa south east cape australia and cape horn south america the current creates the ross and weddell gyres structure the antarctic circumpolar current is the strongest current system in the world oceans and the only ocean current linking all major oceans the atlantic indian and pacific oceans seawater density fronts after the acc connects the atlantic pacific and indian oceans and serves as principal pathway of exchange among them the current is strongly constrained by landform and bathymetric features to trace it starting arbitrarily at south america it flows through the drake passage between south america and the antarctic peninsula and then is split by the scotia arc to the east with shallow warm branch flowing to the north in the falkland current and deeper branch passing through the arc more to the east before also turning to the north passing through the indian ocean the current first retroflects the agulhas current to form the agulhas return current before it is split by the kerguelen plateau and then moving northward again deflection is also seen as it passes over the mid ocean ridge in the southeast pacific fronts the current is accompanied by three fronts the subantarctic front saf the polar front pf and the southern acc front sacc furthermore the waters of the southern ocean are separated from the warmer and saltier subtropical waters by the subtropical front stf the northern boundary of the acc is defined by the northern edge of the saf this being the most northerly water to pass through drake passage and therefore be circumpolar much of the acc transport is carried in this front which is defined as the latitude at which subsurface salinity minimum or thick layer of unstratified subantarctic mode water first appears allowed by temperature dominating density stratification still further south lies the pf which is marked by transition to very cold relatively fresh antarctic surface water at the surface here temperature minimum is allowed by salinity dominating density stratification due to the lower temperatures farther south still is the sacc which is determined as the southernmost extent of circumpolar deep water temperature of about at this water mass flows along the shelfbreak of the western antarctic peninsula and thus marks the most southerly water flowing through drake passage and therefore circumpolar the bulk of the transport is carried in the middle two fronts the total transport of the acc at drake passage is estimated to be around sv or about times the transport of all the world rivers combined there is relatively small addition of flow in the indian ocean with the transport south of tasmania reaching around sv at which point the current is probably the largest on the planet dynamics the circumpolar current is driven by the strong westerly winds in the latitudes of the southern ocean in latitudes where there are continents winds blowing on light surface water can simply pile up light water against these continents but in the southern ocean the momentum imparted to the surface waters cannot be offset in this way there are different theories on how the circumpolar current balances the momentum imparted by the winds the increasing eastward momentum imparted by the winds causes water parcels to drift outward from the axis of the earth rotation in other words northward as result of the coriolis force this northward ekman transport is balanced by southward pressure driven flow below the depths of the major ridge systems some theories connect these flows directly implying that there is significant upwelling of dense deep waters within the southern ocean transformation of these waters into light surface waters and transformation of waters in the opposite direction to the north such theories link the magnitude of the circumpolar current with the global thermohaline circulation particularly the properties of the north atlantic alternatively ocean eddies the oceanic equivalent of atmospheric storms or the large scale meanders of the circumpolar current may directly transport momentum downward in the water column this is because such flows can produce net southward flow in the troughs and net northward flow over the ridges without requiring any transformation of density in practice both the thermohaline and the eddy meander mechanisms are likely to be important the current flows at rate of about over the macquarie ridge south of new zealand the acc varies with time evidence of this is the antarctic circumpolar wave periodic oscillation that affects the climate of
