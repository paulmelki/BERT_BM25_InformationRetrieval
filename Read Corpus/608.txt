andocides andokides bc was logographer speech writer in ancient greece he was one of the ten attic orators included in the alexandrian canon compiled by aristophanes of byzantium and aristarchus of samothrace in the third century bc life andocides was the son of leogoras and was born in athens around bc he belonged to the ancient eupatrid family of the kerykes who traced their lineage up to odysseus and the god hermes in andocides youth he seems to have been employed on various occasions as ambassador to thessaly macedonia molossia thesprotia italy and sicily and although he was frequently attacked for his political opinions he maintained his ground until in when he became involved in the charge brought against alcibiades for having profaned the mysteries and mutilated the herms on the eve of the departure of the athenian expedition against sicily it appeared particularly likely that andocides was an accomplice in the latter of these crimes which was believed to be preliminary step towards overthrowing the democratic constitution since the herm standing close to his house in the phyle aegeis was among the very few which had not been injured andocides was accordingly seized and thrown into prison but after some time recovered his freedom by promise that he would turn informer and reveal the names of the real perpetrators of the crime and on the suggestion of one charmides or timaeus he mentioned four all of whom were put to death he is said to have also denounced his own father on the charge of profaning the mysteries but to have rescued him again in the hour of danger charge he strenuously denied but as andocides was unable to clear himself from the charge he was deprived of his rights as citizen and left athens andocides traveled about in various parts of greece and was chiefly engaged in commercial enterprise and in forming connections with powerful people the means he employed to gain the friendship of powerful men were sometimes of the most disreputable kind among which service he rendered to prince in cyprus is mentioned in particular in andocides returned to athens on the establishment of the oligarchic government of the four hundred hoping that certain service he had rendered the athenian ships at samos would secure him welcome reception but no sooner were the oligarchs informed of the return of andocides than their leader peisander had him seized and accused him of having supported the party opposed to them at samos during his trial andocides who perceived the exasperation prevailing against him leaped to the altar which stood in the court and there assumed the attitude of supplicant this saved his life but he was imprisoned soon afterwards however he was set free or escaped from prison andocides then went to cyprus where for time he enjoyed the friendship of evagoras but by some circumstance or other he exasperated his friend and was consigned to prison here again he escaped and after the restoration of democracy in athens and the abolition of the four hundred he ventured once more to return to athens but as he was still suffering under sentence of civil he endeavored by means of bribes to persuade the prytaneis to allow him to attend the assembly of the people the latter however expelled him from the city it was on this occasion in that andocides delivered the speech still extant on his return on which he petitioned for permission to reside at athens but in vain in his third exile andocides went to reside in elis and during the time of his absence from his native city his house there was occupied by cleophon the leading demagogue andocides remained in exile until after the overthrow of the tyranny of the thirty by thrasybulus when the general amnesty then proclaimed made him hope that its benefit would be extended to him also he himself says that he returned to athens from cyprus where he claimed to have great influence and considerable property because of the general amnesty he was allowed to remain at athens enjoyed peace for the next three years and soon recovered an influential position according to lysias it was scarcely ten days after his return that he brought an accusation against archippus or aristippus which however he dropped on receiving sum of money during this period andocides became member of the boule in which he appears to have possessed great influence as well as in the popular assembly he was gymnasiarch at the hephaestaea was sent as architheorus to the isthmian games and olympic games and was even entrusted with the office of keeper of the sacred treasury but in callias supported by cephisius agyrrhius meletus and epichares urged the necessity of preventing andocides from attending the assembly as he had never been formally freed from the civil callias also charged him with violating the laws respecting the temple at eleusis the orator pleaded his case in the oration still extant on the mysteries περὶ τῶν μυστηρίων in which he argued that he had not been involved in the profanation of the mysteries or the mutilation of the herms that he had not violated the laws of the temple at eleusis that anyway he had received his citizenship back as result of the amnesty and that callias was really motivated by private dispute with andocides over inheritance he was acquitted after this he again enjoyed peace until he was sent as ambassador to sparta respecting the peace to be concluded in consequence of conon victory off cnidus on his return he was accused of illegal conduct during his embassy the speech on the peace with the lacedaemons περὶ τῆς πρὸς λακεδαιμονίους εἰρήνης which is still extant refers to this affair it was delivered in though some scholars place it in andocides was found guilty and sent into exile for the fourth time he never returned afterwards and seems to have died soon after this blow andocides appears to have fathered no
