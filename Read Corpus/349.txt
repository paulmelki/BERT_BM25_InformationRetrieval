in mathematics the term almost all means all but negligible amount more precisely if is set almost all elements of means all elements of but those in negligible subset of the meaning of negligible depends on the mathematical context for instance it can mean finite countable or null in contrast almost no means negligible amount that is almost no elements of means negligible amount of elements of meanings in different areas of mathematics prevalent meaning throughout mathematics almost all is sometimes used to mean all elements of an infinite set but finitely many this use occurs in philosophy as well similarly almost all can mean all elements of an uncountable set but countably many examples almost all positive integers are greater than almost all prime numbers are odd as is the only exception almost all polyhedra are irregular as there are only nine exceptions the five platonic solids and the four kepler poinsot polyhedra if is nonzero polynomial then for almost all if not all meaning in measure theory the cantor function as function that has zero derivative almost everywhere when speaking about the reals sometimes almost all can mean all reals but null set similarly if is some set of reals almost all numbers in can mean all numbers in but those in null set the real line can be thought of as one dimensional euclidean space in the more general case of an dimensional space where is positive integer these definitions can be generalised to all points but those in null set or all points in but those in null set this time is set of points in the space even more generally almost all is sometimes used in the sense of almost everywhere in measure theory or in the closely related sense of almost surely in probability theory examples in measure space such as the real line countable sets are null the set of rational numbers is countable and thus almost all real numbers are irrational as georg cantor proved in his first set theory article the set of algebraic numbers is countable as well so almost all reals are transcendental almost all reals are normal the cantor set is null as well thus almost all reals are not members of it even though it is uncountable the derivative of the cantor function is for almost all numbers in the unit interval it follows from the previous example because the cantor function is locally constant and thus has derivative outside the cantor set meaning in number theory in number theory almost all positive integers can mean the positive integers in set whose natural density is that is if is set of positive integers and if the proportion of positive integers in below out of all positive integers below tends to as tends to infinity then almost all positive integers are in more generally let be an infinite set of positive integers such as the set of even positive numbers or the set of primes if is subset of and if the proportion of elements of below that are in out of all elements of below tends to as tends to infinity then it can be said that almost all elements of are in examples the natural density of cofinite sets of positive integers is so each of them contains almost all positive integers almost all positive integers are composite almost all even positive numbers can be expressed as the sum of two primes almost all primes are isolated moreover for every positive integer almost all primes have prime gaps of more than both to their left and to their right that is there is no other primes between and meaning in graph theory in graph theory if is set of finite labelled graphs it can be said to contain almost all graphs if the proportion of graphs with vertices that are in tends to as tends to infinity however it is sometimes easier to work with probabilities so the definition is reformulated as follows the proportion of graphs with vertices that are in equals the probability that random graph with vertices chosen with the uniform distribution is in and choosing graph in this way has the same outcome as generating graph by flipping coin for each pair of vertices to decide whether to connect them therefore equivalently to the preceding definition the set contains almost all graphs if the probability that coin flip generated graph with vertices is in tends to as tends to infinity sometimes the latter definition is modified so that the graph is chosen randomly in some other way where not all graphs with vertices have the same probability and those modified definitions are not always equivalent to the main one the use of the term almost all in graph theory is not standard the term asymptotically almost surely is more commonly used for this concept example almost all graphs are asymmetric almost all graphs have diameter meaning in topology in topology and especially dynamical systems theory including applications in economics almost all of topological space points can mean all of the space points but those in meagre set some use more limited definition where subset only contains almost all of the space points if it contains some open dense set example given an irreducible algebraic variety the properties that hold for almost all points in the variety are exactly the generic properties this is due to the fact that in an irreducible algebraic variety equipped with the zariski topology all nonempty open sets are dense meaning in algebra in abstract algebra and mathematical logic if is an ultrafilter on set almost all elements of sometimes means the elements of some element of for any partition of into two disjoint sets one of them will necessarily contain almost all elements of it is possible to think of the elements of filter on as containing almost all elements of even if it isn an ultrafilter proofs see also almost everywhere
