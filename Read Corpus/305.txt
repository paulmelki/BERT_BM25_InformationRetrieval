the shapes of the first five atomic orbitals are and the two colors show the phase or sign of the wave function in each region each picture is domain coloring of function which depend on the coordinates of one electron to see the elongated shape of functions that show probability density more directly see pictures of orbitals below in atomic theory and quantum mechanics an atomic orbital is mathematical function describing the location and wave like behavior of an electron in an atom this function can be used to calculate the probability of finding any electron of an atom in any specific region around the atom nucleus the term atomic orbital may also refer to the physical region or space where the electron can be calculated to be present as predicted by the particular mathematical form of the orbital each orbital in an atom is characterized by unique set of values of the three quantum numbers and which respectively correspond to the electron energy angular momentum and an angular momentum vector component the magnetic quantum number each such orbital can be occupied by maximum of two electrons each with its own projection of spin the simple names orbital orbital orbital and orbital refer to orbitals with angular momentum quantum number and respectively these names together with the value of are used to describe the electron configurations of atoms they are derived from the description by early spectroscopists of certain series of alkali metal spectroscopic lines as harp rincipal iffuse and undamental orbitals for continue alphabetically omitting because some languages do not distinguish between the letters and atomic orbitals are the basic building blocks of the atomic orbital model alternatively known as the electron cloud or wave mechanics model modern framework for visualizing the submicroscopic behavior of electrons in matter in this model the electron cloud of multi electron atom may be seen as being built up in approximation in an electron configuration that is product of simpler hydrogen like atomic orbitals the repeating periodicity of the blocks of and elements within sections of the periodic table arises naturally from the total number of electrons that occupy complete set of and atomic orbitals respectively although for higher values of the quantum number particularly when the atom in question bears positive charge the energies of certain sub shells become very similar and so the order in which they are said to be populated by electrons cr ar and cr ar can only be rationalized somewhat arbitrarily atomic orbitals of the electron in hydrogen atom at different energy levels the probability of finding the electron is given by the color as shown in the key at upper right electron properties with the development of quantum mechanics and experimental findings such as the two slit diffraction of electrons it was found that the orbiting electrons around nucleus could not be fully described as particles but needed to be explained by the wave particle duality in this sense the electrons have the following properties wave like properties the electrons do not orbit the nucleus in the manner of planet orbiting the sun but instead exist as standing waves thus the lowest possible energy an electron can take is similar to the fundamental frequency of wave on string higher energy states are similar to harmonics of that fundamental frequency the electrons are never in single point location although the probability of interacting with the electron at single point can be found from the wave function of the electron the charge on the electron acts like it is smeared out in space in continuous distribution proportional at any point to the squared magnitude of the electron wave function particle like properties the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus can only be an integer electrons jump between orbitals like particles for example if single photon strikes the electrons only single electron changes states in response to the photon the electrons retain particle like properties such as each wave state has the same electrical charge as its electron particle each wave state has single discrete spin spin up or spin down depending on its superposition thus electrons cannot be described simply as solid particles an analogy might be that of large and often oddly shaped atmosphere the electron distributed around relatively tiny planet the atomic nucleus atomic orbitals exactly describe the shape of this atmosphere only when single electron is present in an atom when more electrons are added to single atom the additional electrons tend to more evenly fill in volume of space around the nucleus so that the resulting collection sometimes termed the atom electron cloud tends toward generally spherical zone of probability describing the electron location because of the uncertainty principle formal quantum mechanical definition atomic orbitals may be defined more precisely in formal quantum mechanical language they are an approximate solution to the schrodinger equation for the electrons bound to the atom by the electric field of the atom nucleus specifically in quantum mechanics the state of an atom an eigenstate of the atomic hamiltonian is approximated by an expansion see configuration interaction expansion and basis set into linear combinations of anti symmetrized products slater determinants of one electron functions the spatial components of these one electron functions are called atomic orbitals when one considers also their spin component one speaks of atomic spin orbitals state is actually function of the coordinates of all the electrons so that their motion is correlated but this is often approximated by this independent particle model of products of single electron wave functions the london dispersion force for example depends on the correlations of the motion of the electrons in atomic physics the atomic spectral lines correspond to transitions quantum leaps between quantum states of an atom these states are labeled by set of quantum numbers summarized in the term symbol and usually associated with particular electron configurations by occupation schemes of atomic orbitals for example for the ground state of neon term symbol this notation means that the
