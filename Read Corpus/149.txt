pyramids of giza are among the most recognizable symbols of the civilization of ancient egypt ancient egypt was civilization of ancient north africa concentrated along the lower reaches of the nile river situated in the place that is now the country egypt ancient egyptian civilization followed prehistoric egypt and coalesced around bc according to conventional egyptian chronology with the political unification of upper and lower egypt under menes often identified with narmer the history of ancient egypt occurred as series of stable kingdoms separated by periods of relative instability known as intermediate periods the old kingdom of the early bronze age the middle kingdom of the middle bronze age and the new kingdom of the late bronze age egypt reached the pinnacle of its power in the new kingdom ruling much of nubia and sizable portion of the near east after which it entered period of slow decline during the course of its history egypt was invaded or conquered by number of foreign powers including the hyksos the libyans the nubians the assyrians the achaemenid persians and the macedonians under the command of alexander the great the greek ptolemaic kingdom formed in the aftermath of alexander death ruled egypt until bc when under cleopatra it fell to the roman empire and became roman province the success of ancient egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the nile river valley for agriculture the predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops which supported more dense population and social development and culture with resources to spare the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions the early development of an independent writing system the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects trade with surrounding regions and military intended to assert egyptian dominance motivating and organizing these activities was bureaucracy of elite scribes religious leaders and administrators under the control of pharaoh who ensured the cooperation and unity of the egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs the many achievements of the ancient egyptians include the quarrying surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids temples and obelisks system of mathematics practical and effective system of medicine irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques the first known planked boats egyptian faience and glass technology new forms of literature and the earliest known peace treaty made with the hittites ancient egypt has left lasting legacy its art and architecture were widely copied and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for millennia newfound respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by europeans and egyptians led to the scientific investigation of egyptian civilization and greater appreciation of its cultural legacy history map of ancient egypt showing major cities and sites of the dynastic period bc to bc the nile has been the lifeline of its region for much of human history the fertile floodplain of the nile gave humans the opportunity to develop settled agricultural economy and more sophisticated centralized society that became cornerstone in the history of human civilization nomadic modern human hunter gatherers began living in the nile valley through the end of the middle pleistocene some years ago by the late paleolithic period the arid climate of northern africa became increasingly hot and dry forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region predynastic period typical naqada ii jar decorated with gazelles predynastic period in predynastic and early dynastic times the egyptian climate was much less arid than it is today large regions of egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates foliage and fauna were far more prolific in all environs and the nile region supported large populations of waterfowl hunting would have been common for egyptians and this is also the period when many animals were first domesticated by about bc small tribes living in the nile valley had developed into series of cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry and identifiable by their pottery and personal items such as combs bracelets and beads the largest of these early cultures in upper southern egypt was the badarian culture which probably originated in the western desert it was known for its high quality ceramics stone tools and its use of copper early tomb painting from nekhen bc naqada possibly gerzeh culture the badari was followed by the naqada culture the amratian naqada the gerzeh naqada ii and semainean naqada iii these brought number of technological improvements as early as the naqada period predynastic egyptians imported obsidian from ethiopia used to shape blades and other objects from flakes in naqada ii times early evidence exists of contact with the near east particularly canaan and the byblos coast over period of about years the naqada culture developed from few small farming communities into powerful civilization whose leaders were in complete control of the people and resources of the nile valley establishing power center at nekhen in greek hierakonpolis and later at abydos naqada iii leaders expanded their control of egypt northwards along the nile they also traded with nubia to the south the oases of the western desert to the west and the cultures of the eastern mediterranean and near east to the east initiating period of egypt mesopotamia relations the naqada culture manufactured diverse selection of material goods reflective of the increasing power and wealth of the elite as well as societal personal use items which included combs small statuary painted pottery high quality decorative stone vases cosmetic palettes and jewelry made of gold lapis and ivory they also developed ceramic glaze known as faience which was used well into the roman period to decorate cups amulets and figurines during the last predynastic phase the naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually were developed into full system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient egyptian
