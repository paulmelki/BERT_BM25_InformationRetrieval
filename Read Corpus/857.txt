concept design for the noah new orleans arcology habitat proposal designed by kevin schopfer buckminster fuller with drawing of his domed city proposal arcology portmanteau of architecture and ecology is field of creating architectural design principles for very densely populated ecologically low impact human habitats the term was coined in by architect paolo soleri who believed that completed arcology would provide space for variety of residential commercial and agricultural facilities while minimizing individual human environmental impact these structures have been largely hypothetical as no arcology even one envisioned by soleri himself has yet been built the concept has been popularized by various science fiction writers larry niven and jerry pournelle provided detailed description of an arcology in their novel oath of fealty william gibson mainstreamed the term in his seminal cyberpunk novel neuromancer where each corporation has its own self contained city known as arcologies more recently authors such as peter hamilton in neutronium alchemist and paolo bacigalupi in the water knife explicitly used arcologies as part of their scenarios they are often portrayed as self contained or economically self sufficient development an arcology is distinguished from merely large building in that it is designed to lessen the impact of human habitation on any given ecosystem it could be self sustainable employing all or most of its own available resources for comfortable life power climate control food production air and water conservation and purification sewage treatment etc an arcology is designed to make it possible to supply those items for large population an arcology would supply and maintain its own municipal or urban infrastructures in order to operate and connect with other urban environments apart from its own arcology was proposed to reduce human impact on natural resources arcology designs might apply conventional building and civil engineering techniques in very large but practical projects in order to achieve pedestrian economies of scale that have proven post automobile to be difficult to achieve in other ways frank lloyd wright proposed an early version called broadacre city although in contrast to an arcology wright idea is comparatively two dimensional and depends on road network wright plan described transportation agriculture and commerce systems that would support an economy critics said that wright solution failed to account for population growth and assumed more rigid democracy than the actually has buckminster fuller proposed the old man river city project domed city with capacity of as solution to the housing problems in east st louis illinois paolo soleri proposed later solutions and coined the term arcology soleri describes ways of compacting city structures in three dimensions to combat two dimensional urban sprawl to economize on transportation and other energy uses like wright soleri proposed changes in transportation agriculture and commerce soleri explored reductions in resource consumption and duplication land reclamation he also proposed to eliminate most private transportation he advocated for greater frugality and favored greater use of shared social resources including public transit and public libraries arcosanti city similar real world projects arcosanti is an experimental arcology prototype demonstration project under construction in central arizona since designed by paolo soleri its primary purpose is to demonstrate soleri personal designs his application of principles of arcology to create pedestrian friendly urban form many cities in the world have proposed projects adhering to the design principles of the arcology concept like tokyo and dongtan near shanghai the dongtan project may have collapsed and it failed to open for the shanghai world expo in mcmurdo station begich towers mcmurdo station of the united states antarctic program and other scientific research stations on antarctica resemble the popular conception of an arcology as technologically advanced relatively self sufficient human community the antarctic research base provides living and entertainment amenities for roughly staff who visit each year its remoteness and the measures needed to protect its population from the harsh environment give it an insular character the station is not self sufficientthe military delivers cubic metres us gal of fuel and of supplies and equipment yearly through its operation deep freeze resupply effortbut it is isolated from conventional support networks under international treaty it must avoid damage to the surrounding ecosystem begich towers operates like small scale arcology encompassing nearly all of the population of whittier alaska the building contains residential housing as well as police station grocery and municipal offices whittier once boasted second structure known as the buckner building the buckner building still stands but was deemed unfit for habitation after the earthquake in popular culture most proposals to build real arcologies have failed due to financial structural or conceptual shortcomings arcologies are therefore found primarily in fictional works one of the earliest examples in literature is william hope hodgson horror fantasy novel the night land where the last remnants of humanity survive in two enormous self contained metal pyramids another significant example is the novel oath of fealty by larry niven and jerry pournelle in which segment of the population of los angeles has moved into an arcology the plot examines the social changes that result both inside and outside the arcology thus the arcology is not just plot device but subject of critique in robert silverberg the world inside most of the global population of billion live inside giant skyscrapers called urbmons each of which contains hundreds of thousands of people the urbmons are arranged in constellations each urbmon is divided into neighborhoods of or so floors all the needs of the inhabitants are provided inside the building food is grown outside and brought into the building so the idea of going outside is heretical and can be sign of madness the book examines human life when the population density is extremely high in the larry niven novel the california voodoo game role playing participants are engaged in live gaming contest in an abandoned arcology on the west coast of the united states the maxis computer games simcity and simcity both allow the construction of arcologies in the future
