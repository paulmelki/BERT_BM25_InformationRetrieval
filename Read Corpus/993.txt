abacá binomial name musa textilis is species of banana native to the philippines grown as commercial crop in the philippines ecuador and costa rica the plant also known as manila hemp has great economic importance being harvested for its fiber also called manila hemp extracted from the leaf stems abacá is also the traditional source of lustrous fiber hand loomed into various indigenous textiles in the philippines like nalak as well as colonial era sheer luxury fabrics known as nipis they are also the source of fibers for sinamay loosely woven stiff material used for textiles as well as in traditional philippine millinery the plant grows to and averages about the fiber was originally used for making twines and ropes now most is pulped and used in variety of specialized paper products including tea bags filter paper and banknotes it is classified as hard fiber along with coir henequin and sisal description the abacá plant is stoloniferous meaning that the plant produces runners or shoots along the ground that then root at each segment cutting and transplanting rooted runners is the primary technique for creating new plants since seed growth is substantially slower abacá has false trunk or pseudostem about in diameter the leaf stalks petioles are expanded at the base to form sheaths that are tightly wrapped together to form the pseudostem there are from to leaves dark green on the top and pale green on the underside sometimes with large brown patches they are oblong in shape with deltoid base they grow in succession the petioles grow to at least in length when the plant is mature the flower stalk grows up inside the pseudostem the male flower has five petals each about long the leaf sheaths contain the valuable fiber after harvesting the coarse fibers range in length from long they are composed primarily of cellulose lignin and pectin the fruit which is inedible and is rarely seen as harvesting occurs before the plant fruits grows to about in length and in diameter it has black turbinate seeds that are in diameter systematics the abacá plant belongs to the banana family musaceae it resembles the closely related wild seeded bananas musa acuminata and musa balbisiana its scientific name is musa textilis within the genus musa it is placed in section callimusa now including the former section australimusa members of which have diploid chromosome number of history abacá fiber drying in abaca farm costa rica abacá fiber in lagonoy camarines sur philippines before synthetic textiles came into use textilis was major source of high quality fiber soft silky and fine ancestors of the modern abacá are thought to have originated from the eastern philippines where there is significant rainfall throughout the year wild varieties of abacá can still be found in the interior forests of catanduanes island away from cultivated areas today catanduanes has many other modern kinds of abacá which are more competitive for many years breeders from various research institutions have made the cultivated varieties of catanduanes island even more competitive in local and international markets this results in the optimum production of the island which had consistent highest production throughout the archipelago europeans first came into contact with abacá fibre when magellan made land in the philippines in as the natives were cultivating it and utilizing it in bulk for textiles already throughout the spanish colonial era it was referred to as medriñaque cloth by the philippines were exporting almost tons of abacá and it was one of the three biggest cash crops along with tobacco and sugar in fact from through the end of the th century sugar or abacá alternated with each other as the biggest export crop of the philippines this th century trade was predominantly with the united states and the making of ropes was done mainly in new england although in time the rope making was moved back to the philippines excluding the philippines abacá was first cultivated on large scale in sumatra in under the dutch who had observed its cultivation in the philippines for cordage since the nineteenth century followed up by plantings in central america in sponsored by the department of agriculture it also was transplanted into india and guam commercial planting began in in british north borneo with the commencement of world war ii the supply from the philippines was eliminated by the japanese in the early train running from danao to argao would transport philippine abacá from the plantations to cebu city for export the train and tracks were destroyed during the second world war however the abaca plantations continue and are now transported to cebu by road after the war the department of agriculture started production in panama costa rica honduras and guatemala today abacá is produced primarily in the philippines and ecuador the philippines produces between and of the world abacá and the production employs million people production has declined because of virus diseases uses mats made from woven abacá fibers from the philippines due to its strength it is sought after product and is the strongest of the natural fibers it is used by the paper industry for such specialty uses such as tea bags banknotes and decorative papers it can be used to make handcrafts such as hats bags carpets clothing and furniture abacá rope is very durable flexible and resistant to salt water damage allowing its use in hawsers ship lines and fishing nets rope can require to break abacá fiber was once used primarily for rope but this application is now of minor significance lupis is the finest quality of abacá sinamay is woven chiefly from abacá textiles the traditional nalak cloth of the boli dreamweavers are made from abacá fibers boli dreamweaver using traditional loom the inner fibers are used in the making of hats including the manila hats hammocks matting cordage ropes coarse twines and types of canvas abacá cloth is found in museum collections around the world like the boston museum of fine arts and the
