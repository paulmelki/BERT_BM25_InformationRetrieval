ptolemy the geographer and astronomer from alexandria who drafted map in ad which shows the city of albanopolis located northeast of durrës the term may have continuation in the name of medieval

the discovered objects in cave near xarrë include flint and jasper objects along with fossilised animal bones while those discoveries at mount dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the aurignacian culture they also demonstrate notable similarities with objects of the equivalent period found at crvena stijena in montenegro and northwestern greece multiple artifacts from the iron and bronze ages near tumulus burials have been unearthed in central and southern albania which has similar affinity with the sites in southwestern macedonia and lefkada archaeologists have come to the conclusion that these regions were inhabited from the middle of the third millennium bc by indo european people who spoke proto greek language hence part of this historical population later moved to mycenae around bc and properly established the mycenaean civilisation antiquity founded in the th century bc scodra was an significant city of the illyrian tribes of the ardiaei and labeates in ancient times the incorporated territory of albania was historically inhabited by indo european peoples among them numerous illyrian tribes ancient greeks and thracians in view of the illyrian tribes there is no evidence that these tribes used any collective nomenclature for themselves while it is regarded to be unlikely that they used common endonym the endonym illyrians seems to be the name applied to specific illyrian tribe which was the first to come in liaison with the ancient greeks resulting the endonym illyrians to be applied pars pro toto to all people of similar language and customs apollonia was an important ancient greek colony on the illyrian coast along the adriatic sea and one of the western points of the via egnatia route that connected rome and constantinople the territory referred to as illyria corresponded roughly to the area east of the adriatic sea in the mediterranean sea extending in the south to the mouth of the vjosë the first account of the illyrian groups comes from periplus of the euxine sea an ancient greek text written in the middle of the th century bc
