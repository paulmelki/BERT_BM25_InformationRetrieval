master thesis richard evans schultes allowed claudio naranjo to make special journey by canoe up the amazon river to study ayahuasca with the south american indians he brought back samples of the beverage and published the first scientific description of the effects of its active alkaloids in brazil number of modern religious movements based on the use of ayahuasca have emerged the most famous being santo daime and the união do vegetal or udv usually in an animistic context that may be shamanistic or more often as with santo daime and the udv integrated with christianity both santo daime

preparation sections of banisteriopsis caapi vine are macerated and boiled alone or with leaves from any of number of other plants including psychotria viridis chacruna diplopterys cabrerana also known as chaliponga and chacropanga and mimosa tenuiflora among other ingredients which can vary greatly from one shaman to the next the resulting brew may contain the powerful psychedelic drug dmt and mao inhibiting harmala alkaloids which are necessary to make the dmt orally active the traditional making of ayahuasca follows ritual process that requires the user to pick the lower chacruna leaf at sunrise then say prayer the vine must be cleaned meticulously with wooden spoons and pounded with wooden mallets until it fibre brews can also be made with plants that do not contain dmt psychotria viridis being replaced by plants such as justicia pectoralis brugmansia or sacred tobacco also known as mapacho nicotiana rustica or sometimes left out with no replacement this brew varies radically from one batch to the next both in potency and psychoactive effect based mainly on the skill of the shaman or brewer as well as other admixtures sometimes added and the intent of the ceremony natural variations in plant alkaloid content and profiles also affect the final concentration of alkaloids in the brew and the physical act of cooking may also serve to modify the alkaloid profile of harmala alkaloids the actual preparation of the brew takes several hours often taking place over the course of more than one day after adding the
