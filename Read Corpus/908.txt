the actinoid iupac nomenclature also called actinide series encompasses the metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers from to actinium through lawrencium the actinoid series derives its name from the first element in the series actinium the informal chemical symbol an is used in general discussions of actinoid chemistry to refer to any actinoid strictly speaking actinium has been labeled as group element but is often included in any general discussion of the chemistry of the actinoid elements since actinoid means actinium like cf humanoid or android it has been argued due semantic reasons that actinium cannot logically be an actinoid but iupac acknowledges its inclusion based on common usage all but one of the actinides are block elements with the exception being either actinium or lawrencium the series mostly corresponds to the filling of the electron shell although actinium and thorium lack any electrons and curium and lawrencium have the same number as the preceding element in comparison with the lanthanides also mostly block elements the actinides show much more variable valence they all have very large atomic and ionic radii and exhibit an unusually large range of physical properties while actinium and the late actinides from americium onwards behave similarly to the lanthanides the elements thorium protactinium and uranium are much more similar to transition metals in their chemistry with neptunium and plutonium occupying an intermediate position all actinides are radioactive and release energy upon radioactive decay naturally occurring uranium and thorium and synthetically produced plutonium are the most abundant actinides on earth these are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses and americium is used in the ionization chambers of most modern smoke detectors of the actinides primordial thorium and uranium occur naturally in substantial quantities the radioactive decay of uranium produces transient amounts of actinium and protactinium and atoms of neptunium and plutonium are occasionally produced from transmutation reactions in uranium ores the other actinides are purely synthetic elements nuclear weapons tests have released at least six actinides heavier than plutonium into the environment analysis of debris from hydrogen bomb explosion

elements which follow uranium in the periodic table and transplutonium elements which follow plutonium compared to the lanthanides which except for promethium are found in nature in appreciable quantities most actinides are rare the majority of them do not even occur in nature and of those that do only thorium and uranium do so in more than trace quantities the most abundant or easily synthesized actinides are uranium and thorium followed by plutonium americium actinium protactinium neptunium and curium the existence of transuranium elements was suggested by enrico fermi based on his experiments in however even though four actinides were known by that time it was not yet understood that they formed family similar to lanthanides the prevailing view that dominated early research into transuranics was that they were regular elements in the th period with thorium protactinium and uranium corresponding to th period hafnium tantalum and tungsten respectively synthesis of transuranics gradually undermined this point of view by an observation that curium failed to exhibit oxidation states above whereas its supposed th period homolog platinum can reach oxidation state of prompted glenn seaborg to formulate an actinide hypothesis studies of known actinides and discoveries of further transuranic elements provided more data in support of this point of view but the phrase actinide hypothesis the implication being that hypothesis is something that has not been decisively proven remained in active use by scientists through the late at present there are two major methods of producing isotopes of transplutonium elements irradiation of the lighter elements with either neutrons or accelerated charged particles the first method is most important for applications as only neutron irradiation using nuclear reactors allows the production of sizeable amounts of synthetic actinides however it is limited to relatively light elements the advantage of the second method is that elements heavier than plutonium as well as neutron deficient isotopes can be obtained which are not formed during neutron irradiation in there were attempts in the united states to produce transplutonium isotopes using series of six underground nuclear explosions small samples of rock were extracted from the blast area immediately after the test to study the explosion products but no isotopes with mass number greater than could be detected despite predictions that such isotopes would have relatively long half lives of decay this non observation was attributed to spontaneous fission owing to the large speed of the products and to other decay channels such as neutron emission and nuclear fission from actinium to uranium enrico fermi suggested the existence of transuranium elements in uranium and thorium were the first actinides discovered uranium was identified in by the german chemist martin heinrich klaproth in
