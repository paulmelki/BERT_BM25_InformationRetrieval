nine banded armadillo skeleton three banded armadillo skeleton on display at the museum of osteology armadillos meaning little armoured ones in spanish are new world placental mammals in the order cingulata the chlamyphoridae and dasypodidae are the only surviving families in the order which is part of the superorder xenarthra along with the anteaters and sloths nine extinct genera and extant species of armadillo have been described some of which are distinguished by the number of bands on their armour all species are native to the americas where they inhabit variety of different environments armadillos are characterized by leathery armour shell and long sharp claws for digging they have short legs but can move quite quickly the average length of an armadillo is about including tail the giant armadillo grows up to and weighs up to while the pink fairy armadillo has length of only when threatened by predator tolypeutes species frequently roll up into ball these being the only species of armadillo capable of such etymology the word armadillo means little armoured one in spanish the aztecs called them āyōtōchtli nahuatl for turtle rabbit āyōtl turtle and tōchtli rabbit the portuguese word for armadillo is tatu which is derived from the tupi language similar names are also found in other especially european languages classification pink fairy armadillo

recent simplified phylogeny of the xenarthran families which includes armadillos based on slater et al and delsuc et al the dagger symbol denotes extinct groups evolution recent genetic research suggests that an extinct group of giant armoured mammals the glyptodonts should be included within the lineage of armadillos having diverged some million years ago more recently than previously assumed distribution like all of the xenarthra lineages armadillos originated in south america due to the continent former isolation they were confined there for most of the cenozoic the recent formation of the isthmus of panama allowed few members of the family to migrate northward into southern north america by the early pleistocene as part of the great american interchange some of their much larger cingulate relatives the pampatheres and chlamyphorid glyptodonts made the same journey today all extant armadillo species are still present in south america they are particularly diverse in paraguay where species exist and surrounding areas many species are endangered some including four species of dasypus are widely distributed over the americas whereas others such as yepes mulita are restricted to small ranges two species the northern naked tailed armadillo and nine banded armadillo are found in central america the latter has also reached the united states primarily in the south central states notably texas but with range that extends as far east as north carolina and florida and as far north as southern nebraska and southern indiana their range has consistently expanded in north america over the last century due to lack of natural predators characteristics size armadillos are small to medium sized mammals the smallest species the pink fairy armadillo is roughly chipmunk sized at and in total length the largest species the giant armadillo can reach the size of small pig and weigh up to and can be long diet and predation they are prolific diggers many species use their sharp claws to dig for food such as grubs and to dig dens the nine banded armadillo prefers to build burrows in moist soil near the creeks streams and arroyos around which it lives and feeds the diets of different armadillo species vary but consist mainly of insects grubs and other invertebrates some species however feed almost entirely on ants and termites paws of hairy and giant armadillo armadillos have very poor eyesight and use their keen sense of smell to hunt for food they use their claws for digging and finding food as well as for making their homes in burrows they dig their burrows with their claws making only single corridor the width of the animal body they have five clawed toes on their hind feet and three to five toes with heavy digging claws on their fore feet armadillos have numerous cheek teeth which are not divided into premolars and molars but usually have no incisors or canines the dentition of the nine banded armadillo is body temperature in common with other xenarthrans armadillos in general have low body temperatures of and low basal metabolic rates of that expected in placental mammals of their mass this is particularly true of types that specialize in using termites as their primary food source for example priodontes and tolypeutes skin the armour is formed by plates of dermal bone covered in relatively small overlapping epidermal scales called scutes composed of bone with covering of horn most species have rigid shields over the shoulders and hips with number of bands separated by flexible skin covering the back and flanks additional armour covers the top of the head the upper parts of the limbs and the
