an axon from greek ἄξων áxōn axis or nerve fiber or nerve fibre see spelling differences is long slender projection of nerve cell or neuron in vertebrates that typically conducts electrical impulses known as action potentials away from the nerve cell body the function of the axon is to transmit information to different neurons muscles and glands in certain sensory neurons pseudounipolar neurons such as those for touch and warmth the axons are called afferent nerve fibers and the electrical impulse travels along these from the periphery to the cell body and from the cell body to the spinal cord along another branch of the same axon axon dysfunction has caused many inherited and acquired neurological disorders which can affect both the peripheral and central neurons nerve fibers are classed into three types group nerve fibers group nerve fibers and group nerve fibers groups and are myelinated and group are unmyelinated these groups include both sensory fibers and motor fibers another classification groups only the sensory fibers as type type ii type iii and type iv an axon is one of two types of cytoplasmic protrusions from the cell body of neuron the other type is dendrite axons are distinguished from dendrites by several features including shape dendrites often taper while axons usually maintain constant radius length dendrites are restricted to small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer and function dendrites receive signals whereas axons transmit them some types of neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites in some species axons can emanate from dendrites known as axon carrying dendrites no neuron ever has more than one axon however in invertebrates such as insects or leeches the axon sometimes consists of several regions that function more or less independently of each other axons are covered by membrane known as an axolemma the cytoplasm of an axon is called axoplasm most axons branch in some cases very profusely the end branches of an axon are called telodendria the swollen end of telodendron is known as the axon terminal which joins the dendron or cell body of another neuron forming synaptic connection axons make contact with other cells usually other neurons but sometimes muscle or gland cells at junctions called synapses in some circumstances the axon of one neuron may form synapse with the dendrites of the same neuron resulting in an autapse at synapse the membrane of the axon closely adjoins the membrane of the target cell and special molecular structures serve to transmit electrical or electrochemical signals across the gap some synaptic junctions appear along the length of an axon as it extends these are called en passant in passing synapses and can be in the hundreds or even the thousands along one axon other synapses appear as terminals at the ends of axonal branches single axon with all its branches taken together can innervate multiple parts of the brain and generate thousands of synaptic terminals bundle of axons make nerve tract in the central nervous system and fascicle in the peripheral nervous system in placental mammals the largest white matter tract in the brain is the corpus callosum formed of some million axons in the human brain anatomy typical myelinated axon dissected human brain showing grey matter and white matter axons are the primary transmission lines of the nervous system and as bundles they form nerves some axons can extend up to one meter or more while others extend as little as one millimeter the longest axons in the human body are those of the sciatic nerve which run from the base of the spinal cord to the big toe of each foot the diameter of axons is also variable most individual axons are microscopic in diameter typically about one micrometer µm across the largest mammalian axons can reach diameter of up to µm the squid giant axon which is specialized to conduct signals very rapidly is close to millimetre in diameter the size of small pencil lead the numbers of axonal telodendria the branching structures at the end of the axon can also differ from one nerve fiber to the next axons in the central nervous system cns typically show multiple telodendria with many synaptic end points in comparison the cerebellar granule cell axon is characterized by single shaped branch node from which two parallel fibers extend elaborate branching allows for the simultaneous transmission of messages to large number of target neurons within single region of the brain there are two types of axons in the nervous system myelinated and unmyelinated axons myelin is layer of fatty insulating substance which is formed by two types of glial cells schwann cells and in the peripheral nervous system schwann cells form the myelin sheath of myelinated axon in the central nervous system form the insulating myelin along myelinated nerve fibers gaps in the myelin sheath known as nodes of ranvier occur at evenly spaced intervals the myelination enables an especially rapid mode of electrical impulse propagation called saltatory conduction the myelinated axons from the cortical neurons form the bulk of the neural tissue called white matter in the brain the myelin gives the white appearance to the tissue in contrast to the grey matter of the cerebral cortex which contains the neuronal cell bodies similar arrangement is seen in the cerebellum bundles of myelinated axons make up the nerve tracts in the cns where these tracts cross the midline of the brain to connect opposite regions they are called commissures the largest of these is the corpus callosum that connects the two cerebral hemispheres and this has around million axons the structure of neuron is seen to consist of two separate functional regions or compartments the cell body together with the dendrites as one region and the axonal region as the other axonal region the axonal region or compartment includes the axon hillock the initial segment the rest of the axon and the axon telodendria and axon terminals it also includes the
