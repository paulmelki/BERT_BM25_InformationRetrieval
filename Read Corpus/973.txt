page from the bombardier information file bif that describes the components and controls of the norden bombsight the norden bombsight was highly sophisticated optical mechanical analog computer used by the united states army air force during world war ii the korean war and the vietnam war to aid the pilot of bomber aircraft in dropping bombs accurately alt px px an analog computer or analogue computer is type of computer that uses the continuously changeable aspects of physical phenomena such as electrical mechanical or hydraulic quantities to model the problem being solved in contrast digital computers represent varying quantities symbolically and by discrete values of both time and amplitude analog computers can have very wide range of complexity slide rules and nomograms are the simplest while naval gunfire control computers and large hybrid digital analog computers were among the most complicated systems for process control and protective relays used analog computation to perform control and protective functions analog computers were widely used in scientific and industrial applications even after the advent of digital computers because at the time they were typically much faster but they started to become obsolete as early as the and although they remained in use in some specific applications such as aircraft flight simulators the flight computer in aircraft and for teaching control systems in universities more complex applications such as aircraft flight simulators and synthetic aperture radar remained the domain of analog computing and hybrid computing well into the since digital computers were insufficient for the task timeline of analog computers precursors this is list of examples of early computation devices considered precursors of the modern computers some of them may even have been dubbed computers by the press though they may fail to fit modern definitions the px the antikythera mechanism was an orrery and is considered an early mechanical analog computer according to derek de solla price it was designed to calculate astronomical positions it was discovered in in the antikythera wreck off the greek island of antikythera between kythera and crete and has been dated to during the hellenistic period of greece devices of level of complexity comparable to that of the antikythera mechanism would not reappear until thousand years later many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use the planisphere was first described by ptolemy in the nd century ad the astrolabe was invented in the hellenistic world in either the st or nd centuries bc and is often attributed to hipparchus combination of the planisphere and dioptra the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy an astrolabe incorporating mechanical calendar computer and gear wheels was invented by abi bakr of isfahan persia in abū rayhān al bīrūnī invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe an early fixed wired knowledge processing machine with gear train and gear wheels the castle clock hydropowered mechanical astronomical clock invented by al jazari in was the first programmable analog computer the sector calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion trigonometry multiplication and division and for various functions such as squares and cube roots was developed in the late th century and found application in gunnery surveying and navigation the planimeter was manual instrument to calculate the area of closed figure by tracing over it with mechanical linkage px the slide rule was invented around shortly after the publication of the concept of the logarithm it is hand operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division as slide rule development progressed added scales provided reciprocals squares and square roots cubes and cube roots as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions aviation is one of the few fields where slide rules are still in widespread use particularly for solving time distance problems in light aircraft in mathematician and engineer giovanni plana devised perpetual calendar machine which through system of pulleys and cylinders could predict the perpetual calendar for every year from ad that is bc to ad keeping track of leap years and varying day length the tide predicting machine invented by sir william thomson in was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters it used system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for set period at particular location the differential analyser mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration used wheel and disc mechanisms to perform the integration in james thomson had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ball and disk integrators in differential analyzer the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator or graphing output the torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work starting in the vannevar bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers modern era analog computing machine at the px px the dumaresq was mechanical calculating device invented around by lieutenant john dumaresq of the royal navy it was an analog computer that related vital variables of the fire control problem to the movement of one own ship and that of target ship it was often used with other devices such as vickers range clock to generate range and deflection data so the gun sights of the ship could be continuously set number of versions of the dumaresq were produced of increasing complexity as development proceeded by arthur pollen had developed an electrically driven mechanical analog computer for fire control systems based on the differential analyser it was used by the imperial russian navy in world war starting in ac network analyzers were constructed to solve calculation problems related to electrical power systems that were too large to solve with numerical methods at the time these were essentially scale models of the electrical properties of the full size system since network analyzers could handle problems too large for analytic methods or hand computation they were
