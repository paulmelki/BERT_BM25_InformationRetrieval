artificial intelligence ai is intelligence demonstrated by machines unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals leading ai textbooks define the field as the study of intelligent agents any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals colloquially the term artificial intelligence is often used to describe machines or computers that mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with the human mind such as learning and problem solving as machines become increasingly capable tasks considered to require intelligence are often removed from the definition of ai phenomenon known as the ai effect quip in tesler theorem says ai is whatever hasn been done yet for instance optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be ai having become routine technology modern machine capabilities generally classified as ai include successfully understanding human speech competing at the highest level in strategic game systems such as chess and go autonomously operating cars intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism followed by disappointment and the loss of funding known as an ai winter followed by new approaches success and renewed funding after alphago successfully defeated professional go player in artificial intelligence once again attracted widespread global attention for most of its history ai research has been divided into sub fields that often fail to communicate with each other these sub fields are based on technical considerations such as particular goals robotics or machine learning the use of particular tools logic or artificial neural networks or deep philosophical differences sub fields have also been based on social factors particular institutions or the work of particular researchers the traditional problems or goals of ai research include reasoning knowledge representation planning learning natural language processing perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects general intelligence is among the field long term goals approaches include statistical methods computational intelligence and traditional symbolic ai many tools are used in ai including versions of search and mathematical optimization artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics probability and economics the ai field draws upon computer science information engineering mathematics psychology linguistics philosophy and many other fields the field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence can be so precisely described that machine can be made to simulate it this raises philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human like intelligence these issues have been explored by myth fiction and philosophy since antiquity some people also consider ai to be danger to humanity if it progresses unabated others believe that ai unlike previous technological revolutions will create risk of mass unemployment in the twenty first century ai techniques have experienced resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power large amounts of data and theoretical understanding and ai techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science software engineering and operations research history silver didrachma from crete depicting talos an ancient mythical automaton with artificial intelligence thought capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity and have been common in fiction as in mary shelley frankenstein or karel ƒçapek these characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence the study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity the study of mathematical logic led directly to alan turing theory of computation which suggested that machine by shuffling symbols as simple as and could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction this insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the church turing thesis along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology information theory and cybernetics this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain turing proposed changing the question from whether machine was intelligent to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour the first work that is now generally recognized as ai was mccullouch and pitts formal design for turing complete artificial neurons the field of ai research was born at workshop at dartmouth college in where the term artificial intelligence was coined by john mccarthy to distinguish the field from cybernetics and escape the influence of the cyberneticist norbert wiener attendees allen newell cmu herbert simon cmu john mccarthy mit marvin minsky mit and arthur samuel ibm became the founders and leaders of ai research they and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing computers were learning checkers strategies and by were reportedly playing better than the average human solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems logic theorist first run and speaking english by the middle of the research in the was heavily funded by the department of defense and laboratories had been established around the world ai founders were optimistic about the future herbert simon predicted machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work man can do marvin minsky agreed writing within generation the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved they failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks progress slowed and in in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill and ongoing pressure from the us congress to fund more productive projects both the and british governments cut off exploratory research in ai the next few years would later be called an ai winter period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficult in the early ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts by the market for ai had reached over billion dollars at the same time japan fifth generation computer project inspired the and british governments to restore funding for academic research however beginning with the collapse of
