an apple ii computer with an external modem the apple ii stylized as apple is an bit home computer and one of the world first highly successful mass produced microcomputer products it was designed primarily by steve wozniak steve jobs oversaw the development of the apple ii foam molded plastic case and rod holt developed the switching power supply it was introduced by jobs and wozniak at the west coast computer faire and marks apple first launch of personal computer aimed at consumer market branded toward american households rather than businessmen or computer hobbyists the three computers that byte magazine referred to as the trinity of home computing the commodore pet the apple ii and the trs model byte magazine referred to the apple ii commodore pet and the trs as the trinity the apple ii had the defining feature of being able to display color graphics and this was why the apple logo was redesigned to have spectrum of colors the apple ii is the first model in the apple ii series followed by the apple ii apple iie apple iic and the bit apple iigs all of which remained compatible production of the last available model the apple iie ceased in november history by steve jobs had convinced the product designer jerry manock who had formerly worked at hewlett packard designing calculators to create the shell for the apple ii smooth case inspired by kitchen appliances that concealed the internal mechanics the earliest apple ii were assembled in silicon valley and later in texas printed circuit boards were manufactured in ireland and singapore the first computers went on sale on june with mos technology microprocessor running at mhz of the ntsc color carrier two game paddles bundled until when they were found to violate fcc regulations kib of ram an audio cassette interface for loading programs and storing data and the integer basic programming language built into the roms the video controller displayed lines by columns of monochrome uppercase only the original character set matches ascii characters to fh text on the screen with ntsc composite video output suitable for display on tv monitor or on regular tv set by way of separate rf modulator the original retail price of the computer with kib of ram was and with the maximum kb of ram to reflect the computer color graphics capability the apple logo on the casing had rainbow stripes which remained part of apple corporate logo until early perhaps most significantly the apple ii was catalyst for personal computers across many industries it opened the doors to software marketed at consumers overview in the may issue of byte steve wozniak published detailed description of his design the article began to me personal computer should be small reliable convenient to use and inexpensive the apple ii used peculiar engineering shortcuts to save hardware and reduce costs such as taking advantage of the way the processor accesses memory occurs only on alternate phases of the clock cycle the video generation circuitry memory access on the otherwise unused phase avoids memory contention issues and interruptions of the video stream this arrangement simultaneously eliminated the need for separate refresh circuit for the dram chips as the video transfer accessed each row of the dynamic memory within the timeout period in addition it did not require separate ram chips for the video ram while the pet and trs had srams for the video rather than use complex analog to digital circuit to read the outputs of the game controller wozniak used simple timer circuit whose period is proportional to the resistance of the game controller and used software loop to measure the timer single mhz master oscillator fm was divided by various ratios to produce all other required frequencies including the microprocessor clock signals fm the video transfer counters and the color burst samples fm the text and graphics screens have complex arrangement for instance the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory this complexity was reportedly due to wozniak realization that the method would allow for the refresh of the dynamic ram as side effect as described above this method had no cost overhead to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline and avoided the need for significant extra hardware similarly in the high resolution graphics mode color is determined by pixel position and thus can be implemented in software saving wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors this also allowed for subpixel font rendering since orange and blue pixels appear half pixel width farther to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels the apple ii at first used data cassette storage like most other microcomputers of the time in the company introduced an external inch floppy disk drive the disk ii attached via controller card that plugs into one of the computer expansion slots usually slot the disk ii interface created by wozniak is regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components the approach taken in the disk ii controller is typical of wozniak designs with few small scale logic chips and cheap prom programmable read only memory he created functional floppy disk interface at fraction of the component cost of standard circuit configurations case design steve jobs extensively pushed to give the apple ii case that looked visually appealing and sellable to people outside of electronics hobbyists rather than the generic wood and metal boxes typical of early microcomputers the result was futuristic looking molded white plastic case jobs also paid close attention to the keyboard design and decided to use dark brown keycaps as it contrasted well with the case the first production apple ii had hand molded cases these had visible bubbles and other lumps in them from the imperfect plastic molding process which was soon switched to machine molding in addition the initial case design had no vent openings causing high heat buildup from the pcb and resulting in the
