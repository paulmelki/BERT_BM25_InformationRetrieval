alexander the great in diving bell scene from the line namesake the roman alexandre alexandrine is name used for several distinct types of verse line with related metrical structures most of which are ultimately derived from the classical french alexandrine the line name derives from its use in the medieval french roman alexandre of although it had already been used several decades earlier in le pèlerinage de charlemagne the foundation of most alexandrines consists of two hemistichs half lines of six syllables each separated by caesura metrical pause or word break which may or may not be realized as stronger syntactic break any syllable caesura however no tradition remains this simple each applies additional constraints such as obligatory stress or nonstress on certain syllables and options such as permitted or required additional syllable at the end of one or both hemistichs thus line that is metrical in one tradition may be unmetrical in another scope of the term the term alexandrine may be used with greater or lesser rigor peureux suggests that only french syllabic verse with structure is strictly speaking an alexandrine preminger et al allow broader scope strictly speaking the term alexandrine is appropriate to french syllabic meters and it may be applied to other metrical systems only where they too espouse syllabism as their principle introduce phrasal accentuation or rigorously observe the medial caesura as in french common usage within the literatures of european languages is broader still embracing lines syllabic accentual syllabic and inevitably stationed ambivalently between the two lines of or even syllables lines with obligatory predominant and optional caesurae french although alexandrines occurred in french verse as early as the th century they were slightly looser rhythmically and vied with the décasyllabe and octosyllabe for cultural prominence and use in various genres the alexandrine came into its own in the middle of the sixteenth century with the poets of the pléiade and was firmly established in the seventeenth century it became the preferred line for the prestigious genres of epic and tragedy the structure of the classical french alexandrine is stressed syllable optional mute classical alexandrines are always rhymed often in couplets alternating masculine rhymes and feminine rhymes though other configurations such as quatrains and sonnets are also common victor hugo began the process of loosening the strict two hemistich structure while retaining the medial caesura he often reduced it to mere word break creating three part line alexandrin ternaire with this structure strong caesura word break the symbolists further weakened the classical structure sometimes eliminating any or all of these caesurae however at no point did the newer line replace the older rather they were used concurrently often in the same poem this loosening process eventually led to vers libéré and finally to vers libre english in english verse alexandrine is typically used to mean iambic hexameter ictus strong syllabic position nonictus often mandatory or predominant caesura but depends upon the author whereas the french alexandrine is syllabic the english is accentual syllabic and the central caesura defining feature of the french is not always rigidly preserved in english though english alexandrines have occasionally provided the sole metrical line for poem for example in lyric poems by henry howard earl of surrey and sir philip sidney and in two notable long poems michael drayton poly olbion and robert browning fifine at the fair they have more often featured alongside other lines during the middle ages they typically occurred with heptameters seven beat lines both exhibiting metrical looseness around the mid th century stricter alexandrines were popular as the first line of poulter measure couplets fourteeners strict iambic heptameters providing the second line the strict english alexandrine may be exemplified by passage from poly olbion which features rare caesural enjambment symbolized in the first line ye sacred bards that to your harps melodious strings sung th ancient heroes deeds the monuments of kings and in your dreadful verse ingrav the prophecies the agèd world descents and genealogies lines the faerie queene by edmund spenser with its stanzas of eight iambic pentameter lines followed by one alexandrine exemplifies what came to be its chief role as somewhat infrequent variant line in an otherwise iambic pentameter context alexandrines provide occasional variation in the blank verse of william shakespeare and his contemporaries but rarely they constitute only about of shakespeare blank verse john dryden and his contemporaries and followers likewise occasionally employed them as the second rarely the first line of heroic couplets or even more distinctively as the third line of triplet in his essay on criticism alexander pope denounced and parodied the excessive and unskillful use of this practice then at the last and only couplet fraught with some unmeaning thing they call thought needless alexandrine ends the song that like wounded snake drags its slow length along lines other languages spanish the spanish alejandrino is line of syllables probably developed in imitation of the french alexandrine its structure is it was used beginning about for mester de clerecía clerical verse typically occurring in the cuaderna vía stanza of four alejandrinos all with single end rhyme the alejandrino was most prominent during the th and th centuries after which time it was eclipsed by the metrically more flexible arte mayor juan ruiz book of good love is one of the best known examples of cuaderna vía though other verse forms also appear in the work dutch the mid th century poet jan van der noot pioneered syllabic dutch alexandrines on the french model but within few decades dutch alexandrines had been transformed into strict iambic hexameters with caesura after the third foot from holland the accentual syllabic alexandrine spread to other continental literatures german similarly in early th century germany georg rudolf weckherlin advocated for an alexandrine with free rhythms reflecting french practice whereas martin opitz advocated for strict accentual syllabic iambic alexandrine in imitation of contemporary dutch practice and german poets followed opitz the alexandrine strictly iambic with consistent medial caesura became the dominant
