astatine is chemical element with the symbol at and atomic number it is the rarest naturally occurring element in the earth crust occurring only as the decay product of various heavier elements all of astatine isotopes are short lived the most stable is astatine with half life of hours sample of the pure element has never been assembled because any macroscopic specimen would be immediately vaporized by the heat of its own radioactivity the bulk properties of astatine are not known with certainty many of them have been estimated based on the element position on the periodic table as heavier analog of iodine and member of the halogens the group of elements including fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine astatine is likely to have dark or lustrous appearance and may be semiconductor or possibly metal it probably has higher melting point than that of iodine chemically several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine it also shows some metallic behavior including being able to form stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution unlike the lighter halogens the first synthesis of the element was in by dale corson kenneth ross mackenzie and emilio segrè at the university of california berkeley who named it from the greek astatos ἄστατος meaning unstable four isotopes of astatine were subsequently found to be naturally occurring although much less than one gram is present at any given time in the earth crust neither the most stable isotope astatine nor the medically useful astatine occur naturally they can only be produced synthetically usually by bombarding bismuth with alpha particles characteristics astatine is an extremely radioactive element all its isotopes have half lives of hours or less decaying into other astatine isotopes bismuth polonium or radon most of its isotopes are very unstable with half lives of one second or less of the first elements in the periodic table only francium is less stable and all the astatine isotopes more stable than francium are in any case synthetic and do not occur in nature the bulk properties of astatine are not known with any certainty research is limited by its short half life which prevents the creation of weighable quantities visible piece of astatine would immediately vaporize itself because of the heat generated by its intense radioactivity it remains to be seen if with sufficient cooling macroscopic quantity of astatine could be deposited as thin film astatine is usually classified as either nonmetal or metalloid metal formation has also been predicted physical most of the physical properties of astatine have been estimated by interpolation or extrapolation using theoretically or empirically derived methods for example halogens get darker with increasing atomic weight fluorine is nearly colorless chlorine is yellow green bromine is red brown and iodine is dark gray violet astatine is sometimes described as probably being black solid assuming it follows this trend or as having metallic appearance if it is metalloid or metal the melting and boiling points of astatine are also expected to follow the trend seen in the halogen series increasing with atomic number on this basis they are estimated to be respectively some experimental evidence suggests astatine may have lower melting and boiling points than those implied by the halogen trend chromatographic estimation of the boiling point of elemental astatine in suggested boiling point of about or astatine sublimes less readily than does iodine having lower vapor pressure even so half of given quantity of astatine will vaporize in approximately an hour if put on clean glass surface at room temperature the absorption spectrum of astatine in the middle ultraviolet region has lines at and nm suggestive of to transitions the structure of solid astatine is unknown as an analogue of iodine it may have an orthorhombic crystalline structure composed of diatomic astatine molecules and be semiconductor with band gap of ev alternatively if condensed astatine forms metallic phase as has been predicted it may have monatomic face centered cubic structure in this structure it may well be superconductor like the similar high pressure phase of iodine evidence for or against the existence of diatomic astatine at is sparse and inconclusive some sources state that it does not exist or at least has never been observed while other sources assert or imply its existence despite this controversy many properties of diatomic astatine have been predicted for example its bond length would be dissociation energy and heat of vaporization hvap kj mol the latter figure means that astatine may at least be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with heat of vaporization greater than kj mol are metallic when liquid diatomic iodine with value of kj mol falls just short of the threshold figure chemical the chemistry of astatine is clouded by the extremely low concentrations at which astatine experiments have been conducted and the possibility of reactions with impurities walls and filters or radioactivity by products and other unwanted nano scale interactions many of its apparent chemical properties have been observed using tracer studies on extremely dilute astatine solutions typically less than mol some properties such as anion formation align with other halogens astatine has some metallic characteristics as well such as plating onto cathode coprecipitating with metal sulfides in hydrochloric acid and forming stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution it forms complexes with edta metal chelating agent and is capable of acting as metal in antibody radiolabeling in some respects astatine in the state is akin to silver in the same state most of the organic chemistry of astatine is however analogous to that of iodine astatine has an of on the revised pauling scale lower than that of iodine and the same as hydrogen in hydrogen astatide hat the negative charge is predicted to be on the hydrogen atom implying that this compound could be referred to as astatine hydride according to certain nomenclatures that would be consistent with the of astatine on the allred rochow scale being less than that of
