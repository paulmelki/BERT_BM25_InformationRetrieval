archimedes of syracuse was greek mathematician physicist engineer inventor and astronomer although few details of his life are known he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity considered to be the greatest mathematician of ancient history and one of the greatest of all time archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying concepts of infinitesimals and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove range of geometrical theorems including the area of circle the surface area and volume of sphere area of an ellipse the area under parabola the volume of segment of paraboloid of revolution the volume of segment of hyperboloid of revolution and the area of spiral his other mathematical achievements include deriving an accurate approximation of pi defining and investigating the spiral that now bears his name and creating system using exponentiation for expressing very large numbers he was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena founding hydrostatics and statics including an explanation of the principle of the lever he is credited with designing innovative machines such as his screw pump compound pulleys and defensive war machines to protect his native syracuse from invasion archimedes died during the siege of syracuse where he was killed by roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed cicero describes visiting the tomb of archimedes which was surmounted by sphere and cylinder which archimedes had requested be placed on his tomb to represent his mathematical discoveries unlike his inventions the mathematical writings of archimedes were little known in antiquity mathematicians from alexandria read and quoted him but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until by isidore of miletus in byzantine constantinople while commentaries on the works of archimedes written by eutocius in the th century ad opened them to wider readership for the first time the relatively few copies of archimedes written work that survived through the middle ages were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the renaissance while the discovery in of previously unknown works by archimedes in the archimedes palimpsest has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results biography archimedes was born in the seaport city of syracuse sicily at that time self governing colony in magna graecia the date of birth is based on statement by the byzantine greek historian john tzetzes that archimedes lived for years in the sand reckoner archimedes gives his father name as phidias an astronomer about whom nothing else is known plutarch wrote in his parallel lives that archimedes was related to king hiero ii the ruler of syracuse biography of archimedes was written by his friend heracleides but this work has been lost leaving the details of his life obscure it is unknown for instance whether he ever married or had children during his youth archimedes may have studied in alexandria egypt where conon of samos and eratosthenes of cyrene were contemporaries he referred to conon of samos as his friend while two of his works the method of mechanical theorems and the cattle problem have introductions addressed to eratosthenes the death of archimedes by thomas degeorge archimedes died during the second punic war when roman forces under general marcus claudius marcellus captured the city of syracuse after two year long siege according to the popular account given by plutarch archimedes was contemplating mathematical diagram when the city was captured roman soldier commanded him to come and meet general marcellus but he declined saying that he had to finish working on the problem the soldier was enraged by this and killed archimedes with his sword plutarch also gives account of the death of archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to roman soldier according to this story archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items general marcellus was reportedly angered by the death of archimedes as he considered him valuable scientific asset and had ordered that he must not be harmed marcellus called archimedes geometrical briareus the last words attributed to archimedes are do not disturb my circles reference to the circles in the mathematical drawing that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the roman soldier this quote is often given in latin as noli turbare circulos meos but there is no reliable evidence that archimedes uttered these words and they do not appear in the account given by plutarch valerius maximus writing in memorable doings and sayings in the st century ad gives the phrase as but protecting the dust with his hands said beg of you do not disturb this the phrase is also given in katharevousa greek as cicero discovering the tomb of archimedes by benjamin west the tomb of archimedes carried sculpture illustrating his favorite mathematical proof consisting of sphere and cylinder of the same height and diameter archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases in bc years after his death the roman orator cicero was serving as quaestor in sicily he had heard stories about the tomb of archimedes but none of the locals were able to give him the location eventually he found the tomb near the agrigentine gate in syracuse in neglected condition and overgrown with bushes cicero had the tomb cleaned up and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription tomb discovered in the courtyard of the hotel panorama in syracuse in the early was claimed to be that of archimedes but there was no compelling evidence for this and the location of his tomb today is unknown the standard versions of the life of archimedes were written long after his death by the historians of ancient rome the account of the siege of syracuse given by polybius in his the histories was written around seventy years after archimedes death and was used subsequently as
