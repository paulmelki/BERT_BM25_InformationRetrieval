ammianus marcellinus born died was roman soldier and historian who wrote the penultimate major historical account surviving from antiquity preceding procopius his work known as the res gestae chronicled in latin the history of rome from the accession of the emperor nerva in to the death of valens at the battle of adrianople in although only the sections covering the period to survive biography bust of emperor constantius ii from syria ammianus was born in the greek speaking east possibly in syria or phoenicia in his native language was most likely greek the surviving books of his history cover the years to ammianus served as an officer in the army of the emperors constantius ii and julian he served in gaul julian and in the east twice for constantius once under julian he professes to have been former soldier and greek miles quondam et graecus and his enrollment among the elite protectores domestici household guards shows that he was of middle class or higher birth consensus is that ammianus probably came from curial family but it is also possible that he was the son of comes orientis of the same family name he entered the army at an early age when constantius ii was emperor of the east and was sent to serve under ursicinus governor of nisibis in mesopotamia and magister militum ammianus campaigned in the east twice under ursicinus the walls of amida built by constantius ii before the siege of amida of ammianus himself was present in the city until day before its fall he travelled with ursicinus to italy when ursicinus was called on by constantius to begin an expedition against claudius silvanus silvanus had been forced by the allegedly false accusations of his enemies into proclaiming himself emperor in gaul ursicinus had one of his men assassinate silvanus restoring gaul to constantius he then stayed in gaul to help install julian as caesar of gaul spain and britain ammianus probably met julian for the first time while serving on ursicinus staff in gaul in constantius sent ursicinus back to the east to help in the defence against persian invasion led by king shapur ii himself ammianus returned with his commander to the east and again served ursicinus as staff officer ursicinus although he was the more experienced commander was placed under the command of sabinianus the magister peditum of the east the two did not get along resulting in lack of cooperation between the limitanei border regiments of mesopotamia and osrhoene under ursicinus command and the comitatus field army of sabinianus while on mission near nisibis ammianus spotted persian patrol which was about to try and capture ursicinus he was able to warn his commander in time in an attempt to locate the persian royal army ursicinus sent ammianus to jovinianus the semi independent governor of corduene and friend of ursicinus ammianus successfully located the persian main body and reported his findings to ursicinus after his mission in corduene amminianus accompanied his commander when the latter rode out from his headquarters at amida on mission to make sure the bridges across the euphrates were demolished they were attacked by the persian vanguard who had made night march in an attempt to catch the romans at amida off guard after protracted cavalry battle the romans were scattered ursicinus evaded capture and fled to melitene while ammianus barely made it back to amida with wounded comrade the persians started to besiege the city when it fell ammianus barely escaped with his life when ursicinus was dismissed from his military post by constantius ammianus too seems to have retired from the military however reevaluation of his participation in julian persian campaigns has led modern scholarship to suggest that he continued his service but did not for some reason include the period in his history he accompanied julian for whom he expresses enthusiastic admiration in his campaigns against the alamanni and the sassanids after julian death ammianus accompanied the retreat of the new emperor jovian as far as antioch he was residing in antioch in when certain theodorus was thought to have been identified the successor to the emperor valens by divination speaking as an alleged eyewitness marcellinus recounts how theodorus and several others were made to confess their deceit through the use of torture and cruelly punished julian on bronze coin of antioch he eventually settled in rome and began the res gestae the precise year of his death is unknown but scholarly consensus places it somewhere between and at the latest modern scholarship generally describes ammianus as pagan who was tolerant of christianity marcellinus writes of christianity as being pure and simple religion that demands only what is just and mild and when he condemns the actions of christians he does not do so on the basis of their christianity as such his lifetime was marked by lengthy outbreaks of sectarian and dogmatic strife within the new state backed faith often with violent consequences especially the arian controversy and these conflicts sometimes appeared unworthy to him though it was territory where he could not risk going very far in criticism due to the growing and volatile political connections between the church and imperial power he was not blind to the faults of christians or of pagans he observed in his res gestae that no wild beasts are so deadly to humans as most christians are to each other and he condemns his hero julian for excessive attachment to pagan sacrifice and for his edict effectively barring christians from teaching posts work while living in rome in the ammianus wrote latin history of the roman empire from the accession of nerva to the death of valens at the battle of adrianople in effect writing continuation of the history of tacitus he presumably completed the work before as at he praises the serapeum in egypt as the glory of the empire it was in that same year the emperor granted the temple grounds to christian bishop provoking pagans into
