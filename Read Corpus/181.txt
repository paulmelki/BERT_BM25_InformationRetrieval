an axiom postulate or assumption is statement that is taken to be true to serve as premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments the word comes from the greek axíōma that which is thought worthy or fit or that which commends itself as evident the term has subtle differences in definition when used in the context of different fields of study as defined in classic philosophy an axiom is statement that is so evident or well established that it is accepted without controversy or question as used in modern logic an axiom is premise or starting point for reasoning as used in mathematics the term axiom is used in two related but distinguishable senses logical axioms and non logical axioms logical axioms are usually statements that are taken to be true within the system of logic they define and are often shown in symbolic form and implies while non logical axioms are actually substantive assertions about the elements of the domain of specific mathematical theory such as arithmetic when used in the latter sense axiom postulate and assumption may be used interchangeably in most cases non logical axiom is simply formal logical expression used in deduction to build mathematical theory and might or might not be self evident in nature parallel postulate in euclidean geometry to axiomatize system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from small well understood set of sentences the axioms and there may be multiple ways to axiomatize given mathematical domain any axiom is statement that serves as starting point from which other statements are logically derived whether it is meaningful and if so what it means for an axiom to be true is subject of debate in the philosophy of mathematics etymology the word axiom comes from the greek word axíōma verbal noun from the verb axioein meaning to deem worthy but also to require which in turn comes from áxios meaning being in balance and hence having the same value as worthy proper among the ancient greek philosophers an axiom was claim which could be seen to be self evidently true without any need for proof the root meaning of the word postulate is to demand for instance euclid demands that one agree that some things can be done any two points can be joined by straight line ancient geometers maintained some distinction between axioms and postulates while commenting on euclid books proclus remarks that geminus held that this th postulate should not be classed as postulate but as an axiom since it does not like the first three postulates assert the possibility of some construction but expresses an essential property boethius translated postulate as petitio and called the axioms notiones communes but in later manuscripts this usage was not always strictly kept historical development early greeks the logico deductive method whereby conclusions new knowledge follow from premises old knowledge through the application of sound arguments syllogisms rules of inference was developed by the ancient greeks and has become the core principle of modern mathematics tautologies excluded nothing can be deduced if nothing is assumed axioms and postulates are thus the basic assumptions underlying given body of deductive knowledge they are accepted without demonstration all other assertions theorems in the case of mathematics must be proven with the aid of these basic assumptions however the interpretation of mathematical knowledge has changed from ancient times to the modern and consequently the terms axiom and postulate hold slightly different meaning for the present day mathematician than they did for aristotle and euclid the ancient greeks considered geometry as just one of several sciences and held the theorems of geometry on par with scientific facts as such they developed and used the logico deductive method as means of avoiding error and for structuring and communicating knowledge aristotle posterior analytics is definitive exposition of the classical view an axiom in classical terminology referred to self evident assumption common to many branches of science good example would be the assertion that when an equal amount is taken from equals an equal amount results at the foundation of the various sciences lay certain additional hypotheses that were accepted without proof such hypothesis was termed postulate while the axioms were common to many sciences the postulates of each particular science were different their validity had to be established by means of real world experience aristotle warns that the content of science cannot be successfully communicated if the learner is in doubt about the truth of the postulates the classical approach is well illustrated by euclid elements where list of postulates is given common sensical geometric facts drawn from our experience followed by list of common notions very basic self evident assertions postulates it is possible to draw straight line from any point to any other point it is possible to extend line segment continuously in both directions it is possible to describe circle with any center and any radius it is true that all right angles are equal to one another parallel postulate it is true that if straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles the two straight lines if produced indefinitely intersect on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles common notions things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another if equals are added to equals the wholes are equal if equals are subtracted from equals the remainders are equal things which coincide with one another are equal to one another the whole is greater than the part modern development lesson learned by mathematics in the last years is that it is useful to strip the meaning away from the mathematical assertions axioms postulates propositions theorems and definitions one must concede the need for primitive notions or undefined terms or concepts in any study such abstraction or formalization makes mathematical knowledge more general capable of multiple different meanings and
