chemical structure of methane the simplest alkane in organic chemistry an alkane or paraffin historical name that also has other meanings is an acyclic saturated hydrocarbon in other words an alkane consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in tree structure in which all the carbon carbon bonds are single alkanes have the general chemical formula the alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of methane ch where sometimes called the parent molecule to arbitrarily large and complex molecules like pentacontane or ethyl methyl methylethyl octane an isomer of tetradecane international union of pure and applied chemistry defines alkanes as acyclic branched or unbranched hydrocarbons having the general formula and therefore consisting entirely of hydrogen atoms and saturated carbon atoms however some sources use the term to denote any saturated hydrocarbon including those that are either monocyclic the cycloalkanes or polycyclic despite their having distinct general formula cycloalkanes are in an alkane each carbon atom is sp hybridized with sigma bonds either or and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms in bond the longest series of linked carbon atoms in molecule is known as its carbon skeleton or carbon backbone the number of carbon atoms may be considered as the size of the alkane one group of the higher alkanes are waxes solids at standard ambient temperature and pressure satp for which the number of carbon atoms in the carbon backbone is greater than about with their repeated ch units the alkanes constitute homologous series of organic compounds in which the members differ in molecular mass by multiples of the total mass of each such methylene bridge unit which comprises single carbon atom of mass and two hydrogen atoms of mass each methane is produced by methanogenic bacteria and some long chain alkanes function as pheromones in certain animal species or as protective waxes in plants and fungi nevertheless most alkanes do not have much biological activity they can be viewed as molecular trees upon which can be hung the more active reactive functional groups of biological molecules the alkanes have two main commercial sources petroleum crude oil and natural gas an alkyl group is an alkane based molecular fragment that bears one open valence for bonding they are generally abbreviated with the symbol for any organyl group although alk is sometimes used to specifically symbolize an alkyl group as opposed to an alkenyl group or aryl group structure and classification saturated hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons having only single covalent bonds between their carbons they can be linear general formula wherein the carbon atoms are joined in snake like structure branched general formula wherein the carbon backbone splits off in one or more directions cyclic general formula wherein the carbon backbone is linked so as to form loop according to the definition by iupac the former two are alkanes whereas the third group is called cycloalkanes saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear cyclic polycyclic and branching structures the general formula is where is the number of independent loops alkanes are the acyclic loopless ones corresponding to isomerism butane and isobutane are the two isomers cyclobutane and are the two alkane isomers bicyclobutane bicyclo butane is the only alkane and has no alkane isomer tetrahedrane below is the only alkane and so has no alkane isomer tetrahedrane alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in various ways forming structural isomers the simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in single chain with no branches this isomer is sometimes called the isomer for normal although it is not necessarily the most common however the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points the number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms for example for acyclic alkanes methane only ethane only propane only isomers butane and isobutane isomers pentane isopentane and neopentane isomers hexane methylpentane methylpentane dimethylbutane and dimethylbutane isomers heptane methylhexane isomers dimethylpentane isomers ethylpentane trimethylbutane isomers isomers isomers many of which are not stable branched alkanes can be chiral for example methylhexane and its higher homologues are chiral due to their stereogenic center at carbon atom number the above list only includes differences of connectivity not stereochemistry in addition to the alkane isomers the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more rings such compounds are called cycloalkanes and are also excluded from the above list because changing the number of rings changes the molecular formula cyclobutane and are isomers of each other but are not isomers of butane nomenclature the iupac nomenclature systematic way of naming compounds for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains unbranched saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix ane in august wilhelm von hofmann suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels and to create suffixes ane ene ine or yne one une for the hydrocarbons now the first three name hydrocarbons with single double and triple bonds one represents ketone ol represents an alcohol or oh group oxy means an ether and refers to oxygen between two carbons so that methoxymethane is the iupac name for dimethyl ether it is difficult or impossible to find compounds with more than one iupac name this is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets numbers in the name referring to which carbon group is attached to should be as low as possible so that is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one side group symmetric compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same name linear alkanes straight chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix or for normal where non linear isomer exists although this is not strictly necessary the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight chain and branched chain
