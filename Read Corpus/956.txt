nitrocellulose adhesive dispensed from tube adhesive also known as glue cement mucilage or paste is any non metallic substance applied to one or both surfaces of two separate items that binds them together and resists their separation the use of adhesives offers certain advantages over other binding techniques such as sewing mechanical fastenings or welding these include the ability to bind different materials together the more efficient distribution of stress across joint the cost effectiveness of an easily mechanized process and greater flexibility in design disadvantages of adhesive use include decreased stability at high temperatures relative weakness in bonding large objects with small bonding surface area and greater difficulty in separating objects during testing adhesives are typically organized by the method of adhesion followed by reactive or non reactive term which refers to whether the adhesive chemically reacts in order to harden alternatively they can be organized either by their starting physical phase or whether their raw stock is of natural or synthetic origin adhesives may be found naturally or produced synthetically the earliest human use of adhesive like substances was approximately years ago when neanderthals produced tar from the dry distillation of birch bark for use in binding stone tools to wooden handles the first references to adhesives in literature appeared in approximately bc the greeks and romans made great contributions to the development of adhesives in europe glue was not widely used until the period ad from then until the increases in adhesive use and discovery were relatively gradual only since the last century has the development of synthetic adhesives accelerated rapidly and innovation in the field continues to the present history reconstruction of ötzi axe which used pitch as an adhesive left lime factory in ukraine liquid animal glue casein glue preparation the earliest known use of adhesives was discovered in central italy when two stone flakes partially covered with birch bark tar and third uncovered stone from the middle pleistocene era circa years ago were found this is thought to be the oldest discovered human use of tar hafted stones the birch bark tar adhesive is simple one component adhesive study from showed that birch tar production can be very simple process merely involving the burning of birch bark near smooth vertical surfaces in open air conditions although sticky enough plant based adhesives are brittle and vulnerable to environmental conditions the first use of compound adhesives was discovered in sibudu south africa here year old stone segments that were once inserted in axe hafts were discovered covered with an adhesive composed of plant gum and red ochre natural iron oxide as adding ochre to plant gum produces stronger product and protects the gum from disintegrating under wet conditions the ability to produce stronger adhesives allowed middle stone age humans to attach stone segments to sticks in greater variations which led to the development of new tools more recent examples of adhesive use by prehistoric humans have been found at the burial sites of ancient tribes archaeologists studying the sites found that approximately years ago the tribesmen had buried their dead together with food found in broken clay pots repaired with tree resins another investigation by archaeologists uncovered the use of bituminous cements to fasten ivory eyeballs to statues in babylonian temples dating to approximately bc in paper revealed the discovery of year old man nicknamed the tyrolean iceman or ötzi who was preserved in glacier near the austria italy border several of his belongings were found with him including two arrows with flint arrowheads and copper hatchet each with evidence of organic glue used to connect the stone or metal parts to the wooden shafts the glue was analyzed as pitch which requires the heating of tar during its production the retrieval of this tar requires transformation of birch bark by means of heat in process known as pyrolysis the first references to adhesives in literature appeared in approximately bc further historical records of adhesive use are found from the period spanning bc artifacts from this period include paintings depicting wood gluing operations and casket made of wood and glue in king tutankhamun tomb other ancient egyptian artifacts employ animal glue for bonding or lamination such lamination of wood for bows and furniture is thought to have extended their life and was accomplished using casein milk protein based glues the ancient egyptians also developed starch based pastes for the bonding of papyrus to clothing and plaster of paris like material made of calcined gypsum from ad to the greeks and romans made great contributions to the development of adhesives wood veneering and marquetry were developed the production of animal and fish glues refined and other materials utilized egg based pastes were used to bond gold leaves incorporated various natural ingredients such as blood bone hide milk cheese vegetables and grains the greeks began the use of slaked lime as mortar while the romans furthered mortar development by mixing lime with volcanic ash and sand this material known as pozzolanic cement was used in the construction of the roman colosseum and pantheon the romans were also the first people known to have used tar and beeswax as caulk and sealant between the wooden planks of their boats and ships in central asia the rise of the mongols in approximately ad can be partially attributed to the good range and power of the bows of genghis khan hordes these bows were constructed with laminated lemonwood and bullhorn bonded by an unknown adhesive in europe glue fell into disuse until the period ad at this time world renowned cabinet and furniture makers such as thomas chippendale and duncan phyfe began to use adhesives to hold their products together in the first commercial glue plant was established in the netherlands this plant produced glues from animal hides in the first british glue patent was issued for fish glue the following decades of the next century witnessed the manufacture of casein glues in german and swiss factories in the first us
