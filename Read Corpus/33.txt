valleys of andorra and facing the carthaginian army in its passage through the pyrenees during the punic wars the word andosini or andosins ἀνδοσίνοι may derive from the basque handia whose meaning is big or giant the andorran toponymy shows evidence of basque language in the area another theory suggests that the word andorra may derive from the old word anorra that contains the basque word ur water another theory suggests that andorra may derive from meaning the thickly wooded place when the arabs and moors conquered the iberian peninsula the valleys of the high pyrenees were covered by large tracts of forest these regions were not administered by muslims because of the geographic difficulty of direct rule other theories suggest that the term derives from the navarro aragonese andurrial which means land covered with bushes or scrubland the folk etymology holds that charlemagne had named the region as reference to the biblical canaanite valley of endor or andor where the
