andrey andreyevich markov june july was russian mathematician best known for his work on stochastic processes primary subject of his research later became known as markov chains and markov processes markov and his younger brother vladimir andreyevich markov proved the markov brothers inequality his son another andrei andreyevich markov was also notable mathematician making contributions to constructive mathematics and recursive function theory biography andrey markov was born on june in russia he attended petersburg grammar where he was seen as rebellious student by select few teachers in his academics he performed poorly in most subjects other than mathematics later in life he attended petersburg university among his teachers were yulian sokhotski differential calculus higher algebra konstantin posse analytic geometry yegor zolotarev integral calculus pafnuty chebyshev number theory and probability theory aleksandr korkin ordinary and partial differential equations mikhail okatov mechanism theory osip somov mechanics and nikolai budajev descriptive and higher geometry he completed his studies at the university and was later asked if he would like to stay and have career as mathematician he later taught at high schools and continued his own mathematical studies in this time he found practical use for his mathematical skills he figured out that he could use chains to model the alliteration of vowels and consonants in russian literature he also contributed to many other mathematical aspects in his time he died at age on july timeline in markov was awarded gold medal for his outstanding solution of the problem about integration of differential equations by continued fractions with an application to the equation during the following year he passed the candidate examinations and he remained at the university to prepare for lecturer position in april markov defended his master thesis on the binary square forms with positive determinant which was encouraged by aleksandr korkin and yegor zolotarev four years later in he defended his doctoral thesis titled on certain applications of the algebraic continuous fractions his pedagogical work began after the defense of his master thesis in autumn as privatdozent he lectured on differential and integral calculus later he lectured alternately on introduction to analysis probability theory succeeding chebyshev who had left the university in and the calculus of differences from through he also lectured in differential calculus markov in one year after the defense of his doctoral thesis markov was appointed extraordinary professor and in the same year he was elected adjunct to the academy of sciences in after the death of viktor bunyakovsky markov became an extraordinary member of the academy his promotion to an ordinary professor of st petersburg university followed in the fall of in markov was elected an ordinary member of the academy as the successor of chebyshev in he was appointed merited professor and was granted the right to retire which he did immediately until however he continued to lecture in the calculus of differences in connection with student riots in professors and lecturers of st petersburg university were ordered to monitor their students markov refused to accept this decree and he wrote an explanation in which he declined to be an agent of the governance markov was removed from further teaching duties at st petersburg university and hence he decided to retire from the university markov was an atheist in he protested leo tolstoy excommunication from the russian orthodox church by requesting his own excommunication the church complied with his request markov headstone in the council of st petersburg elected nine scientists honorary members of the university markov was among them but his election was not affirmed by the minister of education the affirmation only occurred four years later after the february revolution in markov then resumed his teaching activities and lectured on probability theory and the calculus of differences until his death in see also chebyshev markov stieltjes inequalities gauss markov theorem gauss markov process hidden markov model markov blanket markov chain markov decision process markov inequality markov brothers inequality markov information source markov network markov number markov property markov process stochastic matrix also known as markov matrix subjunctive possibility notes references further reading марков распространение закона больших чисел на величины зависящие друг от друга известия физико математического общества при казанском университете серия том markov extension of the limit theorems of probability theory to sum of variables connected in chain reprinted in appendix of howard dynamic probabilistic systems volume markov chains john wiley and sons external links
