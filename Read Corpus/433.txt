hœnir lóðurr and odin create askr and embla by lorenz frølich in norse mythology ask and embla from male and female respectively were the first two humans created by the gods the pair are attested in both the poetic edda compiled in the th century from earlier traditional sources and the prose edda written in the th century by snorri sturluson in both sources three gods one of whom is odin find ask and embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures and there are occasional references to them in popular culture etymology depiction of ask and embla by robert engels old norse literally means ash tree but the etymology of embla is uncertain and two possibilities of the meaning of embla are generally proposed the first meaning elm tree is problematic and is reached by deriving elm la from almilōn and subsequently to elm the second suggestion is vine which is reached through ambilō which may be related to the greek term itself meaning vine liana the latter etymology has resulted in number of theories according to benjamin thorpe grimm says the word embla emla signifies busy woman from amr ambr aml ambl assiduous labour the same relation as meshia and meshiane the ancient persian names of the first man and woman who were also formed from trees attestations in stanza of the poetic edda poem völuspá the seeress reciting the poem states that hœnir lóðurr and odin once found ask and embla on land the seeress says that the two were capable of very little lacking in ørlög and says that they were given three gifts by the three gods old norse ǫnd þau né átto óð þau né hǫfðo lá né læti né lito góða ǫnd gaf óðinn óð gaf hœnir lá gaf lóðurr ok lito góða benjamin thorpe translation spirit they possessed not sense they had not blood nor motive powers nor goodly colour spirit gave odin sense gave hœnir blood gave lodur and goodly colour henry adams bellows translation soul they had not sense they had not heat nor motion nor goodly hue soul gave othin sense gave hönir heat gave lothur and goodly hue the meaning of these gifts has been matter of scholarly disagreement and translations therefore vary according to chapter of the prose edda book gylfaginning the three brothers vili vé and odin are the creators of the first man and woman the brothers were once walking along beach and found two trees there they took the wood and from it created the first human beings ask and embla one of the three gave them the breath of life the second gave them movement and intelligence and the third gave them shape speech hearing and sight further the three gods gave them clothing and names ask and embla go on to become the progenitors of all humanity and were given home within the walls of midgard theories ask och embla by stig blomberg indo european origins proto indo european basis has been theorized for the duo based on the etymology of embla meaning vine in indo european societies an analogy is derived from the drilling of fire and sexual intercourse vines were used as flammable wood where they were placed beneath drill made of harder wood resulting in fire further evidence of ritual making of fire in scandinavia has been theorized from depiction on stone plate on bronze age grave in kivik scania sweden jaan puhvel comments that ancient myths teem with trite first couples of the type of adam and his by product eve in indo european tradition these range from the vedic yama and yamī and the iranian mašya and mašyānag to the icelandic askr and embla with trees or rocks as preferred raw material and dragon teeth or other bony substance occasionally thrown in for good measure in his study of the comparative evidence for an origin of mankind from trees in indo european society anders hultgård observes that myths of the origin of mankind from trees or wood seem to be particularly connected with ancient europe and indo europe and indo european speaking peoples of asia minor and iran by contrast the cultures of the near east show almost exclusively the type of anthropogonic stories that derive man origin from clay earth or blood by means of divine creation act other potential germanic analogues two wooden figures the braak bog figures of more than human height were unearthed from peat bog at braak in schleswig germany the figures depict nude male and nude female hilda ellis davidson comments that these figures may represent lord and lady of the vanir group of norse gods and that another memory of these wooden deities may survive in the tradition of the creation of ask and embla the man and woman who founded the human race created by the gods from trees on the seashore figure named æsc old english ash tree appears as the son of hengest in the anglo saxon genealogy for the kings of kent this has resulted in number of theories that the figures may have had an earlier basis in pre norse germanic mythology connections have been proposed between ask and embla and the vandal kings assi and ambri attested in paul the deacon th century ad work origo gentis langobardorum there the two ask the god godan odin for victory the name ambri like embla likely derives from ambilō catalog of dwarfs stanza preceding the account of the creation of ask and embla in völuspá provides catalog of dwarfs and stanza has been considered as describing the creation of human forms from the earth this may potentially mean that dwarfs formed humans and that the three gods gave them life carolyne larrington theorizes that humans are metaphorically designated as trees in old norse works examples include trees of jewellery for women and trees of battle for men due to the origin of humankind
