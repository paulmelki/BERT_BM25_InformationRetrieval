technique as well alexander began developing his technique principles in the in an attempt to address his own voice loss during public speaking he credited his method with allowing him to pursue his passion for performing shakespearean recitations proponents and teachers of the alexander technique believe the technique can address variety of health conditions but there is lack of research to support the claims as of there was evidence suggesting the alexander technique may be helpful for long term back pain long term neck pain and could help people cope with parkinson disease however both aetna and the australian department of health have conducted reviews and concluded that there is insufficient evidence for technique health claims to warrant insurance coverage uses the alexander technique is used and taught by classically trained vocal coaches and musicians in schools and private lessons its advocates state that it allows for balanced use of all aspects of the vocal tract by consciously increasing air flow allowing improved vocal skill and tone the method is said by actors to reduce stage fright and to increase spontaneity the alexander technique is frequent component in acting training because it can assist the actor in being more natural in performance according to alexander technique instructor michael gelb people tend to study the alexander technique for reasons of personal development health effects review of evidence for alexander technique for various health conditions provided by uk nhs choices last updated in said that advocates of the technique made claims for it that were not supported by evidence but that there was evidence suggesting that it might help with long term back pain lessons in the technique may lead to reduced back pain associated disability and reduce how often you feel pain for up to year or more long term neck pain lessons in the technique may lead to reduced neck pain and associated disability for up to year or more parkinson disease lessons in the technique may help you carry out everyday tasks more easily and improve how you feel about your condition nhs choices also states that some research has also suggested the alexander technique may improve general long term pain stammering and balance skills in elderly people to help them avoid falls but the evidence in these areas is limited and more studies are needed there currently little evidence to suggest the alexander technique can help improve other health conditions including asthma headaches osteoarthritis difficulty sleeping insomnia and stress review published in bmc complementary and alternative medicine in focused on the evidence for the effectiveness of at sessions on musicians performance anxiety respiratory function and posture concluded that evidence from rcts and cts suggests that at sessions may improve performance anxiety in musicians effects on music performance respiratory function and posture yet remain inconclusive review published in the international journal of clinical practice in found strong evidence exists for the effectiveness of alexander technique lessons for chronic back pain and moderate evidence in parkinson associated disability preliminary evidence suggests that alexander technique lessons may lead to improvements in balance skills in the elderly in general chronic pain posture respiratory function and stuttering but there is insufficient evidence to support recommendations in these areas cochrane systematic review found that there is no conclusive evidence that the alexander technique is effective for treating asthma and randomized clinical trials are needed in order to assess the effectiveness of this type of treatment approach review by aetna last updated in stated aetna considers the following alternative medicine interventions experimental and investigational because there is inadequate evidence in the peer reviewed published medical literature of their effectiveness the alexander technique is included in that list review published in and conducted for the australia department of health in order to determine what services the australian government should pay for reviewed clinical trials published to date and found that overall the evidence was limited by the small number of participants in the intervention arms wide confidence intervals or lack of replication of results it concluded that the alexander technique may improve short term pain and disability in people with low back pain but the longer term effects remain uncertain for all other clinical conditions the effectiveness of alexander technique was deemed to be uncertain due to insufficient evidence it also noted that evidence for the safety of alexander technique was lacking with most trials not reporting on this outcome subsequently in the australian government named the alexander technique as practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy saying this step would ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence method the alexander technique is most commonly taught privately in series of to private lessons which may last from minutes to an hour students are often performers such as actors dancers musicians athletes and public speakers people who work on computers or those who are in frequent pain for other reasons instructors observe their students then show them how to move with better poise and less strain sessions include chair work often in front of mirror during which the instructor and the student will stand sit and lie down moving efficiently while maintaining comfortable relationship between the head neck and spine and table work or physical manipulation to qualify as teacher of alexander technique instructors are required to complete hours spanning three years of supervised teacher training the result must be satisfactory to qualified peers to gain membership in professional societies process alexander approach emphasizes awareness strategies applied to conducting oneself while in action which could be now called mindful action though in his four books he did not use that term
