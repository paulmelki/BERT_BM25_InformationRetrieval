is genus containing over species of flowering succulent plants the most widely known species is aloe vera or true aloe it is called this because it is cultivated as the standard source for assorted pharmaceutical purposes other species such as aloe ferox are also cultivated or harvested from the wild for similar applications the apg iv system places the genus in the family asphodelaceae subfamily asphodeloideae within the subfamily it may be placed in the tribe aloeae in the past it has been assigned to the family aloaceae now included in the asphodeloidae or to broadly circumscribed family liliaceae the lily family the plant agave americana which is sometimes called american aloe belongs to the asparagaceae different family the genus is native to tropical and southern africa

asphodelaceae sensu stricto before this was merged into the asphodelaceae sensu lato the circumscription of the genus has varied widely many genera such as lomatophyllum have been brought into synonymy species at one time placed in aloe such as agave americana have been moved to other genera molecular phylogenetic studies particularly from onwards suggested that as then circumscribed aloe was not monophyletic and should be divided into more tightly defined genera in john charles manning and coworkers produced phylogeny in which aloe was divided into six genera aloidendron kumara
