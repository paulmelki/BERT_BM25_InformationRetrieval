spartacus within the order even encyclopedia references vary on the goal of the order such as new advent saying the order was not egalitarian or democratic internally but sought to promote the doctrines of equality and freedom throughout society while others such as collier have said the aim was to combat religion and foster rationalism in its place the actual character of the society was an elaborate network of spies and counter spies each isolated cell of initiates reported to superior whom they did not know party structure that was effectively adopted by some later groups weishaupt was initiated into the masonic lodge theodor zum guten rath at munich in his project of illumination enlightening the understanding by the sun of reason which will dispel the clouds of superstition

nature freed of government and organized religion presenting their own system as pure masonry weishaupt and adolph freiherr knigge who organised his ritual structure greatly expanded the secret organisation contrary to immanuel kant famous dictum that enlightenment and weishaupt order was in some respects an expression of the enlightenment movement was the passage by man out of his self imposed immaturity through daring to make use of his own reason without the guidance of another weishaupt order of illuminati prescribed in great detail everything which the members had obediently to read and think so that dr wolfgang riedel has commented that this approach to illumination or enlightenment constituted degradation and twisting of the kantian principle of enlightenment riedel writes the independence of thought and judgement required by kant was specifically prevented by the order of the illuminati rules and regulations enlightenment takes place here if it takes place at all

regarded him as human devil and saw his mission as one of malevolent destructiveness others took more positive view including thomas jefferson who wrote in letter to james madison that barruel own parts of the book are perfectly the ravings of bedlamite and considered weishaupt as an enthusiastic philanthropist who believed in the indefinite perfectibility of man and his intention was simply to reinstate natural religion and by diffusing the light of his morality to teach us to govern ourselves in his defense weishaupt wrote kurze rechtfertigung meiner absichten in brief justification of my
