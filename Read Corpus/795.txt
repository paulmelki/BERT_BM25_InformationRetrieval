the acts of the apostles práxeis apostólōn often referred to simply as acts or formally the book of acts is the fifth book of the new testament it tells of the founding of the christian church and the spread of its message to the roman empire acts and the gospel of luke make up two part work luke acts by the same anonymous author usually dated to around ad although some experts now suggest the first part the gospel of luke tells how god fulfilled his plan for the world salvation through the life death and resurrection of jesus of nazareth the promised messiah acts continues the story of christianity in the st century beginning with the ascension of jesus to heaven the early chapters set in jerusalem describe the day of pentecost the coming of the holy spirit and the growth of the church in jerusalem initially the jews are receptive to the christian message but later they turn against the followers of jesus rejected by the jews the message is taken to the gentiles under the guidance of the apostle peter the later chapters tell of paul conversion his mission in asia minor and the aegean and finally his imprisonment in rome where as the book ends he awaits trial luke acts is an attempt to answer theological problem namely how the messiah of the jews came to have an overwhelmingly non jewish church the answer it provides is that the message of christ was sent to the gentiles because the jews rejected it luke acts can also be seen as defense of or apology for the jesus movement addressed to the jews the bulk of the speeches and sermons in acts are addressed to jewish audiences with the romans serving as external arbiters on disputes concerning jewish customs and law on the one hand luke portrays the followers of jesus as sect of the jews and therefore entitled to legal protection as recognised religion on the other luke seems unclear as to the future god intends for jews and christians celebrating the jewishness of jesus and his immediate followers while also stressing how the jews had rejected god promised messiah composition and setting russian icon by fyodor zubov title unity of luke acts authorship and date the title acts of the apostles was first used by irenaeus in the late nd century it is not known whether this was an existing title or one invented by irenaeus it does seem clear that it was not given by the author as the word práxeis deeds acts only appears once in the text acts and there it does not refer to the apostles but refers to deeds confessed by followers to the apostles the gospel of luke and acts make up two volume work which scholars call luke acts together they account for of the new testament the largest contribution attributed to single author providing the framework for both the church liturgical calendar and the historical outline into which later generations have fitted their idea of the story of jesus and the early church the author is not named in either volume according to church tradition dating from the nd century the author was the luke named as companion of the apostle paul in three of the letters attributed to paul himself this view is still sometimes advanced but critical consensus emphasizes the countless contradictions between the account in acts and the authentic pauline letters an example can be seen by comparing acts accounts of paul conversion acts and with paul own statement that he remained unknown to christians in judea after that event galatians the author is an admirer of paul but does not share paul own view of himself as an apostle his own theology is considerably different from paul on key points and does not represent paul own views accurately he was educated man of means probably urban and someone who respected manual work although not worker himself this is significant because more high brow writers of the time looked down on the artisans and small business people who made up the early church of paul and were presumably luke audience the earliest possible date for luke acts is around ad the time of paul imprisonment in rome but most scholars date the work to ad on the grounds that it uses mark as source looks back on the destruction of jerusalem and does not show any awareness of the letters of paul which began circulating late in the first century if it does show awareness of the pauline epistles and also of the work of the jewish historian josephus as some believe then date in the early nd century is possible manuscripts there are two major textual variants of acts the western text type and the alexandrian the oldest complete alexandrian manuscripts date from the th century and the oldest western ones from the th with fragments and citations going back to the rd western texts of acts are longer than alexandrian texts the additions tending to enhance the jewish rejection of the messiah and the role of the holy spirit in ways that are stylistically different from the rest of acts the majority of scholars prefer the alexandrian shorter text type over the western as the more authentic but this same argument would favour the western over the alexandrian for the gospel of luke as in that case the western version is the shorter the debate therefore continues genre sources and historicity of acts the title acts of the apostles praxeis apostolon would seem to identify it with the genre telling of the deeds and achievements of great men praxeis but it was not the title given by the author the anonymous author aligned luke acts to the narratives διήγησις diēgēsis which many others had written and described his own work as an orderly account ἀκριβῶς καθεξῆς it lacks exact analogies in hellenistic or jewish literature the author may have taken as his model
