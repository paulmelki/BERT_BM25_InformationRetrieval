analysis is the process of breaking complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain better understanding of it the technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before aristotle though analysis as formal concept is relatively recent development the word comes from the ancient greek ἀνάλυσις analysis breaking up or an untying from ana up throughout and lysis loosening from it also comes the word plural analyses as formal concept the method has variously been ascribed to alhazen rené descartes discourse on the method and galileo galilei it has also been ascribed to isaac newton in the form of practical method of physical discovery which he did not name applications science clinical chemistry analyser hand shows size the field of chemistry uses analysis in at least three ways to identify the components of particular chemical compound qualitative analysis to identify the proportions of components in mixture quantitative analysis and to break down chemical processes and examine chemical reactions between elements of matter for an example of its use analysis of the concentration of elements is important in managing nuclear reactor so nuclear scientists will analyse neutron activation to develop discrete measurements within vast samples matrix can have considerable effect on the way chemical analysis is conducted and the quality of its results analysis can be done manually or with device chemical analysis is an important element of national security among the major world powers with materials types of analysis qualitative analysis it is concerned with which components are in given sample or compound example precipitation reaction quantitative analysis it is to determine the quantity of individual component present in given sample or compound example to find concentration by uv isotopes chemists can use isotope analysis to assist analysts with issues in anthropology archeology food chemistry forensics geology and host of other questions of physical science analysts can discern the origins of natural and man made isotopes in the study of environmental radioactivity business financial statement analysis the analysis of the accounts and the economic prospects of firm fundamental analysis stock valuation method that uses financial analysis gap analysis involves the comparison of actual performance with potential or desired performance of an organization business analysis involves identifying the needs and determining the solutions to business problems price analysis involves the breakdown of price to unit figure market analysis consists of suppliers and customers and price is determined by the interaction of supply and demand technical analysis the study of price action in securities markets in order to forecast future prices opportunity analysis consists of customers trends within the industry customer demand and experience determine purchasing behavior computer science requirements analysis encompasses those tasks that go into determining the needs or conditions to meet for new or altered product taking account of the possibly conflicting requirements of the various stakeholders such as beneficiaries or users competitive analysis online algorithm shows how online algorithms perform and demonstrates the power of randomization in algorithms lexical analysis the process of processing an input sequence of characters and producing as output sequence of symbols object oriented analysis and design la booch program analysis computer science the process of automatically analysing the behavior of computer programs semantic analysis computer science pass by compiler that adds semantical information to the parse tree and performs certain checks static code analysis the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs built from that structured systems analysis and design methodology la yourdon syntax analysis process in compilers that recognizes the structure of programming languages also known as parsing worst case execution time determines the longest time that piece of software can take to run economics agroecosystem analysis input output model if applied to region is called regional impact multiplier system engineering analysts in the field of engineering look at requirements structures mechanisms systems and dimensions electrical engineers analyse systems in electronics life cycles and system failures are broken down and studied by engineers it is also looking at different factors incorporated within the design intelligence the field of intelligence employs analysts to break down and understand wide array of questions intelligence agencies may use heuristics inductive and deductive reasoning social network analysis dynamic network analysis link analysis and brainstorming to sort through problems they face military intelligence may explore issues through the use of game theory red teaming and wargaming signals intelligence applies cryptanalysis and frequency analysis to break codes and ciphers business intelligence applies theories of competitive intelligence analysis and competitor analysis to resolve questions in the marketplace law enforcement intelligence applies number of theories in crime analysis linguistics linguistics looks at individual languages and language in general it breaks language down and analyses its component parts theory sounds and their meaning utterance usage word origins the history of words the meaning of words and word combinations sentence construction basic construction beyond the sentence level stylistics and conversation it examines the above using statistics and modeling and semantics it analyses language in context of anthropology biology evolution geography history neurology psychology and sociology it also takes the applied approach looking at individual language development and clinical issues literature literary criticism is the analysis of literature the focus can be as diverse as the analysis of homer or freud while not all literary critical methods are primarily analytical in nature the main approach to the teaching of literature in the west since the mid twentieth century literary formal analysis or close reading is this method rooted in the academic movement labelled the new criticism approaches texts chiefly short poems such as sonnets which by virtue of their small size and significant complexity lend themselves well to this type of analysis as units of discourse that can be understood in themselves without reference to biographical or historical frameworks this method of analysis breaks up the text linguistically in study of prosody the formal analysis of meter and phonic effects such as alliteration and rhyme and cognitively in examination of the interplay of
