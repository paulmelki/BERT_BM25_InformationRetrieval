in mathematics an automorphism is an isomorphism from mathematical object to itself it is in some sense symmetry of the object and way of mapping the object to itself while preserving all of its structure the set of all automorphisms of an object forms group called the automorphism group it is loosely speaking the symmetry group of the object definition in the context of abstract algebra mathematical object is an algebraic structure such as group ring or vector space an automorphism is simply bijective homomorphism of an object with itself the definition of homomorphism depends on the type of algebraic structure see for example group homomorphism ring homomorphism and linear operator the identity morphism identity mapping is called the trivial automorphism in some contexts respectively other non identity automorphisms are called nontrivial automorphisms the exact definition of an automorphism depends on the type of mathematical object in question and what precisely constitutes an isomorphism of that object the most general setting in which these words have meaning is an abstract branch of mathematics called category theory category theory deals with abstract objects and morphisms between those objects in category theory an automorphism is an endomorphism morphism from an object to itself which is also an isomorphism in the categorical sense of the word this is very abstract definition since in category theory morphisms aren necessarily functions and objects aren necessarily sets in most concrete settings however the objects will be sets with some additional structure and the morphisms will be functions preserving that structure automorphism group if the automorphisms of an object form set instead of proper class then they form group under composition of morphisms this group is called the automorphism group of closure composition of two automorphisms is another automorphism associativity it is part of the definition of category that composition of morphisms is associative identity the identity is the identity morphism from an object to itself which is an automorphism inverses by definition every isomorphism has an inverse which is also an isomorphism and since the inverse is also an endomorphism of the same object it is an automorphism the automorphism group of an object in category is denoted aut or simply aut if the category is clear from context examples in set theory an arbitrary permutation of the elements of set is an automorphism the automorphism group of is also called the symmetric group on in elementary arithmetic the set of integers considered as group under addition has unique nontrivial automorphism negation considered as ring however it has only the trivial automorphism generally speaking negation is an automorphism of any abelian group but not of ring or field group automorphism is group isomorphism from group to itself informally it is permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged for every group there is natural group homomorphism aut whose image is the group inn of inner automorphisms and whose kernel is the center of thus if has trivial center it can be embedded into its own automorphism group in linear algebra an endomorphism of vector space is linear operator an automorphism is an invertible linear operator on when the vector space is finite dimensional the automorphism group of is the same as the general linear group gl the algebraic structure of all endomorphisms of is itself an algebra over the same base field as whose invertible elements precisely consist of gl field automorphism is bijective ring homomorphism from field to itself in the cases of the rational numbers and the real numbers there are no nontrivial field automorphisms some subfields of have nontrivial field automorphisms which however do not extend to all of because they cannot preserve the property of number having square root in in the case of the complex numbers there is unique nontrivial automorphism that sends into complex conjugation but there are infinitely uncountably many wild automorphisms assuming the axiom of choice field automorphisms are important to the theory of field extensions in particular galois extensions in the case of galois extension the subgroup of all automorphisms of fixing pointwise is called the galois group of the extension the automorphism group of the quaternions as ring are the inner automorphisms by the skolem noether theorem maps of the form this group is isomorphic to so the group of rotations in dimensional space the automorphism group of the octonions is the exceptional lie group in graph theory an automorphism of graph is permutation of the nodes that preserves edges and non edges in particular if two nodes are joined by an edge so are their images under the permutation in geometry an automorphism may be called motion of the space specialized terminology is also used in metric geometry an automorphism is self isometry the automorphism group is also called the isometry group in the category of riemann surfaces an automorphism is biholomorphic map also called conformal map from surface to itself for example the automorphisms of the riemann sphere are m√∂bius transformations an automorphism of differentiable manifold is diffeomorphism from to itself the automorphism group is sometimes denoted diff in topology morphisms between topological spaces are called continuous maps and an automorphism of topological space is homeomorphism of the space to itself or self homeomorphism see homeomorphism group in this example it is not sufficient for morphism to be bijective to be an isomorphism history one of the earliest group automorphisms automorphism of group not simply group of automorphisms of points was given by the irish mathematician william rowan hamilton in in his icosian calculus where he discovered an order two automorphism writing so that is new fifth root of unity connected with the former fifth root by relations of perfect reciprocity inner and outer automorphisms in some categories notably groups rings and lie algebras it is possible to separate automorphisms into two types called inner and outer automorphisms in the case of groups the inner automorphisms are the conjugations by the elements of the group itself for each element of
