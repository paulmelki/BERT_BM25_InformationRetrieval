fire upon the deep is science fiction novel by american writer vernor vinge it is space opera involving superhuman intelligences aliens variable physics space battles love betrayal genocide and communication medium resembling usenet fire upon the deep won the hugo award in sharing it with doomsday book by connie willis besides the normal print book editions the novel was also included on cd rom sold by clarinet communications along with the other nominees for the hugo awards the cd rom edition included numerous annotations by vinge on his thoughts and intentions about different parts of the book and was later released as standalone book no longer available setting the novel is set in various locations in the milky way the galaxy is divided into four concentric volumes called the zones of thought it is not clear to the novel characters whether this is natural phenomenon or an artificially produced one but it seems to roughly correspond with galactic scale stellar density and beyond region is mentioned in the sculptor galaxy as well the zones reflect fundamental differences in basic physical laws and one of the main consequences is their effect on intelligence both biological and artificial artificial intelligence and automation is most directly affected in that advanced hardware and software from the beyond or the transcend will work less and less well as ship descends towards the unthinking depths but even biological intelligence is affected to lesser degree the four zones are spoken of in terms of low to high as follows the unthinking depths are the innermost zone surrounding the galactic core in it only minimal forms of intelligence biological or otherwise are possible this means that any ship straying into the depths will be stranded effectively permanently even if the crew did not die immediately and some forms of life native to higher zones would likely do so they would be rendered incapable of even human intelligence leaving them unable to operate their ship in any meaningful way surrounding the depths is the slow zone the earth called old earth is located in this zone and humanity is said to have originated there although earth plays no significant role in the story biological intelligence is possible in the slowness but not true sentient artificial intelligence faster than light travel may not be initiated in the slow zone one may jump into the slow zone but not back out all ships which find themselves in the slow zone are restricted to sub light speeds faster than light communication is impossible into or out of the slow zone as the boundaries of the zones are unknown and subject to change accidental entry to the slow zone is major interstellar navigational hazard at the bottom of the beyond starships which operate near the beyond slow zone border often have an auxiliary bussard ramjet drive so that if they accidentally stray into the slow zone thus disabling any ftl drive they will at least have backup sub light drive to push them back up to the beyond such ships also tend to include coldsleep equipment as it is likely that any such return will still take many subjective lifetimes for most species the next outermost layer is the beyond within which artificial intelligence faster than light travel and faster than light communication are possible few human civilizations exist in the beyond all descended from single ethnic norwegian group which managed to travel from the slow zone to the beyond presumably at sub light speeds and thence spread using ftl travel the original settlement of this group is known as nyjora other human settlements in the beyond include straumli realm and sjandra kei in the beyond ftl travel is accomplished by making many small jumps across intervening space and the efficiency of the drive increases the farther ship travels from the galactic core this reflects increases in both drive efficiency and the ship automation increased capacity as one moves outward enabling the computation of longer and longer jumps the beyond is not homogeneous zone many references are made to the high beyond or the bottom of the beyond depending on distance to the galactic core these terms seem to refer to differences in the zone itself not just relative distance from the core but there are no obvious zone boundaries within the beyond the way there are between the slow zone and the beyond or between the beyond and the transcend whereas ship that crosses from the beyond to the slow zone or vice versa will experience dramatic change in its capabilities ship in the beyond which moves farther from the core will experience gradual increase in efficiency assuming it has the technology to make use of it until another major shift at the boundary to the transcend the beyond is populated by very large number of interstellar and intergalactic civilizations which are linked by faster than light communication network the net sometimes cynically called the net of million lies the net does connect with the transcend on the off chance that one of the powers that live there deigns to communicate but has no connections with the slow zone as ftl communication is impossible into or out of that zone in the novel the net is depicted as working much like the usenet network in the early with transcripts of messages containing header and footer information as one would find in such forums the outermost layer containing the galactic halo is the transcend within which beings dwell when beyonder civilization reaches the point of technological singularity it is said to transcend becoming power such powers always seem to relocate to the transcend seemingly necessarily where they become engaged in affairs which remain entirely mysterious to those that remain in the beyond plot an expedition from straumli realm an ambitious young human civilization in the high beyond investigates five billion year old data archive in the low transcend that offers the possibility of unimaginable riches the expedition facility high lab is gradually compromised
