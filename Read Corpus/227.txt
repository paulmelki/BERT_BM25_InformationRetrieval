aristophanes bc son of philippus of the deme kydathenaion was comic playwright or comedy writer of ancient athens and poet of old attic comedy eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete these provide the most valuable examples of genre of comic drama known as old comedy and are used to define it along with fragments from dozens of lost plays by aristophanes and his contemporaries also known as the father of comedy and the prince of ancient comedy aristophanes has been said to recreate the life of ancient athens more convincingly than any other author his powers of ridicule were feared and acknowledged by influential contemporaries plato singled out aristophanes play the clouds as slander that contributed to the trial and subsequent condemning to death of socrates although other satirical playwrights had also caricatured the philosopher aristophanes second play the babylonians now lost was denounced by cleon as slander against the athenian polis it is possible that the case was argued in court but details of the trial are not recorded and aristophanes caricatured cleon mercilessly in his subsequent plays especially the knights the first of many plays that he directed himself in my opinion he says through that play chorus the author director of comedies has the hardest job of all biography theatre of dionysus athens in aristophanes time the audience probably sat on wooden benches with earth foundations less is known about aristophanes than about his plays in fact his plays are the main source of information about him and his life it was conventional in old comedy for the chorus to speak on behalf of the author during an address called the parabasis and thus some biographical facts can be found there however these facts relate almost entirely to his career as dramatist and the plays contain few clear and unambiguous clues about his personal beliefs or his private life he was comic poet in an age when it was conventional for poet to assume the role of teacher didaskalos and though this specifically referred to his training of the chorus in rehearsal it also covered his relationship with the audience as commentator on significant issues aristophanes claimed to be writing for clever and discerning audience yet he also declared that other times would judge the audience according to its reception of his plays he sometimes boasts of his originality as dramatist yet his plays consistently espouse opposition to radical new influences in athenian society he caricatured leading figures in the arts notably euripides whose influence on his own work however he once grudgingly acknowledged in politics especially the populist cleon and in philosophy religion where socrates was the most obvious target such caricatures seem to imply that aristophanes was an old fashioned conservative yet that view of him leads to contradictions it has been argued that aristophanes produced plays mainly to entertain the audience and to win prestigious competitions his plays were written for production at the great dramatic festivals of athens the lenaia and city dionysia where they were judged and awarded prizes in competition with the works of other comic dramatists an elaborate series of lotteries designed to prevent prejudice and corruption reduced the voting judges at the city dionysia to just five these judges probably reflected the mood of the audiences yet there is much uncertainty about the composition of those audiences the theatres were certainly huge with seating for at least at the theatre of dionysus the day program at the city dionysia for example was crowded with three tragedies and satyr play ahead of comedy but it is possible that many of the poorer citizens typically the main supporters of demagogues like cleon occupied the festival holiday with other pursuits the conservative views expressed in the plays might therefore reflect the attitudes of the dominant group in an audience the production process might also have influenced the views expressed in the plays throughout most of aristophanes career the chorus was essential to play success and it was recruited and funded by choregus wealthy citizen appointed to the task by one of the archons choregus could regard his personal expenditure on the chorus as civic duty and public honour but aristophanes showed in the knights that wealthy citizens might regard civic as punishment imposed on them by demagogues and populists like cleon thus the political conservatism of the plays may reflect the views of the wealthiest section of athenian society on whose generosity all dramatists depended for putting on their plays when aristophanes first play the banqueters was produced athens was an ambitious imperial power and the peloponnesian war was only in its fourth year his plays often express pride in the achievement of the older generation the victors at marathon yet they are not jingoistic and they are staunchly opposed to the war with sparta the plays are particularly scathing in criticism of war profiteers among whom populists such as cleon figure prominently by the time his last play was produced around bc athens had been defeated in war its empire had been dismantled and it had undergone transformation from being the political to the intellectual centre of greece aristophanes was part of this transformation and he shared in the intellectual fashions of the period the structure of his plays evolves from old comedy until in his last surviving play wealth ii it more closely resembles new comedy however it is uncertain whether he led or merely responded to changes in audience expectations aristophanes won second prize at the city dionysia in bc with his first play the banqueters now lost he won first prize there with his next play the babylonians also now lost it was usual for foreign dignitaries to attend the city dionysia and the babylonians caused some embarrassment for the athenian authorities since it depicted the cities of the delian league as slaves grinding at mill some influential citizens notably cleon reviled the play as slander against the polis and possibly took legal action against the
