elegant treatises and dialogues for publication only around third of his original output has survived none of it intended for publication aristotle views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship their influence extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed some of aristotle zoological observations found in his biology such as on the hectocotyl reproductive arm of the octopus were disbelieved until the th century his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic studied by medieval scholars such as peter abelard and john buridan aristotle influence on logic also continued well into the th century he influenced
