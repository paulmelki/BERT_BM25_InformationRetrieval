the akkadian empire was the first ancient empire of mesopotamia after the long lived civilization of sumer it was centered in the city of akkad and its surrounding region the empire united akkadian assyrian and babylonian and sumerian speakers under one rule the akkadian empire exercised influence across mesopotamia the levant and anatolia sending military expeditions as far south as dilmun and magan modern bahrain and oman in the arabian peninsula during the rd millennium bc there developed cultural symbiosis between the sumerians and the akkadians which included widespread bilingualism akkadian an east semitic language gradually replaced sumerian as spoken language somewhere between the rd and the nd millennia bc the exact dating being matter of debate the akkadian empire reached its political peak between the th and nd centuries bc following the conquests by its founder sargon of akkad under sargon and his successors the akkadian language was briefly imposed on neighboring conquered states such as elam and gutium akkad is sometimes regarded as the first empire in history though the meaning of this term is not precise and there are earlier sumerian claimants after the fall of the akkadian empire the people of mesopotamia eventually coalesced into two major akkadian speaking nations assyria in the north and few centuries later babylonia in the south history of research the bible refers to akkad as the great city in genesis which states the beginning of his nimrod kingdom was babel and erech and accad and calneh in the land of shinar out of that land he went forth into assyria and builded nineveh and rehoboth ir and calah and resen between nineveh and calah the same is the great city nimrod historical identity is unknown or debated but nimrod has been identified as sargon of akkad by some and others have compared him with the legendary gilgamesh founder of uruk today scholars have documented some texts from the akkadian period written in both sumerian and akkadian many later texts from the successor states of assyria and babylonia also deal with the akkadian empire understanding of the akkadian empire continues to be hampered by the fact that its capital akkad has not yet been located despite numerous attempts precise dating of archaeological sites is hindered by the fact that there are no clear distinctions between artifact assemblages thought to stem from the preceding early dynastic period and those thought to be akkadian likewise material that is thought to be akkadian continues to be in use into the ur iii period many of the more recent insights on the akkadian empire have come from excavations in the upper khabur area in modern northeastern syria which was to become part of assyria after the fall of akkad for example excavations at tell mozan ancient urkesh brought to light sealing of tar am agade previously unknown daughter of naram sin who was possibly married to an unidentified local endan ruler the excavators at nearby tell leilan ancient shekhna shubat enlil have used the results from their investigations to argue that the akkadian empire came to an end due to sudden drought the so called kiloyear event the impact of this climate event on mesopotamia in general and on the akkadian empire in particular continues to be hotly debated excavation at the modern site of tell brak has suggested that the akkadians rebuilt city brak or nagar on this site for use as an administrative center the city included two large buildings including complex with temple offices courtyard and large ovens dating and periodization the akkadian period is generally dated to either according to the middle chronology timeline of the ancient near east or according to the short chronology timeline of the ancient near east it was preceded by the early dynastic period of mesopotamia ed and succeeded by the ur iii period although both transitions are blurry for example it is likely that the rise of sargon of akkad coincided with the late ed period and that the final akkadian kings ruled simultaneously with the gutian kings alongside rulers at the city states of both uruk and lagash the akkadian period is contemporary with eb iv in israel eb iva and ej iv in syria and eb iiib in turkey timeline of rulers the relative order of akkadian kings is clear the absolute dates of their reigns are

identified on the ground it is known from various textual sources among these is at least one text predating the reign of sargon together with the fact that the name akkad is of non akkadian origin
