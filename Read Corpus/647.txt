influence on both the history of chemistry and the history of biology he is widely considered in popular literature as the father of modern chemistry it is generally accepted that lavoisier great accomplishments in chemistry stem largely from his changing the science from qualitative to quantitative one lavoisier is most noted for his discovery of the role oxygen plays in combustion he recognized and named oxygen and hydrogen and opposed the phlogiston theory lavoisier helped construct the metric system wrote the first extensive list of elements and helped to reform chemical nomenclature he predicted the existence of silicon and discovered that although matter may change its form or shape its mass always remains the same lavoisier was powerful member of number of aristocratic councils and an administrator of the ferme générale the ferme générale was one of the most hated components of the ancien régime because of the profits it took at the expense of the state the secrecy of the terms of its contracts and the violence of its armed agents all of these political and economic activities enabled him to fund his scientific research at the height of the french revolution he was charged with tax fraud and selling adulterated tobacco and was guillotined biography the collège des quatre nations in paris early life and education antoine laurent lavoisier was born to wealthy family of the nobility in paris on august the son of an attorney at the parlement of paris he inherited large fortune at the age of five upon the death of his mother lavoisier began his schooling at the collège des quatre nations university of paris also known as the collège mazarin in paris in at the age of in his last two years at the school his scientific interests were aroused and he studied chemistry botany astronomy and mathematics in the philosophy class he came under the tutelage of abbé nicolas louis de lacaille distinguished mathematician and observational astronomer who imbued the young lavoisier with an interest in meteorological observation an enthusiasm which never left him lavoisier entered the school of law where he received bachelor degree in and licentiate in lavoisier received law degree and was admitted to the bar but never practiced as lawyer however he continued his scientific education in his spare time early scientific work lavoisier education was filled with the ideals of the french enlightenment of the time and he was fascinated by pierre macquer dictionary of chemistry he attended lectures in the natural sciences lavoisier devotion and passion for chemistry were largely influenced by étienne condillac prominent french scholar of the th century his first chemical publication appeared in from to he studied geology under jean étienne guettard in collaboration with guettard lavoisier worked on geological survey of alsace lorraine in june in he read his first paper to the french academy of sciences france most elite scientific society on the chemical and physical properties of gypsum hydrated calcium sulfate and in he was awarded gold medal by the king for an essay on the problems of urban street lighting in lavoisier received provisional appointment to the academy of sciences in he worked on the first geological map of france lavoisier as social reformer lavoisier conducting an experiment on respiration

in on the hygiene in prisons and had made suggestions to improve living conditions suggestions which were largely ignored once part of the academy lavoisier also held his own competitions to push the direction of research towards bettering the public and his own work one such project he proposed in was to better public health on the insalubrious arts sponsorship of the sciences lavoisier had vision of public education having roots in scientific sociability and philanthropy lavoisier gained vast majority of his income through buying stock in the general farm which allowed him to work on science full time live comfortably and allowed him to contribute financially to better the community it would also contribute to his demise during the reign of terror many years later it was very difficult to secure public funding for the sciences at the time and additionally not very financially profitable for the average scientist so lavoisier used his wealth to open very expensive and sophisticated laboratory in france so that aspiring scientists could study without the barriers of securing funding for their research he also pushed for public education in the sciences he founded two organizations and musée des arts et
