appletalk is discontinued proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by apple inc for their macintosh computers appletalk includes number of features that allow local area networks to be connected with no prior setup or the need for centralized router or server of any sort connected appletalk equipped systems automatically assign addresses update the distributed namespace and configure any required inter networking routing appletalk was released in and was the primary protocol used by apple devices through the and versions were also released for the ibm pc and compatibles and the apple iigs appletalk support was also available in most networked printers especially laser printers some file servers and number of routers the rise of tcp ip during the led to of most of these types of support on that protocol and appletalk became unsupported as of the release of mac os in many of appletalk more advanced features have since been introduced in bonjour while universal plug and play serves similar needs history applenet after the release of the apple lisa computer in january apple invested considerable effort in the development of local area networking lan system for the machines known as applenet it was based on the seminal xerox xns protocol stack but running on custom mbit coaxial cable system rather than xerox mbit ethernet applenet was announced early in with full introduction at the target price of for plug in applenet cards for the lisa and the apple ii at that time early lan systems were just coming to market including ethernet token ring econet and arcnet this was topic of major commercial effort at the time dominating shows like the national computer conference ncc in anaheim in may all of the systems were jockeying for position in the market but even at this time ethernet widespread acceptance suggested it was to become de facto standard it was at this show that steve jobs asked gursharan sidhu seemingly innocuous question why has networking not caught on four months later in october applenet was cancelled at the time they announced that apple realized that it not in the business to create networking system we built and used applenet in house but we realized that if we had shipped it we would have seen new standards coming up in january jobs announced that they would instead be supporting ibm token ring which he expected to come out in few months applebus through this period apple was deep in development of the macintosh computer during development engineers had made the decision to use the zilog serial controller chip scc instead of the lower cost and more common uart to provide serial port connections the scc cost about more than uart but offered much higher speeds of up to kilobits per second or higher with additional hardware and internally supported number of basic networking like protocols like ibm bisync the scc was chosen because it would allow multiple devices to be attached to the port peripherals equipped with similar sccs could communicate using the built in protocols interleaving their data with other peripherals on the same bus this would eliminate the need for more ports on the back of the machine and allowed for the elimination of expansion slots for supporting more complex devices the initial concept was known as applebus envisioning system controlled by the host macintosh polling dumb devices in fashion similar to the modern universal serial bus applebus networking the macintosh team had already begun work on what would become the laserwriter and had considered number of other options to answer the question of how to share these expensive machines and other resources series of memos from bob belleville clarified these concepts outlining the mac laserwriter and file server system which would become the macintosh office by late it was clear that ibm token ring would not be ready in time for the launch of the mac and might miss the launch of these other products as well in the end token ring would not ship until october jobs earlier question to sidhu had already sparked number of ideas when applenet was cancelled in october sidhu led an effort to develop new networking system based on the applebus hardware this new system would not have to conform to any existing preconceptions and was designed to be worthy of the mac system that was user installable had zero configuration and no fixed network addresses in short true plug and play network considerable effort was needed but by the time the mac was released the basic concepts had been outlined and some of the low level protocols were on their way to completion sidhu mentioned the work to belleville only two hours after the mac was announced the new applebus was announced in early allowing direct connection from the mac or lisa through small box that plugged into the serial port and connected via cables to the next computer upstream and downstream adaptors for apple ii and apple iii were also announced apple also announced that applebus networks could be attached to and would appear to be single node within token ring system details of how this would work were sketchy appletalk just prior to its release in early applebus was renamed appletalk the system had number of limitations including speed of only kbit maximum distance of feet from end to end and only nodes per lan but as the basic hardware was built into the mac adding nodes only cost about for the adaptor box in comparison ethernet or token ring cards cost hundreds or thousands of dollars additionally the entire networking stack required only about kb of ram allowing it to run on any mac the relatively slow speed of appletalk allowed further reductions in cost instead of using rs balanced transmit and receive circuits the appletalk personal network cabling used single common electrical ground which limited speeds to about kbit but allowed one conductor to be removed this meant that common three conductor cables could be used for
