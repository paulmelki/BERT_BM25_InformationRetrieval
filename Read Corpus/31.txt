the austroasiatic languages also known as mon khmer are large language family of mainland southeast asia also scattered throughout parts of india bangladesh nepal and southern china there are around million speakers of austroasiatic languages of these languages only vietnamese khmer and mon have long established recorded history and only vietnamese and khmer have official status as modern national languages in vietnam and cambodia respectively the mon language is recognized indigenous language in myanmar and thailand in myanmar the wa language is the de facto official language of wa state santali is one of the scheduled languages of india the rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status ethnologue identifies austroasiatic languages these form thirteen established families plus perhaps shompen which is poorly attested as fourteenth which have traditionally been grouped into two as mon khmer and munda however one recent classification posits three groups munda nuclear mon khmer and khasi khmuic while another has abandoned mon khmer as taxon altogether making it synonymous with the larger family austroasiatic languages have disjunct distribution across southeast asia and parts of india bangladesh nepal and east asia separated by regions where other languages are spoken they appear to be the extant autochthonous languages of mainland southeast asia excluding the andaman islands with the neighboring kra dai hmong mien austronesian and sino tibetan languages being the result of later migrations etymology the name austroasiatic comes from combination of the latin words for south and asia hence south asia typology regarding word structure austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic sesquisyllabic pattern with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial unstressed reduced minor syllable followed by stressed full syllable this reduction of presyllables has led to variety among modern languages of phonological shapes of the same original proto austroasiatic prefixes such as the causative prefix ranging from cvc syllables to consonant clusters to single consonants as for word formation most austroasiatic languages have variety of derivational prefixes many have infixes but suffixes are almost completely non existent in most branches except munda and few specialized exceptions in other austroasiatic branches the austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register contrast either between modal normal voice and breathy lax voice or between modal voice and creaky voice languages in the pearic branch and some in the vietic branch can have three or even four way voicing contrast however some austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in few cases such as vietnamese tonogenesis vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by chinese that its original austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of south chinese languages whereas khmer which had more influence from sanskrit has retained more typically austroasiatic structure proto language much work has been done on the reconstruction of proto mon khmer in harry shorto mon khmer comparative dictionary little work has been done on the munda languages which are not well documented with their demotion from primary branch proto mon khmer becomes synonymous with proto austroasiatic paul sidwell reconstructs the consonant inventory of proto mon khmer as follows this is identical to earlier reconstructions except for is better preserved in the katuic languages which sidwell has specialized in internal classification linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of austroasiatic the mon khmer languages of southeast asia northeast india and the nicobar islands and the munda languages of east and central india and parts of bangladesh parts of nepal however no evidence for this classification has ever been published each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as valid clade by contrast the relationships between these families within austroasiatic are debated in addition to the traditional classification two recent proposals are given neither of which accepts traditional mon khmer as valid unit however little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review in addition there are suggestions that additional branches of austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of acehnese in sumatra diffloth the chamic languages of vietnam and the land dayak languages of borneo adelaar diffloth diffloth widely cited original classification

nicobarese nicobar islands peiros peiros is lexicostatistic classification based on percentages of shared vocabulary this means that languages can appear to be more distantly related than they actually are due to language contact indeed when sidwell replicated peiros study with languages known well enough to account for loans he did not find the internal branching structure below upright
