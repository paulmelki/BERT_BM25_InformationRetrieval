trial model of part of the analytical engine built by babbage as displayed at the science museum london the analytical engine was proposed mechanical general purpose computer designed by english mathematician and computer pioneer charles babbage with the assistance of ada lovelace it was first described in as the successor to babbage difference engine which was design for simpler mechanical computer the analytical engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops and integrated memory making it the first design for general purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as turing complete in other words the logical structure of the analytical engine was essentially the same as that which has dominated computer design in the electronic era the analytical engine is one of the most successful achievements of charles babbage babbage was never able to complete construction of any of his machines due to conflicts with his chief engineer and inadequate funding it was not until that the first general purpose computer was built more than century after babbage had proposed the pioneering analytical engine in design two types of punched cards used to program the machine foreground operational cards for inputting instructions background variable cards for inputting data babbage first attempt at mechanical computing device the difference engine was special purpose machine designed to tabulate logarithms and trigonometric functions by evaluating finite differences to create approximating polynomials construction of this machine was never completed babbage had conflicts with his chief engineer joseph clement and ultimately the british government withdrew its funding for the project during this project babbage realised that much more general design the analytical engine was possible the work on the design of the analytical engine started in the input consisting of programs formulae and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the jacquard loom for output the machine would have printer curve plotter and bell the machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later it employed ordinary base fixed point arithmetic there was to be store that is memory capable of holding numbers of decimal digits each ca kb an arithmetic unit the mill would be able to perform all four arithmetic operations plus comparisons and optionally square roots initially it was conceived as difference engine curved back upon itself in generally circular layout with the long store exiting off to one side later drawings depict regularised grid layout like the central processing unit cpu in modern computer the mill would rely upon its own internal procedures to be stored in the form of pegs inserted into rotating drums called barrels to carry out some of the more complex instructions the user program might specify the programming language to be employed by users was akin to modern day assembly languages loops and conditional branching were possible and so the language as conceived would have been turing complete as later defined by alan turing three different types of punch cards were used one for arithmetical operations one for numerical constants and one for load and store operations transferring numbers from the store to the arithmetical unit or back there were three separate readers for the three types of cards babbage developed some two dozen programs for the analytical engine between and and one program later these programs treat polynomials iterative formulas gaussian elimination and bernoulli numbers in the italian mathematician luigi federico menabrea published description of the engine based on lecture by babbage in french in the description was translated into english and extensively annotated by ada lovelace who had become interested in the engine eight years earlier in recognition of her additions to menabrea paper which included way to calculate bernoulli numbers using the machine widely considered to be the first complete computer program she has been described as the first computer programmer construction henry babbage analytical engine mill built in in the science museum london late in his life babbage sought ways to build simplified version of the machine and assembled small part of it before his death in in committee of the british association for the advancement of science described the analytical engine as marvel of mechanical ingenuity but recommended against constructing it the committee acknowledged the usefulness and value of the machine but could not estimate the cost of building it and were unsure whether the machine would function correctly after being built intermittently from to babbage son henry prevost babbage was constructing part of the mill and the printing apparatus in it was able to calculate faulty list of multiples of pi this constituted only small part of the whole engine it was not programmable and had no storage popular images of this section have sometimes been mislabelled implying that it was the entire mill or even the entire engine henry babbage analytical engine mill is on display at the science museum in london henry also proposed building demonstration version of the full engine with smaller storage capacity perhaps for first machine ten columns would do with fifteen wheels in each such version could manipulate numbers of digits each and what it could be told to do with those numbers could still be impressive it is only question of cards and time wrote henry babbage in and there is no reason why twenty thousand cards should not be used if necessary in an analytical engine for the purposes of the mathematician in the london science museum built complete and working specimen of babbage difference engine no design that incorporated refinements babbage discovered during the development of the analytical engine this machine was built using materials and engineering tolerances that would have been available to babbage quelling the suggestion that babbage designs could not have been produced using the manufacturing technology of his time in october john graham cumming started plan campaign to raise funds by public subscription to enable serious
