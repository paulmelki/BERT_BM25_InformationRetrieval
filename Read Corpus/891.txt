the accusative case abbreviated is linguistics term for grammatical case relating to how some languages typically mark direct object of transitive verb among those languages analogous marking principles often apply to the objects of some or all prepositions the characteristics of an accusative case often entail such as in latin what generally is termed the nominative case the english term accusative derives from the latin which in turn is translation of the greek the word may also mean causative and this may have been the greeks intention in this name but the sense of the roman translation has endured and is used in some other modern languages as the grammatical term for this case for example in russian the accusative case is typical of early indo european languages and still exists in some of them including armenian latin sanskrit greek german polish russian and serbian in the finno ugric languages such as finnish estonian and hungarian in all turkic languages and in semitic languages such as arabic balto finnic languages such as estonian and finnish have two cases to mark objects the accusative and the partitive case in morphosyntactic alignment terms both perform the accusative function but the accusative object is telic while the partitive is not modern english almost entirely lacks declension in its nouns pronouns however have an oblique case as in whom them and her which merges the accusative and dative functions and originates in old germanic dative forms see declension in english example in the sentence see the car the noun phrase the car is the direct object of the verb see in english which has mostly lost the case system the definite article and noun the car remain in the same form regardless of the grammatical role played by the words one can correctly use the car as the subject of sentence also the car is parked here in declined language the morphology of the article or noun changes in some way according to the grammatical role played by the noun in given sentence for example in german one possible translation of the car is this is the form in the nominative case used for the subject of sentence if this article noun pair is used as the object of verb it usually changes to the accusative case which entails an article shift in german see the car in german masculine nouns change their definite article from to in the accusative case latin the accusative case in latin has minor differences from the accusative case in proto indo european pie nouns in the accusative case can be used as direct object to indicate duration of time for many years ducentos annos for years this is known as the accusative of duration of time to indicate direction towards which homewards to rome with no preposition needed this is known as the accusative of place to which and is equivalent to the lative case found in some other languages as the subject of an indirect statement he said that had been cruel in later latin works such as the vulgate such construction is replaced by quod and regularly structured sentence having the subject in the nominative with case specific prepositions such as through to toward and across in exclamations such as wretched me spoken by circe to ulysses in ovid note that this is feminine the masculine form would be to indicate purpose ad profiscendum for the purpose of leaving ad effēminandōs animōs for the purpose of weakening or effeminating the spirit for the accusative endings see latin declensions german the accusative case is used for the direct object in sentence the masculine forms for german articles the an my etc change in the accusative case they always end in en the feminine neutral and plural forms do not change masculine feminine neuter plural definite article the indefinite article an for example dog is masculine word so the article changes when used in the accusative case lit have dog in the sentence dog is in the accusative case as it is the second idea the object of the sentence some german pronouns also change in the accusative case the accusative case is also used after particular german prepositions these include after which the accusative case is always used and which can govern either the accusative or the dative the latter prepositions take the accusative when motion or action is specified being done into onto the space but take the dative when location is specified being done in on that space these prepositions are also used in conjunction with certain verbs in which case it is the verb in question which governs whether the accusative or dative should be used adjective endings also change in the accusative case another factor that determines the endings of adjectives is whether the adjective is being used after definite article the after an indefinite article an or without any article before the adjective many green apples masculine feminine neuter plural definite article indefinite article no article in german the accusative case is also used for some adverbial expressions mostly temporal ones as in this evening staying at home where is marked as accusative although not direct object russian in russian accusative is used not only to display the direct object of an action but also to indicate the destination or goal of motion it is also used with some prepositions the prepositions and can both take accusative in situations where they are indicating the goal of motion in the masculine russian also distinguishes between animate and inanimate nouns with regard to the accusative only the animates carry marker in this case in fact russian almost lost the real pie accusative case since only feminine nouns ending in have distinct form other words use the genitive case in place of the accusative esperanto esperanto grammar involves only two cases nominative and an accusative the accusative is formed by the addition of to the nominative form and is the case used for direct objects
