antimony is chemical element with the symbol sb from and atomic number lustrous gray metalloid it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite sb antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics often known by the arabic name kohl metallic antimony was also known but it was erroneously identified as lead upon its discovery the earliest known description of the metal in the west was written in by vannoccio biringuccio for some time china has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds with most production coming from the xikuangshan mine in hunan the industrial methods for refining antimony are roasting and reduction with carbon or direct reduction of stibnite with iron the largest applications for metallic antimony are an alloy with lead and tin and the lead antimony plates in lead acid batteries alloys of lead and tin with antimony have improved properties for solders bullets and plain bearings antimony compounds are prominent additives for chlorine and bromine containing fire retardants found in many commercial and domestic products an emerging application is the use of antimony in characteristics properties vial containing the black allotrope of antimony oxidation products assb and gray as antimony is member of group of the periodic table one of the elements called pnictogens and has an of in accordance with periodic trends it is more electronegative than tin or bismuth and less electronegative than tellurium or arsenic antimony is stable in air at room temperature but reacts with oxygen if heated to produce antimony trioxide sb antimony is silvery lustrous gray metalloid with mohs scale hardness of which is too soft to make hard objects coins of antimony were issued in china guizhou province in but the durability was poor and the minting was soon discontinued antimony is resistant to attack by acids four allotropes of antimony are known stable metallic form and three metastable forms explosive black and yellow elemental antimony is brittle silver white shiny metalloid when slowly cooled molten antimony crystallizes in trigonal cell isomorphic with the gray allotrope of arsenic rare explosive form of antimony can be formed from the electrolysis of antimony trichloride when scratched with sharp implement an exothermic reaction occurs and white fumes are given off as metallic antimony forms when rubbed with pestle in mortar strong detonation occurs black antimony is formed upon rapid cooling of antimony vapor it has the same crystal structure as red phosphorus and black arsenic it oxidizes in air and may ignite spontaneously at it gradually transforms into the stable form the yellow allotrope of antimony is the most unstable it has only been generated by oxidation of stibine sbh at above this temperature and in ambient light this metastable allotrope transforms into the more stable black allotrope elemental antimony adopts layered structure space group rm no in which layers consist of fused ruffled six membered rings the nearest and next nearest neighbors form an irregular octahedral complex with the three atoms in each double layer slightly closer than the three atoms in the next this relatively close packing leads to high density of cm but the weak bonding between the layers leads to the low hardness and brittleness of antimony isotopes antimony has two stable isotopes sb with natural abundance of and sb with natural abundance of it also has radioisotopes of which the longest lived is sb with half life of years in addition metastable states have been characterized the most stable of these is sb with half life of days isotopes that are lighter than the stable sb tend to decay by decay and those that are heavier tend to decay by decay with some exceptions occurrence alt the abundance of antimony in the earth crust is estimated to be to parts per million comparable to thallium at parts per million and silver at ppm even though this element is not abundant it is found in more than mineral species antimony is sometimes found natively on antimony peak but more frequently it is found in the sulfide stibnite sb which is the predominant ore mineral compounds antimony compounds are often classified according to their oxidation state sb iii and sb the oxidation state is more stable oxides and hydroxides antimony trioxide is formed when antimony is burnt in air in the gas phase the molecule of the compound is but it polymerizes upon condensing antimony pentoxide can be formed only by oxidation with concentrated nitric acid antimony also forms mixed valence oxide antimony tetroxide which features both sb iii and sb unlike oxides of phosphorus and arsenic these oxides are amphoteric do not form well defined oxoacids and react with acids to form antimony salts antimonous acid is unknown but the conjugate base sodium antimonite forms upon fusing sodium oxide and transition metal antimonites are also known antimonic acid exists only as the hydrate forming salts as the antimonate anion when solution containing this anion is dehydrated the precipitate contains mixed oxides many antimony ores are sulfides including stibnite pyrargyrite zinkenite jamesonite and boulangerite antimony pentasulfide is non stoichiometric and features antimony in the oxidation state and bonds several thioantimonides are known such as and halides antimony forms two series of halides and the trihalides and are all molecular compounds having trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry the trifluoride is prepared by the reaction of with hf hf it is lewis acidic and readily accepts fluoride ions to form the complex anions and molten is weak electrical conductor the trichloride is prepared by dissolving in hydrochloric acid hcl structure of gaseous sbf the pentahalides and have trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry in the gas phase but in the liquid phase is polymeric whereas is monomeric is powerful lewis acid used to make the superacid fluoroantimonic acid sbf oxyhalides are more common for antimony than for arsenic and phosphorus antimony trioxide dissolves in concentrated acid to form oxoantimonyl compounds such as sbocl and antimonides hydrides and organoantimony compounds compounds in
