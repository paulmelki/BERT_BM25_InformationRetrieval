mathilde type asteroid measuring about across covered in craters half that size photograph taken in by the near shoemaker probe diagram of the solar system asteroid belt jo imaged by radar during its earth flyby asteroids are minor planets especially of the inner solar system larger asteroids have also been called planetoids these terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the sun that did not resolve into disc in telescope and was not observed to have characteristics of an active comet such as tail as minor planets in the outer solar system were discovered that were found to have volatile rich surfaces similar to comets these came to be distinguished from the objects found in the main asteroid belt in this article the term asteroid refers to the minor planets of the inner solar system including those co orbital with jupiter overview millions of asteroids exist many are shattered remnants of planetesimals bodies within the young sun solar nebula that never grew large enough to become planets the vast majority of known asteroids orbit within the main asteroid belt located between the orbits of mars and jupiter or are co orbital with jupiter the jupiter trojans however other orbital families exist with significant populations including the near earth objects individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic spectra with the majority falling into three main groups type type and type these were named after and are generally identified with carbon rich metallic and silicate stony compositions respectively the sizes of asteroids varies greatly the largest ceres is almost across and massive enough to qualify as dwarf planet asteroids are somewhat arbitrarily differentiated from comets and meteoroids in the case of comets the difference is one of composition while asteroids are mainly composed of mineral and rock comets are primarily composed of dust and ice furthermore asteroids formed closer to the sun preventing the development of cometary ice the difference between asteroids and meteoroids is mainly one of size meteoroids have diameter of one meter or less whereas asteroids have diameter of greater than one meter finally meteoroids can be composed of either cometary or asteroidal materials only one asteroid vesta which has relatively reflective surface is normally visible to the naked eye and this is only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned rarely small asteroids passing close to earth may be visible to the naked eye for short time the minor planet center had data on minor planets in the inner and outer solar system of which about had enough information to be given numbered designations the united nations declared june as international asteroid day to educate the public about asteroids the date of international asteroid day commemorates the anniversary of the tunguska asteroid impact over siberia russian federation on june in april the foundation reported it is percent certain we ll be hit by devastating asteroid but we re not percent sure when also in physicist stephen hawking in his final book brief answers to the big questions considered an asteroid collision to be the biggest threat to the planet in june the us national science and technology council warned that america is unprepared for an asteroid impact event and has developed and released the national near earth object preparedness strategy action plan to better prepare according to expert testimony in the united states congress in nasa would require at least five years of preparation before mission to intercept an asteroid could be launched discovery sizes of the first ten asteroids to be discovered compared to the moon ida and its moon dactyl dactyl is the first satellite of an asteroid to be discovered the first asteroid to be discovered ceres was originally considered to be new planet this was followed by the discovery of other similar bodies which with the equipment of the time appeared to be points of light like stars showing little or no planetary disc though readily distinguishable from stars due to their apparent motions this prompted the astronomer sir william herschel to propose the term asteroid coined in greek as ἀστεροειδής or asteroeidēs meaning star like star shaped and derived from the ancient greek astēr star planet in the early second half of the nineteenth century the terms asteroid and planet not always qualified as minor were still used interchangeably discovery timeline by ceres pallas juno vesta astraea in planet neptune was discovered hebe july iris august flora october metis april hygiea april tenth asteroid discovered asteroids by by by by by historical methods asteroid discovery methods have dramatically improved over the past two centuries in the last years of the th century baron franz xaver von zach organized group of astronomers to search the sky for the missing planet predicted at about au from the sun by the titius bode law partly because of the discovery by sir william herschel in of the planet uranus at the distance predicted by the law this task required that hand drawn sky charts be prepared for all stars in the zodiacal band down to an agreed upon limit of faintness on subsequent nights the sky would be charted again and any moving object would hopefully be spotted the expected motion of the missing planet was about seconds of arc per hour readily discernible by observers ceres and vesta from mars viewed by curiosity april the first object ceres was not discovered by member of the group but rather by accident in by giuseppe piazzi director of the observatory of palermo in sicily he discovered new star like object in taurus and followed the displacement of this object during several nights later that year carl friedrich gauss used these observations to calculate the orbit of this unknown object which was found to be between the planets mars and jupiter piazzi named it after ceres the roman goddess of agriculture three other asteroids pallas juno and vesta were discovered over the next few years with vesta found in after eight more years of
