apollo was the ninth crewed mission in the united states apollo program and the fourth to land on the moon it was the first mission with longer stay on the moon and greater focus on science than earlier landings apollo had the first use of the lunar roving vehicle the mission began on july and ended on august with the lunar surface exploration taking place between july and august commander david scott and lunar module pilot james irwin landed near hadley rille and explored the local area using the rover allowing them to travel further from the lunar module than had been possible on previous missions they spent hours on the moon surface on extravehicular activity eva and collected of surface material at the same time command module pilot alfred worden orbited the moon operating the sensors in the sim bay of the service module this suite of instruments collected data on the moon and its environment using panoramic camera gamma ray spectrometer mapping camera laser altimeter mass spectrometer and lunar subsatellite deployed at the end of the moonwalks the lunar module returned safely to the command module and at the end of apollo th lunar orbit the engine was fired for the journey home during the return trip worden performed the first spacewalk in deep space the apollo mission splashed down safely on august despite the loss of one of its three parachutes the mission accomplished its goals but was marred by negative publicity the following year when it emerged that the crew had carried unauthorized postal covers to the lunar surface some of which were sold by west german stamp dealer the members of the crew were reprimanded for poor judgment and did not fly in space again apollo is also remembered for the discovery of the genesis rock and for scott use of hammer and feather to validate galileo theory that absent air resistance objects drop at the same rate due to gravity background in nasa contracted for fifteen saturn rockets to achieve the apollo program goal of crewed landing on the moon by at the time no one knew how many missions this would require since success was obtained in with the sixth saturnv on apollo nine rockets remained available for hoped for total of ten landings these plans included heavier extended version of the apollo spacecraft to be used in the last five missions apollo through the revamped lunar module would be capable of up to hour stay and would carry lunar roving vehicle to the moon surface the service module would house package of orbital experiments to gather data on the moon in the original plan apollo was to be the last of the non extended missions to land in censorinus crater but in anticipation of budget cuts nasa cancelled three landing missions by september apollo became the first of three extended missions known as missions and the landing site was moved to hadley rille originally planned for apollo crew and key mission control personnel crew scott was born in in san antonio texas and had graduated from the united states military academy in serving in the air force scott had received two advanced degrees from mit in before being selected as one of the third group of astronauts the following year he flew in gemini in alongside neil armstrong and as command module pilot of apollo in worden was born in in jackson michigan and like his commander had attended west point class of and served in the air force worden earned two master degrees in engineering from the university of michigan in irwin had been born in in pittsburgh and had attended the united states naval academy graduating in and serving in the air force receiving master degree from michigan in both worden and irwin were selected in the fifth group of astronauts and apollo would be their only spaceflight gordon right and schmitt during geology training the backup crew was richard gordon jr as commander vance brand as command module pilot and harrison schmitt as lunar module pilot by the usual rotation of crews the three would most likely have flown apollo which was canceled brand flew later on the apollo soyuz test project and on sts the first operational space shuttle mission with nasa under intense pressure to send professional scientist to the moon schmitt geologist was selected as lmp of apollo instead of joe engle apollo support crew consisted of astronauts joseph allen robert parker and karl henize all three were scientist astronauts selected in as the prime crew felt they needed more assistance with the science than with the piloting none of the support crew would fly during the apollo program waiting until the space shuttle program to go into space mission control the flight directors for apollo were as follows gerry griffin gold team milton windler maroon team glynn lunney black team gene kranz white team during mission the capsule communicators capcoms always fellow astronauts were the only people who normally would speak to the crew for apollo the capcoms were allen brand gordon fullerton gordon henize edgar mitchell parker schmitt and alan shepard planning and training schmitt and other scientist astronauts advocated for greater place for science on the early apollo missions they were often met with disinterest from other astronauts or found science displaced by higher priorities schmitt realized that what was needed was an expert teacher who could fire the astronauts enthusiasm and contacted caltech geologist lee silver whom schmitt introduced to apollo commander jim lovell and to its lunar module pilot fred haise then in training for their mission lovell and haise were willing to go on field expedition with silver and geology became significant part of their training geologist farouk el baz trained the prime crew command module pilot ken mattingly to inform his planned observations from lunar orbit the crew newly acquired skills mostly went unused due to the explosion that damaged the apollo spacecraft and caused an abort of the
