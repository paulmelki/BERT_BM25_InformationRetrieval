amathus or amathous was an ancient city and one of the ancient royal cities of cyprus until about bc some of its impressive remains can be seen today on the southern coast in front of agios tychonas about west of larnaca and east of limassol its ancient cult sanctuary of aphrodite was the second most important in cyprus her homeland after paphos archaeological work has recently been continued at the site and many finds are exhibited in the limassol museum history pre history and ancient era ancient kingdoms of cyprus the pre history of amathus survives in both myth and archaeology archaeology has detected human activity from the earliest iron age bc the city legendary founder was cinyras linked with the birth of adonis who called the city after his mother amathous according to version of the ariadne legend noted by plutarch theseus abandoned ariadne at amathousa where she died giving birth to her child and was buried in sacred tomb according to plutarch source amathousians called the sacred grove where her shrine was situated the wood of aphrodite ariadne more purely hellenic myth would have amathus settled instead by one of the sons of heracles thus accounting for the fact that he was worshiped there it was said in antiquity that the people of amathus were autochthonous most likely eteocyprian or pelasgian their non greek language is confirmed on the site by eteocypriot inscriptions in the cypriot syllabary which alone in the aegean world survived the bronze age collapse and continued to be used down to the th century bc amathus was built on the coastal cliffs with natural harbour and flourished at an early date soon requiring several cemeteries greeks from euboea left their pottery at amathus from the th century bc during the post phoenician era of the th century bc palace was erected and port was also constructed which served the trade with the greeks and the levantines special burial ground for infants tophet served the culture of the phoenicians for the hellenes high on the cliff temple was built which became worship site devoted to aphrodite in her particular local presence as aphrodite amathusia along with bearded male aphrodite called aphroditos the excavators discovered the final stage of the temple of aphrodite also known as aphrodisias which dates approximately to the st century bc according to the legend it was where festive adonia took place in which athletes competed in hunting wild boars during sport competitions they also competed in dancing and singing all to the honour of adonis fish polychromic terracotta th century bce found in amathus the earliest remains hitherto found on the site are tombs of the early iron age period of graeco phoenician influences bc amathus is identified with kartihadasti phoenician new town in the cypriote tribute list of esarhaddon of assyria bc it certainly maintained strong phoenician sympathies for it was its refusal to join the philhellene league of onesilos of salamis which provoked the revolt of cyprus from achaemenid persia in bc when amathus was besieged unsuccessfully and avenged itself by the capture and execution of onesilos herodotus reports because he had besieged them the amathusians cut off onesilos head and brought it to amathous where they hung it above the gates as it hung there empty swarm of bees entered it and filled it with honeycomb when they sought advice about this event an oracle told them to take the head down and bury it and to make annual sacrifice to onesilos as hero saying that it would be better for them if they did this the amathusians did as they were told and still perform these rites in my day histories amathus was rich and densely populated kingdom with flourishing agriculture grain and sheep and copper mines situated very close to the northeast kalavasos hellenistic era about bc the philhellene evagoras of salamis was similarly opposed by amathus allied with citium and soli and even after alexander the city resisted annexation and was bound over to give hostages to seleucus its political importance was now ended but its temple of adonis and aphrodite amathusia remained famous in roman times the epithet amathusia in roman poetry often means little more than cypriote but attesting to the fame of the city from the th century bc the pedestals of two sculptures donated by the last basileus of amathous androkles representing his two sons orestheus and andragoras have survived their inscriptions are in both eteocyprian and greek languages the decline of amathus is often measured by the ptolemaic gifts to argos where amathus donated only drachmas in bc but kition and salamis gave kourion and paphos however this figure contradicts the archaeologic evidence of new buildings in this period including balneion bath gymnasium as well as fortifications of the acropolis including new tower the port of paphos appears to have lost traffic compared to amathus in the ptolemaic period an indication that paphos as the capital of the island perhaps offered fewer drachmas than the other cities for different reasons like amathus roman era in the roman era amathus became the capital of one of the four administrative regions of cyprus roman temple was built in the st century ad on top of the hellenistic predecessor the temple facilities remained so important in roman times that amathusia was used as synonym for cypriot late antiquity and the middle ages later in the th century ad amasus became the see of christian bishop and continued to flourish until the byzantine period of its bishops heliodorus was at the council of chalcedon in and alexander at the second council of nicaea in in the late th century saint ioannis eleimonas john the charitable protector of the knights of st john was born in amathus and after sent theodorus bishop of amathus to jerusalem to ransom some slaves today amathus is see of the church of cyprus and is also listed under the name amathus in cypro to distinguish it from amathus in
