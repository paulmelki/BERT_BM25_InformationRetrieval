ḥasan ibn al haytham latinized as alhazen full name was an arab mathematician astronomer and physicist of the islamic golden age referred to as the father of modern optics he made significant contributions to the principles of optics and visual perception in particular his most influential work is titled kitāb al manāẓir arabic book of optics written during which survived in latin edition polymath he also wrote on philosophy theology and medicine ibn al haytham was the first to explain that vision occurs when light reflects from an object and then passes to one eyes he was also the first to demonstrate that vision occurs in the brain rather than in the eyes building upon naturalistic empirical method pioneered by aristotle in ancient greece ibn al haytham was an early proponent of the concept that hypothesis must be supported by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical evidence an early pioneer in the scientific method five centuries before renaissance scientists born in basra he spent most of his productive period in the fatimid capital of cairo and earned his living authoring various treatises and tutoring members of the nobilities ibn al haytham is sometimes given the byname al baṣrī after his birthplace or al miṣrī of egypt al haytham was dubbed the second ptolemy by abu hasan bayhaqi and the physicist by john peckham ibn al haytham paved the way for the modern science of physical optics biography ibn al haytham alhazen was born to an arab family in basra iraq which was at the time part of the buyid emirate his initial influences were in the study of religion and service to the community at the time the society had number of conflicting views of religion that he ultimately sought to step aside from religion this led to him delving into the study of mathematics and science he held position with the title vizier in his native basra and made name for himself for his knowledge of applied mathematics as he claimed to be able to regulate the flooding of the nile he was invited to by fatimid caliph al hakim in order to realise hydraulic project at aswan however ibn al haytham was forced to concede the of his project upon his return to cairo he was given an administrative post after he proved unable to fulfill this task as well he contracted the ire of the caliph al hakim bi amr allah and is said to have been forced into hiding until the caliph death in after which his confiscated possessions were returned to him legend has it that alhazen feigned madness and was kept under house arrest during this period during this time he wrote his influential book of optics alhazen continued to live in cairo in the neighborhood of the famous university of al azhar and lived from the proceeds of his literary production until his death in copy of apollonius conics written in ibn al haytham own handwriting exists in aya sofya ms aya sofya fob dated safar among his students were sorkhab sohrab persian from semnan and abu al wafa mubashir ibn fatek an egyptian prince book of optics alhazen most famous work is his seven volume treatise on optics kitab al manazir book of optics written from to optics was translated into latin by an unknown scholar at the end of the th century or the beginning of the th century it was printed by friedrich risner in with the title opticae thesaurus alhazeni arabis libri septem nuncprimum editi eiusdem liber de crepusculis et nubium ascensionibus english treasury of optics seven books by the arab alhazen first edition by the same on twilight and the height of clouds risner is also the author of the name variant alhazen before risner he was known in the west as alhacen this work enjoyed great reputation during the middle ages works by alhazen on geometric subjects were discovered in the bibliothèque nationale in paris in by sedillot in all mark smith has accounted for full or near complete manuscripts and five fragments which are preserved in locations including one in the bodleian library at oxford and one in the library of bruges theory of optics front page of the opticae thesaurus which included the first printed latin translation of alhazen book of optics the illustration incorporates many examples of optical phenomena including perspective effects the rainbow mirrors and refraction two major theories on vision prevailed in classical antiquity the first theory the emission theory was supported by such thinkers as euclid and ptolemy who believed that sight worked by the eye emitting rays of light the second theory the intromission theory supported by aristotle and his followers had physical forms entering the eye from an object previous islamic writers such as al kindi had argued essentially on euclidean galenist or aristotelian lines the strongest influence on the book of optics was from ptolemy optics while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on galen account alhazen achievement was to come up with theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of euclid the medical tradition of galen and the intromission theories of aristotle alhazen intromission theory followed al kindi and broke with aristotle in asserting that from each point of every colored body illuminated by any light issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point this however left him with the problem of explaining how coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation in particular every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye what alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye he attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object for any one point on the eye only the ray that reached it directly without being refracted by any other part of the
