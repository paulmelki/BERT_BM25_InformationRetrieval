kimiya yi sa ādat the alchemy of happiness text on islamic philosophy and alchemy by the persian philosopher and mystic al ghazālī th century depiction of ouroboros from the alchemical treatise aurora consurgens th century zürich switzerland alchemy from arabic al kīmiyā is an ancient branch of natural philosophy philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout europe africa china and throughout asia observable in chinese text from around bce and greco roman egypt in the first few centuries ce alchemists attempted to purify mature and perfect certain materials common aims were chrysopoeia the transmutation of base metals lead into noble metals particularly gold the creation of an elixir of immortality the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease and the development of an alkahest universal solvent the perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and in the hellenistic and western mystery tradition the achievement of gnosis in europe the creation of philosopher stone was variously connected with all of these projects in english the term is often limited to descriptions of european alchemy but similar practices existed in the far east the indian subcontinent and the muslim world in europe following the th century renaissance produced by the translation of medieval islamic works on science and the rediscovery of aristotelian philosophy alchemists played significant role in early modern science particularly chemistry and medicine islamic and european alchemists developed structure of basic laboratory techniques theory terminology and experimental method some of which are still in use today however they continued antiquity belief in four elements and guarded their work in secrecy including cyphers and cryptic symbolism their work was guided by hermetic principles related to magic mythology and religion modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects despite criticisms by scholars such as holmyard and von franz that they should be understood as complementary the former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry medicine and charlatanism and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred the latter interests historians of esotericism psychologists and some philosophers and spiritualists the subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts despite this split which von franz believes has existed since the western traditions origin in mix of greek philosophy that was mixed with egyptian and mesopotamian technology numerous sources have stressed an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy as far back as pseudo democritus first century ad on physical and mystical matters although alchemy is popularly associated with magic historian lawrence principe argues that recent historical research has revealed that medieval and early modern alchemy embraced much more diverse set of ideas goals techniques and practices most readers probably are aware of several common claims about alchemy for example that it is akin to magic or that its practice then or now is essentially deceptive these ideas about alchemy emerged during the eighteenth century or after while each of them might have limited validity within narrow context none of them is an accurate depiction of alchemy in general etymology the word alchemy comes from old french alquemie alkimie used in medieval latin as alchymia this name was itself brought from the arabic word al kīmiyā or composed of two parts the late greek term khēmeía χημεία also spelled khumeia χυμεία and khēmía χημία and the arabic definite article al meaning the together this association can be interpreted as the process of transmutation by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form several etymologies have been proposed for the greek term the first was proposed by zosimos of panopolis rd th centuries who derived it from the name of book the khemeu hermanm diels argued in that it rather derived from χύμα used to describe metallic objects formed by casting others trace its roots to the egyptian name kēme hieroglyphic 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖 khmi meaning black earth which refers to the fertile and auriferous soil of the nile valley as opposed to red desert sand according to the egyptologist wallis budge the arabic word al kīmiyaʾ actually means the egyptian science borrowing from the coptic word for egypt kēme or its equivalent in the mediaeval bohairic dialect of coptic khēme this coptic word derives from demotic kmỉ itself from ancient egyptian kmt the ancient egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour black egypt was the black land by contrast with the red land the surrounding desert so this etymology could also explain the nickname egyptian black arts history alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents these traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and genetic relationships one can distinguish at least three major strands which appear to be mostly independent at least in their earlier stages chinese alchemy centered in china and indian alchemy centered on the indian subcontinent and western alchemy which occurred around the mediterranean and whose center has shifted over the millennia from greco roman egypt to the islamic world and finally medieval europe chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoism and indian alchemy with the dharmic faiths in contrast western alchemy developed its philosophical system mostly independent of but influenced by various western religions it is still an open question whether these three strands share common origin or to what extent they influenced each other hellenistic egypt zosimos from marcelin berthelot collection des anciens alchimistes grecs vol paris the start of western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and hellenistic egypt where the city of alexandria was center of alchemical knowledge and retained its pre eminence through most of the greek and roman periods following the work of andré jean festugière modern scholars see alchemical practice in the roman empire as originating from the egyptian goldsmith art greek philosophy and different religious
