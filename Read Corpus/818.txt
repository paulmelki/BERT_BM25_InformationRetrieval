acyclic aliphatic non aromatic compound butane cyclic aliphatic non aromatic compound cyclobutane in organic chemistry hydrocarbons compounds composed solely of carbon and hydrogen are divided into two classes aromatic compounds and aliphatic compounds aleiphar fat oil also known as non aromatic hydrocarbons aliphatics can be cyclic however hydrocarbons with conjugated pi systems that obey h√ºckel rule are instead considered to demonstrate aromaticity aliphatic compounds can be saturated like hexane or unsaturated like hexene and hexyne open chain compounds whether straight or branched contain no rings of any type and are thus aliphatic structure aliphatic compounds can be saturated joined by single bonds alkanes or unsaturated with double bonds alkenes or triple bonds alkynes besides hydrogen other elements can be bound to the carbon chain the most common being oxygen nitrogen sulfur and chlorine the least complex aliphatic compound is methane ch properties most aliphatic compounds are flammable allowing the use of hydrocarbons as fuel such as methane in bunsen burners and as liquefied natural gas lng and ethyne acetylene in welding examples of aliphatic compounds non aromatic the most important aliphatic compounds are iso and cyclo alk an es saturated hydrocarbons iso and cyclo alk en es and alk yn es unsaturated hydrocarbons important examples of low molecular aliphatic compounds can be found in the list below sorted by the number of carbon atoms formula name structural formula chemical classification ch methane px alkane acetylene px alkyne ethylene px alkene ethane px alkane propyne px alkyne propene px alkene propane px alkane butadiene px diene butyne px alkyne butene px alkene butane px alkane cyclohexene px cycloalkene pentane px alkane cycloheptane px cycloalkane px cyclohexane cubane px octane nonane px alkane px diene cycloalkene phellandrene px px terpene diene cycloalkene terpinene px terpene cycloalkene diene limonene px px terpene diene cycloalkene undecane px alkane squalene px terpene polyene nh polyethylene px alkane references
