anaximander anaximandros was pre socratic greek philosopher who lived in miletus city of ionia in modern day turkey he belonged to the milesian school and learned the teachings of his master thales he succeeded thales and became the second master of that school where he counted anaximenes and arguably pythagoras amongst his pupils little of his life and work is known today according to available historical documents he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies although only one fragment of his work remains fragmentary testimonies found in documents after his death provide portrait of the man anaximander was an early proponent of science and tried to observe and explain different aspects of the universe with particular interest in its origins claiming that nature is ruled by laws just like human societies and anything that disturbs the balance of nature does not last long like many thinkers of his time anaximander philosophy included contributions to many disciplines in astronomy he attempted to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the earth in physics his postulation that the indefinite or apeiron was the source of all things led greek philosophy to new level of conceptual abstraction his knowledge of geometry allowed him to introduce the gnomon in greece he created map of the world that contributed greatly to the advancement of geography he was also involved in the politics of miletus and was sent as leader to one of its colonies biography detail of raphael painting the school of athens this could be representation of anaximander leaning towards pythagoras on his left anaximander son of praxiades was born in the third year of the nd olympiad bc according to apollodorus of athens greek grammarian of the nd century bc he was sixty four years old during the second year of the th olympiad bc and died shortly afterwards establishing timeline of his work is now impossible since no document provides chronological references themistius th century byzantine rhetorician mentions that he was the first of the known greeks to publish written document on nature therefore his texts would be amongst the earliest written in prose at least in the western world by the time of plato his philosophy was almost forgotten and aristotle his successor theophrastus and few doxographers provide us with the little information that remains however we know from aristotle that thales also from miletus precedes anaximander it is debatable whether thales actually was the teacher of anaximander but there is no doubt that anaximander was influenced by thales theory that everything is derived from water one thing that is not debatable is that even the ancient greeks considered anaximander to be from the monist school which began in miletus with thales followed by anaximander and which ended with anaximenes rd century roman rhetorician aelian depicts anaximander as leader of the milesian colony to apollonia on the black sea coast and hence some have inferred that he was prominent citizen indeed various history iii explains that philosophers sometimes also dealt with political matters it is very likely that leaders of miletus sent him there as legislator to create constitution or simply to maintain the colony allegiance anaximander lived the final few years of his life as subject of the persian achaemenid empire theories anaximander theories were influenced by the greek mythical tradition and by some ideas of thales the father of philosophy as well as by observations made by older civilizations in the near east especially babylon all these were developed rationally in his desire to find some universal principle he assumed like traditional religion the existence of cosmic order and his ideas on this used the old language of myths which ascribed divine control to various spheres of reality this was common practice for the greek philosophers in society which saw gods everywhere and therefore could fit their ideas into tolerably elastic system some scholars see gap between the existing mythical and the new rational way of thought which is the main characteristic of the archaic period th to th century bc in the greek city states this has given rise to the phrase greek miracle but if we follow carefully the course of anaximander ideas we will notice that there was not such an abrupt break as initially appears the basic elements of nature water air fire earth which the first greek philosophers believed made up the universe in fact represent the primordial forces imagined in earlier ways of thinking their collision produced what the mythical tradition had called cosmic harmony in the old cosmogonies hesiod th th century bc and pherecydes th century bc zeus establishes his order in the world by destroying the powers which were threatening this harmony the titans anaximander claimed that the cosmic order is not monarchic but geometric and that this causes the equilibrium of the earth which is lying in the centre of the universe this is the projection on nature of new political order and new space organized around centre which is the static point of the system in the society as in nature in this space there is isonomy equal rights and all the forces are symmetrical and transferable the decisions are now taken by the assembly of demos in the agora which is lying in the middle of the city the same rational way of thought led him to introduce the abstract apeiron indefinite infinite boundless unlimited as an origin of the universe concept that is probably influenced by the original chaos gaping void abyss formless state from which everything else appeared in the mythical greek cosmogony it also takes notice of the mutual changes between the four elements origin then must be something else unlimited in its source that could create without experiencing decay so that genesis would never stop apeiron the refutation attributed to hippolytus of rome and the later th century byzantine philosopher simplicius of cilicia attribute to anaximander the earliest use of the word apeiron infinite or limitless to
