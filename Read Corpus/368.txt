the ak officially known as the avtomat kalashnikova also known as the kalashnikov or just ak is gas operated mm assault rifle developed in the soviet union by mikhail kalashnikov circa wwii it is the originating firearm of the kalashnikov rifle or ak family the number refers to the year it was finished design work on the ak began in it was presented for official military trials the following year and in the fixed stock version was introduced into active service with selected units of the soviet army an early development of the design was the ak skladnoy or folding which was equipped with an underfolding metal shoulder stock in early the ak was officially accepted by the soviet armed forces and used by the majority of the member states of the warsaw pact even after more than seven decades the model and its variants remain the most popular and widely used rifles in the world because of their reliability under harsh conditions low production cost compared to contemporary western weapons availability in virtually every geographic region and ease of use the ak has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as irregular forces and insurgencies worldwide the model was the basis for developing many other types of individual crew served and specialised firearms of the estimated million firearms worldwide approximately million belong to the kalashnikov family three quarters of which are ak history origins during world war ii the sturmgewehr rifle used by german forces made deep impression on their soviet counterparts the select fire rifle was chambered for new intermediate cartridge the mm kurz and combined the firepower of submachine gun with the range and accuracy of rifle on july an earlier model of the sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the people commissariat of arms of the ussr the soviets were impressed with the weapon and immediately set about developing an intermediate caliber fully automatic rifle of their own to replace the ppsh submachine guns and outdated mosin nagant bolt action rifles that armed most of the soviet army the soviets soon developed the mm cartridge the semi automatic sks carbine and the rpd light machine gun shortly after world war ii the soviets developed the ak rifle which would quickly replace the sks in soviet service introduced in the akm is lighter stamped steel version and the most ubiquitous variant of the entire ak series of firearms in the the soviets introduced the rpk light machine gun an ak type weapon with stronger receiver longer heavy barrel and bipod that would eventually replace the rpd light machine gun concept mikhail kalashnikov began his career as weapon designer in while recuperating from shoulder wound which he received during the battle of bryansk kalashnikov himself stated was in the hospital and soldier in the bed beside me asked why do our soldiers have only one rifle for two or three of our men when the germans have automatics so designed one was soldier and created machine gun for soldier it was called an avtomat kalashnikova the automatic weapon of kalashnikov ak and it carried the year of its first manufacture the ak is best described as hybrid of previous rifle technology innovations kalashnikov decided to design an automatic rifle combining the best features of the american and the german stg kalashnikov team had access to these weapons and had no need to reinvent the wheel kalashnikov himself observed lot of russian army soldiers ask me how one can become constructor and how new weaponry is designed these are very difficult questions each designer seems to have his own paths his own successes and failures but one thing is clear before attempting to create something new it is vital to have good appreciation of everything that already exists in this field myself have had many experiences confirming this to be so there are claims about kalashnikov copying other designs like bulkin tkb or simonov avs early designs kalashnikov started work on submachine gun design in and with light machine gun in early in kalashnikov was given some mm cartridges and informed that there were several designers working on weapons for this new soviet small arms cartridge it was suggested to him that this new weapon might well lead to greater things and he undertook work on the new rifle in he entered design competition with this new mm semi automatic gas operated long stroke piston carbine strongly influenced by the american garand the rifle that kalashnikov designed was in the same class as the familiar sks simonov with fixed magazine and gas tube above the barrel however this new kalashnikov design lost out to simonov design in new design competition was initiated to develop new rifle kalashnikov submitted an entry it was gas operated rifle with short stroke gas piston above the barrel breech block mechanism similar to his carbine and curved round magazine kalashnikov rifles ak with milled receiver and ak with stamped receiver proved to be reliable weapons and were accepted to second round of competition along with other designs these prototypes also known as the ak had rotary bolt two part receiver with separate trigger unit housing dual controls separate safety and fire selector switches and non reciprocating charging handle located on the left side of the weapon this design had many similarities to the stg in late as the rifles were being tested one of kalashnikov assistants aleksandr zaitsev suggested major redesign to improve reliability at first kalashnikov was reluctant given that their rifle had already fared better than its competitors eventually however zaitsev managed to persuade kalashnikov in november the new prototypes ak were completed it used long stroke gas piston above the barrel the upper and lower receivers were combined into single receiver the selector and safety were combined into single control lever dust cover on the right side of the rifle and the bolt handle was simply attached to the bolt carrier this simplified the design and
