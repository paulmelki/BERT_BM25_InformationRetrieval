american sign language asl is natural language that serves as the predominant sign language of deaf communities in the united states and most of anglophone canada besides north america dialects of asl and asl based creoles are used in many countries around the world including much of west africa and parts of southeast asia asl is also widely learned as second language serving as lingua franca asl is most closely related to french sign language lsf it has been proposed that asl is creole language of lsf although asl shows features atypical of creole languages such as agglutinative morphology asl originated in the early th century in the american school for the deaf asd in west hartford connecticut from situation of language contact since then asl use has propagated widely by schools for the deaf and deaf community organizations despite its wide use no accurate count of asl users has been taken reliable estimates for american asl users range from to persons including number of children of deaf adults asl users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of oral language to sign language asl signs have number of phonemic components such as movement of the face the torso and the hands asl is not form of pantomime although iconicity plays larger role in asl than in spoken languages english loan words are often borrowed through fingerspelling although asl grammar is unrelated to that of english asl has verbal agreement and aspectual marking and has productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers many linguists believe asl to be subject verb object svo language however there are several alternative proposals to account for asl word order classification travis dougherty explains and demonstrates the asl alphabet voice over interpretation by gilbert lensbower asl emerged as language in the american school for the deaf asd founded in which brought together old french sign language various village sign languages and home sign systems asl was created in that situation by language contact asl was influenced by its forerunners but distinct from all of them the influence of french sign language lsf on asl is readily apparent for example it has been found that about of signs in modern asl are cognate to old french sign language signs however that is far less than the standard measure used to determine whether related languages are actually dialects that suggests that nascent asl was highly affected by the other signing systems brought by the asd students although the school original director laurent clerc taught in lsf in fact clerc reported that he often learned the students signs rather than conveying lsf it has been proposed that asl is creole in which lsf is the superstrate language and the native village sign languages are substrate languages however more recent research has shown that modern asl does not share many of the structural features that characterize creole languages asl may have begun as creole and then undergone structural change over time but it is also possible that it was never creole type language there are modality specific reasons that sign languages tend towards agglutination such as the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face head torso and other body parts that might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards isolating morphology additionally clerc and thomas hopkins gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of manually coded language in instruction rather than true lsf although the united states the united kingdom and australia share english as common oral and written language asl is not mutually intelligible with either british sign language bsl or auslan all three languages show degrees of borrowing from english but that alone is not sufficient for cross language comprehension it has been found that relatively high percentage of asl signs have similar translations in auslan which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same language family however that does not seem justified historically for asl and auslan and it is likely that the resemblance is caused by the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general as well as contact with english american sign language is growing in popularity in many states many people in high school and colleges desire to take it as foreign language but until recently it was not creditable foreign language elective the issue was that many did not consider it foreign language asl users however have very distinct culture and they interact very differently when they talk their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are communicating they also have their own sentence structure which sets the language apart american sign language is now being accepted by many colleges as foreign language credit many states are making it mandatory to accept it history sign language interpreter at presentation prior to the birth of asl sign language had been used by various communities in the united states in the united states as elsewhere in the world hearing families with deaf children have historically employed ad hoc home sign which often reaches much higher levels of sophistication than gestures used by hearing people in spoken conversation as early as at first contact by francisco v√°squez de coronado there were reports that the plains indians had developed sign language to communicate between tribes of different languages in the th century triangle of village sign languages developed in new england one in martha vineyard massachusetts one in henniker new hampshire and one in sandy river valley maine martha vineyard sign language mvsl which was particularly important for the history of asl was used mainly in chilmark massachusetts due to intermarriage in the original community of english settlers of the and the recessive nature of genetic deafness chilmark had high rate of genetic deafness mvsl was used even by hearing residents whenever deaf person was present and also in some situations where spoken language would be ineffective or inappropriate such as during church sermons or between boats at sea asl is thought to have originated in the american
