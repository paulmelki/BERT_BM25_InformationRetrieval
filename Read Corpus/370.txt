the andes andes mountains or andean mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world forming continuous highland along the western edge of south america the range is long wide widest between south and south latitude and has an average height of about the andes extend from north to south through seven south american countries venezuela colombia ecuador peru bolivia chile and argentina along their length the andes are split into several ranges separated by intermediate depressions the andes are the location of several high plateaus some of which host major cities such as quito bogotá cali arequipa medellín bucaramanga sucre mérida and la paz the altiplano plateau is the world second highest after the tibetan plateau these ranges are in turn grouped into three major divisions based on climate the tropical andes the dry andes and the wet andes the andes mountains are the highest mountain range outside asia the highest mountain outside asia argentina mount aconcagua rises to an elevation of about above sea level the peak of chimborazo in the ecuadorian andes is farther from the earth center than any other location on the earth surface due to the equatorial bulge resulting from the earth rotation the world highest volcanoes are in the andes including ojos del salado on the chile argentina border which rises to the andes are also part of the american cordillera chain of mountain ranges cordillera that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western backbone of north america central america south america and antarctica cono de arita in the puna de atacama salta argentina aconcagua etymology the etymology of the word andes has been debated the majority consensus is that it derives from the quechua word which means east as in antisuyu quechua for east region one of the four regions of the inca empire the term cordillera comes from the spanish word cordel meaning rope and is used as descriptive name for several contiguous sections of the andes as well as the entire andean range and the combined mountain chain along the western part of the north and south american continents geography valle carbajal in the fuegian the andes range is about wide throughout its length except in the bolivian flexure where it is about wide the andes can be divided into three sections the southern andes in argentina and chile south of llullaillaco the central andes in peru and bolivia the northern andes in venezuela colombia and ecuador in the northern part of the andes the separate sierra nevada de santa marta range is often treated as part of the northern andes the leeward antilles islands aruba bonaire and curaçao which lie in the caribbean sea off the coast of venezuela were formerly thought to represent the submerged peaks of the extreme northern edge of the andes range but ongoing geological studies indicate that such simplification does not do justice to the complex tectonic boundary between the south american and caribbean plates geology the andes are mesozoic tertiary orogenic belt of mountains along the pacific ring of fire zone of volcanic activity that encompasses the pacific rim of the americas as well as the asia pacific region the andes are the result of tectonic plate processes caused by the subduction of oceanic crust beneath the south american plate it is the result of convergent plate boundary between the nazca plate and the south american plate the main cause of the rise of the andes is the compression of the western rim of the south american plate due to the subduction of the nazca plate and the antarctic plate to the east the andes range is bounded by several sedimentary basins such as orinoco amazon basin madre de dios and gran chaco that separate the andes from the ancient cratons in eastern south america in the south the andes share long boundary with the former patagonia terrane to the west the andes end at the pacific ocean although the peru chile trench can be considered their ultimate western limit from geographical approach the andes are considered to have their western boundaries marked by the appearance of coastal lowlands and less rugged topography the andes mountains also contain large quantities of iron ore located in many mountains within the range the andean orogen has series of bends or oroclines the bolivian orocline is seaward concave bending in the coast of south america and the andes mountains at about at this point the orientation of the andes turns from northwest in peru to south in chile and argentina the andean segment north and south of the orocline have been rotated to counter clockwise and clockwise respectively the bolivian orocline area overlaps with the area of maximum width of the altiplano plateau and according to isacks the orocline is related to crustal shortening the specific point at where the coastline bends is known as the arica elbow further south lies the maipo orocline more subtle orocline between and with seaward concave break in trend at near the southern tip of the andes lies the patagonian orocline orogeny the western rim of the south american plate has been the place of several pre andean orogenies since at least the late proterozoic and early paleozoic when several terranes and microcontinents collided and amalgamated with the ancient cratons of eastern south america by then the south american part of gondwana the formation of the modern andes began with the events of the triassic when pangaea began the break up that resulted in developing several rifts the development continued through the jurassic period it was during the cretaceous period that the andes began to take their present form by the uplifting faulting and folding of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks of the ancient cratons to the east the rise of the andes has not been constant as different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress uplift and erosion tectonic forces above the subduction zone along the entire west coast of south america
