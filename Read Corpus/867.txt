the arctic fox vulpes lagopus also known as the white fox polar fox or snow fox is small fox native to the arctic regions of the northern hemisphere and common throughout the arctic tundra biome it is well adapted to living in cold environments and is best known for its thick warm fur that is also used as camouflage it has large and very fluffy tail in the wild most individuals do not live past their first year but some exceptional ones survive up to years its body length ranges from with generally rounded body shape to minimize the escape of body heat the arctic fox preys on many small creatures such as lemmings voles ringed seal pups fish waterfowl and seabirds it also eats carrion berries seaweed and insects and other small invertebrates arctic foxes form monogamous pairs during the breeding season and they stay together to raise their young in complex underground dens occasionally other family members may assist in raising their young natural predators of the arctic fox are golden eagles polar bears wolverines red foxes wolves and grizzly bears behavior sleeping arctic fox with its fluffy tail wrapped around itself and over its face arctic foxes must endure temperature difference of up to between the external environment and their internal core temperature to prevent heat loss the arctic fox curls up tightly tucking its legs and head under its body and behind its furry tail this position gives the fox the smallest surface area to volume ratio and protects the least insulated areas arctic foxes also stay warm by getting out of the wind and residing in their dens although the arctic foxes are active year round and do not hibernate they attempt to preserve fat by reducing their locomotor activity they build up their fat reserves in the autumn sometimes increasing their body weight by more than this provides greater insulation during the winter and source of energy when food is scarce reproduction in the spring the arctic fox attention switches to reproduction and home for their potential offspring they live in large dens in frost free slightly raised ground these are complex systems of tunnels covering as much as and are often in eskers long ridges of sedimentary material deposited in formerly glaciated regions these dens may be in existence for many decades and are used by many generations of foxes pups of arctic fox with summer morph arctic foxes tend to select dens that are easily accessible with many entrances and that are clear from snow and ice making it easier to burrow in the arctic fox builds and chooses dens that face southward towards the sun which makes the den warmer arctic foxes prefer large maze like dens for predator evasion and quick escape especially when red foxes are in the area natal dens are typically found in rugged terrain which may provide more protection for the pups but the parents will also relocate litters to nearby dens to avoid predators when red foxes are not in the region arctic foxes will use dens that the red fox previously occupied shelter quality is more important to the arctic fox than the proximity of spring prey to den the main prey in the tundra is lemmings which is why the white fox is often called the lemming fox the white fox reproduction rates reflect the lemming population density which cyclically fluctuates every years when lemmings are abundant the white fox can give birth to pups but they often do not reproduce when food is scarce the coastal fox or blue fox lives in an environment where food availability is relatively consistent and they will have up to pups every year breeding usually takes place in april and may and the gestation period is about days litters may contain as many as the largest litter size in the order carnivora the young emerge from the den when to weeks old and are weaned by weeks of age arctic foxes are primarily monogamous and both parents will care for the offspring when predators and prey are abundant arctic foxes are more likely to be promiscuous exhibited in both males and females and display more complex social structures larger packs of foxes consisting of breeding or non breeding males or females can guard single territory more proficiently to increase pup survival when resources are scarce competition increases and the number of foxes in territory decreases on the coasts of svalbard the frequency of complex social structures is larger than inland foxes that remain monogamous due to food availability in scandinavia there are more complex social structures compared to other populations due to the presence of the red fox also are supplying the declining population with supplemental food one unique case however is iceland where monogamy is the most prevalent the older offspring year olds often remain within their parent territory even though predators are absent and there are fewer resources which may indicate kin selection in the fox diet an arctic fox summer morph with fish arctic foxes generally eat any small animal they can find including lemmings voles other rodents hares birds eggs fish and carrion they scavenge on carcasses left by larger predators such as wolves and polar bears and in times of scarcity also eat their feces in areas where they are present lemmings are their most common prey and family of foxes can eat dozens of lemmings each day in some locations in northern canada high seasonal abundance of migrating birds that breed in the area may provide an important food source on the coast of iceland and other islands their diet consists predominantly of birds during april and may the arctic fox also preys on ringed seal pups when the young animals are confined to snow den and are relatively helpless they also consume berries and seaweed so they may be considered omnivores this fox is significant bird egg predator consuming eggs of all except the largest tundra bird species when
