gas chromatography laboratory analytical chemistry studies and uses instruments and methods used to separate identify and quantify matter in practice separation identification or quantification may constitute the entire analysis or be combined with another method separation isolates analytes qualitative analysis identifies analytes while quantitative analysis determines the numerical amount or concentration analytical chemistry consists of classical wet chemical methods and modern instrumental methods classical qualitative methods use separations such as precipitation extraction and distillation identification may be based on differences in color odor melting point boiling point radioactivity or reactivity classical quantitative analysis uses mass or volume changes to quantify amount instrumental methods may be used to separate samples using chromatography electrophoresis or field flow fractionation then qualitative and quantitative analysis can be performed often with the same instrument and may use light interaction heat interaction electric fields or magnetic fields often the same instrument can separate identify and quantify an analyte analytical chemistry is also focused on improvements in experimental design chemometrics and the creation of new measurement tools analytical chemistry has broad applications to medicine science and engineering history gustav kirchhoff left and robert bunsen right analytical chemistry has been important since the early days of chemistry providing methods for determining which elements and chemicals are present in the object in question during this period significant contributions to analytical chemistry include the development of systematic elemental analysis by justus von liebig and systematized organic analysis based on the specific reactions of functional groups the first instrumental analysis was flame emissive spectrometry developed by robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff who discovered rubidium rb and caesium cs in most of the major developments in analytical chemistry take place after during this period instrumental analysis becomes progressively dominant in the field in particular many of the basic spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques were discovered in the early th century and refined in the late th century the separation sciences follow similar time line of development and also become increasingly transformed into high performance instruments in the many of these techniques began to be used together as hybrid techniques to achieve complete of samples starting in approximately the into the present day analytical chemistry has progressively become more inclusive of biological questions bioanalytical chemistry whereas it had previously been largely focused on inorganic or small organic molecules lasers have been increasingly used in chemistry as probes and even to initiate and influence wide variety of reactions the late th century also saw an expansion of the application of analytical chemistry from somewhat academic chemical questions to forensic environmental industrial and medical questions such as in histology modern analytical chemistry is dominated by instrumental analysis many analytical chemists focus on single type of instrument academics tend to either focus on new applications and discoveries or on new methods of analysis the discovery of chemical present in blood that increases the risk of cancer would be discovery that an analytical chemist might be involved in an effort to develop new method might involve the use of tunable laser to increase the specificity and sensitivity of spectrometric method many methods once developed are kept purposely static so that data can be compared over long periods of time this is particularly true in industrial quality assurance qa forensic and environmental applications analytical chemistry plays an increasingly important role in the pharmaceutical industry where aside from qa it is used in discovery of new drug candidates and in clinical applications where understanding the interactions between the drug and the patient are critical classical methods the presence of copper in this qualitative analysis is indicated by the bluish green color of the flame although modern analytical chemistry is dominated by sophisticated instrumentation the roots of analytical chemistry and some of the principles used in modern instruments are from traditional techniques many of which are still used today these techniques also tend to form the backbone of most undergraduate analytical chemistry educational labs qualitative analysis qualitative analysis determines the presence or absence of particular compound but not the mass or concentration by definition qualitative analyses do not measure quantity chemical tests there are numerous qualitative chemical tests for example the acid test for gold and the kastle meyer test for the presence of blood flame test inorganic qualitative analysis generally refers to systematic scheme to confirm the presence of certain aqueous ions or elements by performing series of reactions that eliminate ranges of possibilities and then confirms suspected ions with confirming test sometimes small carbon containing ions are included in such schemes with modern instrumentation these tests are rarely used but can be useful for educational purposes and in field work or other situations where access to state of the art instruments are not available or expedient quantitative analysis quantitative analysis is the measurement of the quantities of particular chemical constituents present in substance gravimetric analysis gravimetric analysis involves determining the amount of material present by weighing the sample before and or after some transformation common example used in undergraduate education is the determination of the amount of water in hydrate by heating the sample to remove the water such that the difference in weight is due to the loss of water volumetric analysis titration involves the addition of reactant to solution being analyzed until some equivalence point is reached often the amount of material in the solution being analyzed may be determined most familiar to those who have taken chemistry during secondary education is the acid base titration involving color changing indicator there are many other types of titrations for example potentiometric titrations these titrations may use different types of indicators to reach some equivalence point instrumental methods block diagram of an analytical instrument showing the stimulus and measurement of response spectroscopy spectroscopy measures the interaction of the molecules with electromagnetic radiation spectroscopy consists of many different applications such as atomic absorption spectroscopy atomic emission spectroscopy ultraviolet visible spectroscopy ray spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy raman spectroscopy dual polarization interferometry nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy photoemission spectroscopy m√∂ssbauer spectroscopy and
