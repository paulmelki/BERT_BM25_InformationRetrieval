in mathematics field is algebraically closed if every non constant polynomial in the univariate polynomial ring with coefficients in has root in examples as an example the field of real numbers is not algebraically closed because the polynomial equation has no solution in real numbers even though all its coefficients and are real the same argument proves that no subfield of the real field is algebraically closed in particular the field of rational numbers is not algebraically closed also no finite field is algebraically closed because if an are the elements of then the polynomial has no zero in by contrast the fundamental theorem of algebra states that the field of complex numbers is algebraically closed another example of an algebraically closed field is the field of complex algebraic numbers equivalent properties given field the assertion is algebraically closed is equivalent to other assertions the only irreducible polynomials are those of degree one the field is algebraically closed if and only if the only irreducible polynomials in the polynomial ring are those of degree one the assertion the polynomials of degree one are irreducible is trivially true for any field if is algebraically closed and is an irreducible polynomial of then it has some root and therefore is multiple of since is irreducible this means that for some on the other hand if is not algebraically closed then there is some non constant polynomial in without roots in let be some irreducible factor of since has no roots in also has no roots in therefore has degree greater than one since every first degree polynomial has one root in every polynomial is product of first degree polynomials the field is algebraically closed if and only if every polynomial of degree with coefficients in splits into linear factors in other words there are elements xn of the field such that xn if has this property then clearly every non constant polynomial in has some root in in other words is algebraically closed on the other hand that the property stated here holds for if is algebraically closed follows from the previous property together with the fact that for any field any polynomial in can be written as product of irreducible polynomials polynomials of prime degree have roots if every polynomial over of prime degree has root in then every non constant polynomial has root in it follows that field is algebraically closed if and only if every polynomial over of prime degree has root in the field has no proper algebraic extension the field is algebraically closed if and only if it has no proper algebraic extension if has no proper algebraic extension let be some irreducible polynomial in then the quotient of modulo the ideal generated by is an algebraic extension of whose degree is equal to the degree of since it is not proper extension its degree is and therefore the degree of is on the other hand if has some proper algebraic extension then the minimal polynomial of an element in is irreducible and its degree is greater than the field has no proper finite extension the field is algebraically closed if and only if it has no proper finite extension because if within the previous proof the term algebraic extension is replaced by the term finite extension then the proof is still valid note that finite extensions are necessarily algebraic every endomorphism of fn has some eigenvector the field is algebraically closed if and only if for each natural number every linear map from fn into itself has some eigenvector an endomorphism of fn has an eigenvector if and only if its characteristic polynomial has some root therefore when is algebraically closed every endomorphism of fn has some eigenvector on the other hand if every endomorphism of fn has an eigenvector let be an element of dividing by its leading coefficient we get another polynomial which has roots if and only if has roots but if xn then is the characteristic polynomial of the companion matrix decomposition of rational expressions the field is algebraically closed if and only if every rational function in one variable with coefficients in can be written as the sum of polynomial function with rational functions of the form where is natural number and and are elements of if is algebraically closed then since the irreducible polynomials in are all of degree the property stated above holds by the theorem on partial fraction decomposition on the other hand suppose that the property stated above holds for the field let be an irreducible element in then the rational function can be written as the sum of polynomial function with rational functions of the form therefore the rational expression can be written as quotient of two polynomials in which the denominator is product of first degree polynomials since is irreducible it must divide this product and therefore it must also be first degree polynomial relatively prime polynomials and roots for any field if two polynomials are relatively prime then they do not have common root for if was common root then and would both be multiples of and therefore they would not be relatively prime the fields for which the reverse implication holds that is the fields such that whenever two polynomials have no common root then they are relatively prime are precisely the algebraically closed fields if the field is algebraically closed let and be two polynomials which are not relatively prime and let be their greatest common divisor then since is not constant it will have some root which will be then common root of and if is not algebraically closed let be polynomial whose degree is at least without roots then and are not relatively prime but they have no common roots since none of them has roots other properties if is an algebraically closed field and is natural number then contains all th roots of unity because these are by definition the not necessarily distinct zeroes of the polynomial xn
