archers in east timor japanese archer archery in bhutan archery is the art sport practice or skill of using bow to shoot arrows the word comes from the latin arcus for bow historically archery has been used for hunting and combat in modern times it is mainly competitive sport and recreational activity person who participates in archery is typically called an archer or bowman and person who is fond of or an expert at archery is sometimes called toxophilite or marksman history the oldest known evidence of arrows comes from the south african site of sibudu cave where the remains of bone and stone arrowheads have been found dating approximately years ago based on indirect evidence the bow also seems to have appeared or reappeared later in eurasia near the transition from the upper paleolithic to the mesolithic the earliest definite remains of bow and arrow from europe are possible fragments from germany found at mannheim vogelstang dated years ago and at stellmoor dated years ago azilian points found in grotte du bichon switzerland alongside the remains of both bear and hunter with flint fragments found in the bear third vertebra suggest the use of arrows at years ago other signs of its use in europe come from the in the north of hamburg germany and dates from the late paleolithic about bc the arrows were made of pine and consisted of main shaft and fore shaft with flint point there are no definite earlier bows previous pointed shafts are known but may have been launched by spear throwers rather than bows the oldest bows known so far comes from the holmegård swamp in denmark at the site of nataruk in turkana county kenya obsidian bladelets found embedded in skull and within the thoracic cavity of another skeleton suggest the use of stone tipped arrows as weapons about years ago bows eventually replaced the spear thrower as the predominant means for launching shafted projectiles on every continent except australasia though spear throwers persisted alongside the bow in parts of the americas notably mexico and among the inuit bows and arrows have been present in egyptian and neighboring nubian culture since its respective predynastic and pre kerma origins in the levant artifacts that could be arrow shaft straighteners are known from the natufian culture bc onwards the khiamian and ppn shouldered khiam points may well be arrowheads classical civilizations notably the assyrians greeks armenians persians parthians romans indians koreans chinese and japanese fielded large numbers of archers in their armies akkadians were the first to use composite bows in war according to the victory stele of naram sin of akkad egyptians referred to nubia as ta seti or the land of the bow since the nubians were known to be expert archers and by the th century bc egyptians were using the composite bow in warfare the bronze age aegean cultures were able to deploy number of state owned specialized bow makers for warfare and hunting purposes already from the th century bc the welsh longbow proved its worth for the first time in continental warfare at the battle of crécy in the americas archery was widespread at european contact archery was highly developed in asia the sanskrit term for archery dhanurveda came to refer to martial arts in general in east asia goguryeo one of the three kingdoms of korea was well known for its regiments of exceptionally skilled archers mounted archery maximilian engraved by dürer central tribesmen of asia after the domestication of the horse and american plains indians after gaining access to horses by europeans became extremely adept at archery on horseback lightly armored but highly mobile archers were excellently suited to warfare in the central asian steppes and they formed large part of armies that repeatedly conquered large areas of eurasia shorter bows are more suited to use on horseback and the composite bow enabled mounted archers to use powerful weapons empires throughout the eurasian landmass often strongly associated their respective barbarian counterparts with the usage of the bow and arrow to the point where powerful states like the han dynasty referred to their neighbors the xiong nu as those who draw the bow for example xiong nu mounted bowmen made them more than match for the han military and their threat was at least partially responsible for chinese expansion into the ordos region to create stronger more powerful buffer zone against them it is possible that barbarian peoples were responsible for introducing archery or certain types of bows to their civilized counterparts the xiong nu and the han being one example similarly short bows seem to have been introduced to japan by northeast asian groups decline of archery the development of firearms rendered bows obsolete in warfare although efforts were sometimes made to preserve archery practice in england and wales for example the government tried to enforce practice with the longbow until the end of the th century this was because it was recognized that the bow had been instrumental to military success during the hundred years war despite the high social status ongoing utility and widespread pleasure of archery in armenia china egypt england and wales america india japan korea turkey and elsewhere almost every culture that gained access to even early firearms used them widely to the neglect of archery early firearms were inferior in rate of fire and were very sensitive to wet weather however they had longer effective range and were tactically superior in the common situation of soldiers shooting at each other from behind obstructions they also required significantly less training to use properly in particular penetrating steel armor without any need to develop special musculature armies equipped with guns could thus provide superior firepower and highly trained archers became obsolete on the battlefield however the bow and arrow is still an effective weapon
