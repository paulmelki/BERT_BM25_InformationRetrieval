arabic calligraphy allah is the arabic word for god in abrahamic religions in the english language the word generally refers to god in islam the word is thought to be derived by contraction from al ilāh which means the god and is linguistically related to el elohim and elah the hebrew and aramaic words for god the word allah has been used by arabic people of different religions since pre islamic times more specifically it has been used as term for god by muslims both arab and non arab and arab christians it is also often albeit not exclusively used in this way by bábists baháʼís mandaeans indonesian and maltese christians and mizrahi jews similar usage by christians and sikhs in west malaysia has recently led to political and legal controversies etymology the arabic components that build up the word allah the etymology of the word allāh has been discussed extensively by classical arab philologists grammarians of the basra school regarded it as either formed spontaneously murtajal or as the definite form of lāh from the verbal root lyh with the meaning of lofty or hidden others held that it was borrowed from syriac or hebrew but most considered it to be derived from contraction of the arabic definite article al the and deity god to meaning the deity or the god the majority of modern scholars subscribe to the latter theory and view the loanword hypothesis with skepticism cognates of the name allāh exist in other semitic languages including hebrew and aramaic the corresponding aramaic form is elah but its emphatic state is elaha it is written as ʼĕlāhā in biblical aramaic and ʼalâhâ in syriac as used by the assyrian church both meaning simply god biblical hebrew mostly uses the plural but functional singular form elohim but more rarely it also uses the singular form eloah usage pre islamic arabians regional variants of the word allah occur in both pagan and christian pre islamic inscriptions different theories have been proposed regarding the role of allah in pre islamic polytheistic cults some authors have suggested that polytheistic arabs used the name as reference to creator god or supreme deity of their pantheon the term may have been vague in the meccan religion according to one hypothesis which goes back to julius wellhausen allah the supreme deity of the tribal federation around quraysh was designation that consecrated the superiority of hubal the supreme deity of quraysh over the other gods however there is also evidence that allah and hubal were two distinct deities according to that hypothesis the kaaba was first consecrated to supreme deity named allah and then hosted the pantheon of quraysh after their conquest of mecca about century before the time of muhammad some inscriptions seem to indicate the use of allah as name of polytheist deity centuries earlier but nothing precise is known about this use some scholars have suggested that allah may have represented remote creator god who was gradually eclipsed by more particularized local deities there is disagreement on whether allah played major role in the meccan religious cult no iconic representation of allah is known to have existed allah is the only god in mecca that did not have an idol muhammad father name was meaning the slave of allāh christianity arabic speakers of all abrahamic faiths including christians and jews use the word allah to mean god the christian arabs of today have no other word for god than allah similarly the aramaic word for god in the language of assyrian christians is ʼĕlāhā or alaha even the arabic descended maltese language of malta whose population is almost entirely catholic uses alla for god arab christians for example use the terms for god the father for god the son and for god the holy spirit see god in christianity for the christian concept of god arab christians have used two forms of invocations that were affixed to the beginning of their written works they adopted the muslim and also created their own trinitized as early as the th century the muslim reads in the name of god the compassionate the merciful the trinitized reads in the name of father and the son and the holy spirit one god the syriac latin and greek invocations do not have the words one god at the end this addition was made to emphasize the monotheistic aspect of trinitarian belief and also to make it more palatable to muslims according to marshall hodgson it seems that in the pre islamic times some arab christians made pilgrimage to the kaaba pagan temple at that time honoring allah there as god the creator some archaeological excavation quests have led to the discovery of ancient pre islamic inscriptions and tombs made by arab christians in the ruins of church at umm el jimal in northern jordan which initially according to enno littman contained references to allah as the proper name of god however on second revision by bellamy et al the versed inscription was re translated as this inscription was
