history origins throughout the th century bc athens sought to consolidate its control over thrace which was strategically important because of its primary materials the gold and silver of the pangaion hills and the dense forests essential for naval construction and the sea routes vital for athens supply of grain from scythia after first unsuccessful attempt at colonisation in bc by the milesian tyrant histiaeus the athenians founded first colony at ennea hodoi nine ways in bc but these first ten thousand colonists were massacred by the thracians second attempt took place in bc on the same site under the guidance of hagnon son of nicias which was successful the city and its first walls date from this time map of amphipolis amphipolis location map the new settlement took the name of amphipolis literally around the city name which is the subject of much debate about its etymology thucydides claims the name comes from the fact that the strymon river flows around the city on two sides however note in the suda also given in the lexicon of photius offers different explanation apparently given by marsyas son of periander that large proportion of the population lived around the city however more probable explanation is the one given by julius pollux that the name indicates the vicinity of an isthmus amphipolis became the main power base of the athenians in thrace and consequently target of choice for their spartan adversaries the athenian population remained very much in the minority in the city for this reason amphipolis remained an independent city and an ally of the athenians rather than colony or member of the athens led delian league however in bc the spartan general brasidas easily took control of the city rescue expedition led by the athenian general and later historian thucydides had to settle for securing eion and could not retake amphipolis failure for which thucydides was sentenced to exile new athenian force under the command of cleon failed once more in bc during the battle of amphipolis at which both cleon and brasidas lost their lives brasidas survived long enough to hear of the defeat of the athenians and was buried at amphipolis with impressive pomp from then on he was regarded as the founder of the city and honoured with yearly games and sacrifices macedonian rule fortifications and bridge of amphipolis the lion of amphipolis the city itself kept its independence until the reign of king philip ii despite several athenian attacks notably because of the government of callistratus of aphidnae in bc philip succeeded where the athenians had failed and conquered the city thereby removing the obstacle which amphipolis presented to macedonian control over thrace according to the historian theopompus this conquest came to be the object of secret accord between athens and philip ii who would return the city in exchange for the fortified town of pydna but the macedonian king betrayed the accord refusing to cede amphipolis and laying siege to pydna as well the city was not immediately incorporated into the macedonian kingdom and for some time preserved its institutions and certain degree of autonomy the border of macedonia was not moved further east however philip sent number of macedonian governors to amphipolis and in many respects the city was effectively macedonianized nomenclature the calendar and the currency the gold stater created by philip to capitalise on the gold reserves of the pangaion hills replaced the amphipolitan drachma were all replaced by macedonian equivalents in the reign of alexander the great amphipolis was an important naval base and the birthplace of three of the most famous macedonian admirals nearchus androsthenes and laomedon whose burial place is most likely marked by the famous lion of amphipolis the importance of the city in this period is shown by alexander the great decision that it was one of the six cities at which large luxurious temples costing talents were built alexander prepared for campaigns here against thrace in bc and his army and fleet assembled near the port before the invasion of asia the port was also used as naval base during his campaigns in asia after alexander death his wife roxana and their young son alexander iv were exiled by cassander and later murdered here throughout macedonian sovereignty amphipolis was strong fortress of great strategic and economic importance as shown by inscriptions amphipolis became one of the main stops on the macedonian royal road as testified by border stone found between philippi and amphipolis giving the distance to the latter and later on the via egnatia the principal roman road which crossed the southern balkans apart from the ramparts of the lower town the gymnasium and set of well preserved frescoes from wealthy villa are the only artifacts from this period that remain visible though little is known of the layout of the town modern knowledge of its institutions is in considerably better shape thanks to rich epigraphic documentation including military ordinance of philip and an ephebarchic law from the gymnasium conquest by the romans after
