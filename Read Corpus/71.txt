the aardwolf proteles cristata is an insectivorous mammal native to east and southern africa its name means earth wolf in afrikaans and dutch it is also called maanhaar jackal afrikaans for mane jackal gÄ«b by the nama people ant hyena termite eating hyena and civet hyena based on its habit of secreting substances from its anal gland characteristic shared with the african civet the aardwolf is in the same family as the hyena unlike many of its relatives in the order carnivora the aardwolf does not hunt large animals it eats insects and their larvae mainly termites one aardwolf can lap up as many as termites during single night using its long sticky tongue the aardwolves tongue has adapted to be tough enough to withstand the strong bite of termites the aardwolf lives in the shrublands of eastern and southern africa open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs it is nocturnal resting in burrows during the day and emerging at night to seek food taxonomy the aardwolf is generally classified with the hyena family hyaenidae though it was formerly placed in its own family protelidae early on scientists felt that it was merely mimicking the striped hyena which subsequently led to the creation of protelidae recent studies have suggested that the aardwolf probably diverged from other hyaenids early on how early is still unclear as the fossil record and genetic studies disagree by million years the aardwolf is the only surviving species in the subfamily protelinae there is disagreement as to whether the species is monotypic or can be divided into subspecies cristatus of southern africa and septentrionalis of east africa etymology the generic name proteles comes from two words both of greek origin protos and teleos which combined means complete in front based on the fact that they have five toes on their front feet and four on the rear the specific name cristatus comes from latin and means provided with comb relating to their mane physical characteristics detail of head taken at the cincinnati zoo skeleton of an aardwolf displayed at museum of osteology the aardwolf resembles very thin striped hyena but with more slender muzzle black vertical stripes on coat of yellowish fur and long distinct mane down the midline of the neck and back it also has one or two diagonal stripes down the fore and hind quarters along with several stripes on its legs the mane is raised during confrontations to make the aardwolf appear larger it is missing the throat spot that others in the family have its lower leg from the knee down is all black and its tail is bushy with black tip aardwolf skull the aardwolf is about long excluding its bushy tail which is about long and stands about tall at the shoulders an adult aardwolf weighs approximately sometimes reaching the aardwolves in the south of the continent tend to be smaller about than the eastern version around this makes the aardwolf the smallest extant member of the hyaenidae family the front feet have five toes each unlike the four toed hyena the teeth and skull are similar to those of other hyenas though smaller and its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects it does still have canines but unlike other hyenas these teeth are used primarily for fighting and defense its ears which are large are very similar to those of the striped hyena as an aardwolf ages it will normally lose some of its teeth though this has little impact on its feeding habits due to the softness of the insects that it eats distribution and habitat aardwolves live in open dry plains and bushland avoiding mountainous areas due to their specific food requirements they are only found in regions where termites of the family hodotermitidae occur termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed grasslands and savannahs including farmland for most of the year aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to dozen dens which are occupied for six weeks at time there are two distinct populations one in southern africa and another in east and northeast africa the species does not occur in the intermediary miombo forests an adult pair along with their most recent offspring occupies territory of behavior san antonio zoo aardwolves are shy and nocturnal sleeping in burrows by day they will on occasion during the winter become diurnal feeders this happens during the coldest periods as they then stay in at night to conserve heat they have often been mistaken for solitary animals in fact they live as monogamous pairs with their young if their territory is infringed upon they will chase the intruder up to or to the border if the intruder is caught which rarely happens fight will occur which is accompanied by soft clucking hoarse barking and type of roar the majority of incursions occur during mating season when they can occur once or twice per week when food is scarce the stringent territorial system may be abandoned and as many as three pairs may occupy single territory the territory is marked by both sexes as they both have developed anal glands from which they extrude black substance that is smeared on rocks or grass stalks in long streaks aardwolves also have scent glands on the forefoot and penile pad they often mark near termite mounds within their territory every minutes or so if they are patrolling their territorial boundaries the marking frequency increases drastically to once every at this rate an individual may mark marks per hour and upwards of per night an aardwolf pair may have up to dens and numerous feces middens within their territory when they deposit excreta at their middens they dig small hole and cover it with sand their dens are usually abandoned aardvark springhare or porcupine dens or on occasion they are crevices in rocks they will also dig their own dens or enlarge dens started by springhares they
