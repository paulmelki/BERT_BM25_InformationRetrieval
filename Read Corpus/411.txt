vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in venice mantua and vienna after meeting the emperor charles vi vivaldi moved to vienna hoping for royal support however the emperor died soon after vivaldi arrival and vivaldi himself died in poverty less than year later his music remains widely popular in the present day and is regularly played the world over life childhood church where vivaldi was given the supplemental baptismal rites san giovanni in bragora sestiere di castello venice antonio lucio vivaldi was born on march in venice then the capital of the venetian republic he was baptized immediately after his birth at his home by the midwife which led to belief that his life was somehow in danger though the reasons for the child immediate baptism are not known for certain it was done most likely due either to his poor health or to an earthquake that shook the city that day in the trauma of the earthquake vivaldi mother may have dedicated him to the priesthood the ceremonies which had been omitted were supplied two months later vivaldi parents were giovanni battista vivaldi and camilla calicchio as recorded in the register of san giovanni in bragora vivaldi had five known siblings bonaventura tomaso vivaldi margarita gabriela vivaldi cecilia maria vivaldi francesco gaetano vivaldi and zanetta anna vivaldi giovanni battista who was barber before becoming professional violinist taught antonio to play the violin and then toured venice playing the violin with his young son antonio was probably taught at an early age judging by the extensive musical knowledge he had acquired by the age of when he started working at the ospedale della pietà giovanni battista was one of the founders of the sovvegno dei musicisti di santa cecilia an association of musicians the president of the sovvegno was giovanni legrenzi an early baroque composer and the maestro di cappella at st mark basilica it is possible that legrenzi gave the young antonio his first lessons in composition the german scholar walter kolneder has discerned the influence of legrenzi style in vivaldi early liturgical work laetatus sum rv anh written in at the age of thirteen vivaldi father may have been composer himself in an opera titled la fedeltà sfortunata was composed by giovanni battista rossi the name under which vivaldi father had joined the sovvegno di santa cecilia vivaldi health was problematic one of his symptoms strettezza di petto tightness of the chest has been interpreted as form of asthma this did not prevent him from learning to play the violin composing or taking part in musical activities although it did stop him from playing wind instruments in at the age of fifteen he began studying to become priest he was ordained in aged and was soon nicknamed il prete rosso the red priest rosso is italian for red and would have referred to the color of his hair family trait not long after his ordination in he was given dispensation from celebrating mass most likely because of his ill health vivaldi said mass as priest only few times and appeared to have withdrawn from liturgical duties though he remained member of the priesthood it is thought that this is also due to his habit of composing while performing mass he seems to have remained committed to catholicism since the entry in the vienna death records for him reads antonio vivaldi secular priest it is thought that he remained devout catholic indeed in the protestant composer ernst ludwig gerber wrote of the aged vivaldi that the rosary never left his hand except when he picked up the pen to write an opera at the ospedale della pietà in september vivaldi became maestro di violino master of violin at an orphanage called the pio ospedale della pietà devout hospital of mercy in venice while vivaldi is most famous as composer he was regarded as an exceptional technical violinist as well the german architect johann friedrich armand von uffenbach referred to vivaldi as the famous composer and violinist and said that vivaldi played solo accompaniment excellently and at the conclusion he added free fantasy an improvised cadenza which absolutely astounded me for it is hardly possible that anyone has ever played or ever will play in such fashion commemorative plaque beside the ospedale della pietà vivaldi was only when he started working at the orphanage over the next thirty years he composed most of his major works while working there there were four similar institutions in venice their purpose was to give shelter and education to children who were abandoned or orphaned or whose families could not support them they were financed by funds provided by the republic the boys learned trade and had to leave when they reached the age of fifteen the girls received musical education and the most talented among them stayed and became members of the ospedale renowned orchestra and choir shortly after vivaldi appointment the orphans began to gain appreciation and esteem abroad too vivaldi wrote concertos
