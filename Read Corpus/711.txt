apus is small constellation in the southern sky it represents bird of paradise and its name means without feet in greek because the bird of paradise was once wrongly believed to lack feet first depicted on celestial globe by petrus plancius in it was charted on star atlas by johann bayer in his uranometria the french explorer and astronomer nicolas louis de lacaille charted and gave the brighter stars their bayer designations in the five brightest stars are all reddish in hue shading the others at apparent magnitude is alpha apodis an orange giant that has around times the diameter and times the luminosity of the sun marginally fainter is gamma apodis another ageing giant star delta apodis is double star the two components of which are arcseconds apart and visible with the naked eye two star systems have been found to have planets history detail of johann bayer uranometria showing the constellations apus chamaeleon musca as apis the bee and triangulum australe as well as the south celestial pole alt black line drawing on faded brownish paper depicting stylized bird with no feet and triangle superimposed on some stars apus was one of twelve constellations published by petrus plancius from the observations of pieter dirkszoon keyser and frederick de houtman who had sailed on the first dutch trading expedition known as the eerste schipvaart to the east indies it first appeared on cm in diameter celestial globe published in in amsterdam by plancius with jodocus hondius de houtman included it in his southern star catalogue in under the dutch name de paradijs voghel the bird of paradise and plancius called the constellation paradysvogel apis indica the first word is dutch for bird of paradise apis latin for bee is assumed to have been typographical error for avis bird after its introduction on plancius globe the constellation first known appearance in celestial atlas was in german cartographer johann bayer uranometria of bayer called it apis indica while fellow astronomers johannes kepler and his son in law jakob bartsch called it apus or avis indica the name apus is derived from the greek apous meaning without feet this referred to the western misconception that the bird of paradise had no feet which arose because the only specimens available in the west had their feet and wings removed such specimens began to arrive in europe in when the survivors of ferdinand magellan expedition brought them home the constellation later lost some of its tail when nicolas louis de lacaille used those stars to establish octans in the characteristics covering square degrees and hence of the sky apus ranks th of the modern constellations by area its position in the southern celestial hemisphere means that the whole constellation is visible to observers south of it is bordered by ara triangulum australe and circinus to the north musca and chamaeleon to the west octans to the south and pavo to the east the three letter abbreviation for the constellation as adopted by the international astronomical union in is aps the official constellation boundaries as set by belgian astronomer eugène delporte in are defined by polygon of six segments illustrated in infobox in the equatorial coordinate system the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and while the declination coordinates are between and features stars lacaille gave twelve stars bayer designations labelling them alpha through to kappa including two stars next to each other as delta and another two stars near each other as kappa within the constellation borders there are stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude beta gamma and delta apodis form narrow triangle with alpha apodis lying to the east the five brightest stars are all red tinged which is unusual among constellations alpha apodis is an orange giant of spectral type iii located light years away from earth with an apparent magnitude of it spent much of its life as blue white type main sequence star before expanding cooling and brightening as it used up its core hydrogen it has swollen to times the sun diameter and shines with luminosity approximately times that of the sun with surface temperature of beta apodis is an orange giant light years away with magnitude of it is around times as massive as the sun with surface temperature of gamma apodis is yellow giant of spectral type iii located light years away with magnitude of it is approximately times as luminous the sun with surface temperature of delta apodis is double star the two components of which are arcseconds apart and visible through binoculars delta is red giant star of spectral type iii located light years away it is semiregular variable that varies from magnitude to with pulsations of multiple periods of and days delta is an orange giant star of spectral type iii located light years away with magnitude of the separate components can be resolved with the naked eye the fifth brightest star is zeta apodis at magnitude star that has swollen and cooled to become an orange giant of spectral type iii with surface temperature of and luminosity times that of the sun it is light years distant near zeta is iota apodis binary star system light years distant that is composed of two blue white main sequence stars that orbit each other every years of spectral types and they are both over three times as massive as the sun eta apodis is white main sequence star located light years distant of apparent magnitude it is times as massive times as luminous as the sun and has times its radius aged million years old this star is emitting an excess of μm infrared radiation which may be caused by debris disk of dust orbiting at distance of more than astronomical units from it theta apodis is cool red giant of spectral type iii located light years distant it shines with luminosity approximately times that of the sun and has surface temperature of semiregular variable it varies by magnitudes with period
