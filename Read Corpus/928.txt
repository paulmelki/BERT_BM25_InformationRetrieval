the first individual alkaloid morphine was isolated in from the opium poppy papaver somniferum alkaloids are class of basic naturally occurring organic compounds that contain at least one nitrogen atom this group also includes some related compounds with neutral and even weakly acidic properties some synthetic compounds of similar structure may also be termed alkaloids in addition to carbon hydrogen and nitrogen alkaloids may also contain oxygen sulfur and more rarely other elements such as chlorine bromine and phosphorus alkaloids are produced by large variety of organisms including bacteria fungi plants and animals they can be purified from crude extracts of these organisms by acid base extraction or solvent extractions followed by silica gel column chromatography alkaloids have wide range of pharmacological activities including antimalarial quinine antiasthma ephedrine anticancer cholinomimetic galantamine vasodilatory vincamine antiarrhythmic quinidine analgesic morphine antibacterial chelerythrine and activities piperine many have found use in traditional or modern medicine or as starting points for drug discovery other alkaloids possess psychotropic psilocin and stimulant activities cocaine caffeine nicotine theobromine and have been used in entheogenic rituals or as recreational drugs alkaloids can be toxic too atropine tubocurarine although alkaloids act on diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals they almost uniformly evoke bitter taste the boundary between alkaloids and other nitrogen containing natural compounds is not clear cut compounds like amino acid peptides proteins nucleotides nucleic acid amines and antibiotics are usually not called alkaloids natural compounds containing nitrogen in the exocyclic position mescaline serotonin dopamine etc are usually classified as amines rather than as alkaloids some authors however consider alkaloids special case of amines naming the article that introduced the concept of alkaloid the name alkaloids was introduced in by the german chemist carl friedrich wilhelm meißner and is derived from late latin root which in turn comes from the arabic meaning ashes of plants and the suffix like however the term came into wide use only after the publication of review article by oscar jacobsen in the chemical dictionary of albert ladenburg in the there is no unique method for naming alkaloids many individual names are formed by adding the suffix ine to the species or genus name for example atropine is isolated from the plant atropa belladonna strychnine is obtained from the seed of the strychnine tree strychnos nux vomica where several alkaloids are extracted from one plant their names are often distinguished by variations in the suffix idine anine aline inine etc there are also at least alkaloids whose names contain the root vin because they are extracted from vinca plants such as vinca rosea catharanthus roseus these are called vinca alkaloids history friedrich sertürner the german chemist who first isolated morphine from opium alkaloid containing plants have been used by humans since ancient times for therapeutic and recreational purposes for example medicinal plants have been known in mesopotamia from about bc the odyssey of homer referred to gift given to helen by the egyptian queen drug bringing oblivion it is believed that the gift was an opium containing drug chinese book on houseplants written in st rd centuries bc mentioned medical use of ephedra and opium poppies also coca leaves have been used by south american indians since ancient times extracts from plants containing toxic alkaloids such as aconitine and tubocurarine were used since antiquity for poisoning arrows studies of alkaloids began in the th century in the german chemist friedrich sertürner isolated from opium soporific principle which he called morphium referring to morpheus the greek god of dreams in german and some other central european languages this is still the name of the drug the term morphine used in english and french was given by the french physicist joseph louis gay lussac significant contribution to the chemistry of alkaloids in the early years of its development was made by the french researchers pierre joseph pelletier and joseph bienaimé caventou who discovered quinine and strychnine several other alkaloids were discovered around that time including xanthine atropine caffeine coniine nicotine colchicine sparteine and cocaine the development of the chemistry of alkaloids was accelerated by the emergence of spectroscopic and chromatographic methods in the th century so that by more than alkaloids had been identified the first complete synthesis of an alkaloid was achieved in by the german chemist albert ladenburg he produced coniine by reacting methylpyridine with acetaldehyde and reducing the resulting propenyl pyridine with sodium bufotenin an alkaloid from some toads contains an indole core and is produced in living organisms from the amino acid tryptophan classifications the nicotine molecule contains both pyridine left and pyrrolidine rings right compared with most other classes of natural compounds alkaloids are characterized by great structural diversity there is no uniform classification initially when knowledge of chemical structures was lacking botanical classification of the source plants was relied on this classification is now considered obsolete more recent classifications are based on similarity of the carbon skeleton indole isoquinoline and pyridine like or biochemical precursor ornithine lysine tyrosine tryptophan etc however they require compromises in borderline cases for example nicotine contains pyridine fragment from nicotinamide and pyrrolidine part from ornithine and therefore can be assigned to both classes alkaloids are often divided into the following major groups true alkaloids contain nitrogen in the heterocycle and originate from amino acids their characteristic examples are atropine nicotine and morphine this group also includes some alkaloids that besides the nitrogen heterocycle contain terpene evonine or peptide fragments ergotamine the piperidine alkaloids coniine and coniceine may be regarded as true alkaloids rather than pseudoalkaloids see below although they do not originate from amino acids protoalkaloids which contain nitrogen but not the nitrogen heterocycle and also originate from amino acids examples include mescaline adrenaline and ephedrine polyamine alkaloids derivatives of putrescine spermidine and spermine peptide and cyclopeptide alkaloids pseudoalkaloids alkaloid like compounds that do not originate from amino acids this group includes terpene like and steroid like alkaloids as well as purine like alkaloids such as caffeine theobromine theacrine and theophylline some
