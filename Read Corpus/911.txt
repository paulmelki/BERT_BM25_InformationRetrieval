president george bush nominated clarence thomas federal circuit judge to succeed retiring associate supreme court justice thurgood marshall senate hearings on his confirmation were initially completed with thomas good character being presented as primary qualification for the high court because he had only been judge for slightly more than one year there had been little organized opposition to thomas nomination and his confirmation seemed assured until report of private interview of hill by the fbi was leaked to the press the hearings were then reopened and hill was called to publicly testify hill said on october in televised hearings that thomas had sexually harassed her while he was her supervisor at the department of education and the eeoc when questioned on why she followed thomas to the second job after he had already allegedly harassed her she said working in reputable position within the civil rights field had been her ambition the position was appealing enough to inhibit her from going back into private practice with her previous firm she said that she only realized later in her life that the choice had represented poor judgment on her part but that at that time it appeared that the sexual overtures had ended according to hill thomas asked her out socially many times during her two years of employment as his assistant and after she declined his requests he used work situations to discuss sexual subjects he spoke about such matters as women having sex with animals and films showing group sex or rape scenes she said adding that on several occasions thomas graphically described his own sexual prowess and the details of his anatomy hill also recounted an instance in which thomas examined can of coke on his desk and asked who has put pubic hair on my coke during the hearing republican senator orrin hatch implied that hill was working in tandem with slick lawyers and interest groups bent on destroying thomas chances to join the court thomas said he had considered hill friend whom he had helped at every turn so when accusations of harassment came from her they were particularly hurtful and he said lost the belief that if did my best all would work out four female witnesses reportedly waited in the wings to support hill credibility but they were not called due to what the los angeles times described as private compromise deal between republicans and the senate judiciary committee chair democrat joe biden hill agreed to take polygraph test while senators and other authorities noted that polygraph results cannot be relied upon and are inadmissible in courts hill results did support her statements thomas did not take polygraph test he made vehement and complete denial saying that he was being subjected to high tech lynching for uppity blacks by white liberals who were seeking to block black conservative from taking seat on the supreme court after extensive debate the united states senate confirmed thomas to the supreme court by vote of the narrowest margin since the th century thomas supporters questioned hill credibility claiming she was delusional or had been spurned leading her to seek revenge they cited the time delay of ten years between the alleged behavior by thomas and hill accusations and noted that hill had followed thomas to second job and later had personal contacts with thomas including giving him ride to an airport behavior which they said would be inexplicable if hill allegations were true hill countered that she had come forward because she felt an obligation to share information on the character and actions of person who was being considered for the supreme court she testified that after leaving the eeoc she had had two inconsequential phone conversations with thomas and had seen him personally on two occasions once to get job reference and the second time when he made public appearance in oklahoma where she was teaching doubts about the veracity of hill testimony persisted long after thomas took his seat on the court they were furthered by american spectator writer david brock in his book the real anita hill though he later recanted the claims he had made described in his book as character assassination and apologized to hill after interviewing number of women who
