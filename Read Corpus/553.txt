through manifestis probatum afonso died in and was succeeded by his son sancho youth afonso was the son of teresa the illegitimate daughter of king alfonso vi of león and castile and her husband henry of burgundy according to fernão lopes crónica de portugal de the future portuguese king was born in guimarães which was at the time the most important political center of his parents this was accepted by most portuguese scholarship until in torquato de sousa soares proposed coimbra the center of the county of coimbra and another political center of afonso progenitors as his birthplace which caused outrage in guimarães and polemic between this historian and josé hermano saraiva almeida fernandes later proposed viseu as the birthplace of afonso basing himself on the chronica gothorum which states afonso was born in position followed by josé mattoso in his biography of the king abel estefânio has suggested different date and thesis proposing as the birth date and the region of tierra de campos or even sahagún as likely birth places based on the known itineraries of counts henry and teresa henry and teresa reigned jointly as count and countess of portugal until his death on may during the siege of astorga after which teresa ruled portugal alone she would proclaim herself queen claim recognised by pope paschal ii in but was captured and forced to reaffirm her vassalage to her half sister urraca of león it is not known who was the tutor of afonso later traditions probably started with joão soares coelho bastard descendant of egas moniz through female line in the mid th century and ampliated by later chronicles such as the crónica de portugal de asserted he had been egas moniz de ribadouro possibly with the help of oral memories that associated the tutor to the house of ribadouro yet contemporary documents namely from the chancery of afonso in his early years as count of portucale indicate according to the historian josé mattoso that the most likely tutor of afonso henriques was egas moniz oldest brother ermígio moniz who besides being the senior brother within the family of ribadouro became the dapifer and majordomus of afonso from until his death in which indicates his closer proximity to the prince in an effort to pursue larger share in the leonese inheritance his mother teresa joined forces with fernando pérez de trava the most powerful count in galicia the portuguese nobility disliked the alliance between galicia and portugal and rallied around afonso the archbishop of braga was also concerned with the dominance of galicia apprehensive of the ecclesiastical pretensions of his new rival the galician archbishop of santiago de compostela diego gelmírez who had claimed an alleged discovery of relics of saint james in his town as way to gain power and riches over the other cathedrals in the iberian peninsula in order to stop her son alfonso from overthrowing her teresa exiled him when he was twelve in the year in afonso turned fourteen the adult age in the th century in symmetry with his cousin alfonso made himself knight on his own account in the cathedral of zamora in after the military campaign of alfonso vii against his mother in afonso revolted against her and proceeded to take control of the county from its queen sole count in near guimarães at the battle of são mamede afonso and his supporters overcame troops under both his mother and her lover count fernando peres de trava of galicia afonso exiled his mother to galicia and took over rule of the county of portucale thus the possibility of re incorporating portucale into kingdom of portugal and galicia as before was eliminated and afonso became sole ruler following demands for greater independence from the county church and nobles the battle was mostly ignored by the leonese suzerain who was occupied at the time with revolt in castille he was also most likely waiting for the reaction of the galician families after teresa death in afonso vii of león and castille proceeded to demand vassalage from his cousin on april afonso henriques dictated the writ in which he proclaimed himself prince of portugal or prince of the portuguese an act informally allowed by afonso vii as it was thought to be afonso henriques right by blood as one of two grandsons of the emperor of hispania afonso then turned his arms against the persistent problem of the moors in the south his campaigns were successful and on july he obtained an overwhelming victory in the battle of ourique and straight after was possibly unanimously proclaimed king of the portuguese by his soldiers establishing his equality in rank to the other realms of the peninsula although the first reference to his royal title dates from the first assembly of the portuguese cortes convened
