argon is chemical element with the symbol ar and atomic number it is in group of the periodic table and is noble gas argon is the third most abundant gas in the earth atmosphere at ppmv it is more than twice as abundant as water vapor which averages about ppmv but varies greatly times as abundant as carbon dioxide ppmv and more than times as abundant as neon ppmv argon is the most abundant noble gas in earth crust comprising of the crust nearly all of the argon in the earth atmosphere is radiogenic argon derived from the decay of potassium in the earth crust in the universe argon is by far the most common argon isotope as it is the most easily produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in supernovas the name argon is derived from the greek word neuter singular form of meaning lazy or inactive as reference to the fact that the element undergoes almost no chemical reactions the complete octet eight electrons in the outer atomic shell makes argon stable and resistant to bonding with other elements its triple point temperature of is defining fixed point in the international temperature scale of argon is produced industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air argon is mostly used as an inert shielding gas in welding and other high temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive for example an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning argon is also used in incandescent fluorescent lighting and other gas discharge tubes argon makes distinctive blue green gas laser argon is also used in fluorescent glow starters characteristics small piece of rapidly melting solid argon argon has approximately the same solubility in water as oxygen and is times more soluble in water than nitrogen argon is colorless odorless nonflammable and nontoxic as solid liquid or gas argon is chemically inert under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature although argon is noble gas it can form some compounds under various extreme conditions argon fluorohydride harf compound of argon with fluorine and hydrogen that is stable below has been demonstrated although the neutral ground state chemical compounds of argon are presently limited to harf argon can form clathrates with water when atoms of argon are trapped in lattice of water molecules ions such as and excited state complexes such as arf have been demonstrated theoretical calculation predicts several more argon compounds that should be stable but have not yet been synthesized history test tube dilute alkali shaped glass tube platinum electrode argon greek neuter singular form of meaning lazy or inactive is named in reference to its chemical inactivity this chemical property of this first noble gas to be discovered impressed the namers an unreactive gas was suspected to be component of air by henry cavendish in argon was first isolated from air in by lord rayleigh and sir william ramsay at university college london by removing oxygen carbon dioxide water and nitrogen from sample of clean air they first accomplished this by replicating an experiment of henry cavendish they trapped mixture of atmospheric air with additional oxygen in test tube upside down over large quantity of dilute alkali solution which in canvendish original experiment was potassium hydroxide and conveyed current through wires insulated by shaped glass tubes cc which sealed around the platinum wire electrodes leaving the ends of the wires dd exposed to the gas and insulated from the alkali solution the arc was powered by battery of five grove cells and ruhmkorff coil of medium size the alkali absorbed the oxides of nitrogen produced by the arc and also carbon dioxide they operated the arc until no more reduction of volume of the gas could be seen for at least an hour or two and the spectral lines of nitrogen disappeared when the gas was examined the remaining oxygen was reacted with alkaline pyrogallate to leave behind an apparently non reactive gas which they called argon before isolating the gas they had determined that nitrogen produced from chemical compounds was lighter than nitrogen from the atmosphere the difference was slight but it was important enough to attract their attention for many months they concluded that there was another gas in the air mixed in with the nitrogen argon was also encountered in through independent research of newall and hartley each observed new lines in the emission spectrum of air that did not match known elements until the symbol for argon was but now it is ar occurrence argon constitutes by volume and by mass of the earth atmosphere and air is the primary industrial source of purified argon products argon is isolated from air by fractionation most commonly by cryogenic fractional distillation process that also produces purified nitrogen oxygen neon krypton and xenon the earth crust and seawater contain ppm and ppm of argon respectively isotopes the main isotopes of argon found on earth are and naturally occurring with half life of years decays to stable by electron capture or positron emission and also to stable by beta decay these properties and ratios are used to determine the age of rocks by ar dating in the earth atmosphere is made by cosmic ray activity primarily by neutron capture of followed by two neutron emission in the subsurface environment it is also produced through neutron capture by followed by proton emission is created from the neutron capture by followed by an alpha particle emission as result of subsurface nuclear explosions it has half life of days between locations in the solar system the isotopic composition of argon varies greatly where the major source of argon is the decay of in rocks will be the dominant isotope as it is on earth argon produced directly by stellar nucleosynthesis is dominated by the alpha process nuclide correspondingly solar argon contains according to solar wind measurements and the ratio of the three isotopes ar ar ar in the atmospheres of the outer
