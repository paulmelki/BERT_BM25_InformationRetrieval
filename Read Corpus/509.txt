alexander medieval gaelic alaxandair mac maíl coluim modern gaelic alasdair mac mhaol chaluim april posthumously nicknamed the fierce was the king of scotland from to his death he succeeded his brother king edgar and his successor was his brother david he was married to the illegitimate child of henry of england sybilla of normandy life alexander was the fifth some sources say fourth son of malcolm iii by his wife margaret of wessex grandniece of edward the confessor alexander was named after pope alexander ii he was the younger brother of king edgar who was unmarried and his brother heir presumptive by and perhaps earlier in that year he was the senior layman present at the examination of the remains of saint cuthbert at durham prior to their re interment he held lands in scotland north of the forth and in lothian on the death of edgar in alexander succeeded to the scottish crown but in accordance with edgar instructions their brother david was granted an appanage in southern scotland edgar will granted david the lands of the former kingdom of strathclyde or cumbria and this was apparently agreed in advance by edgar alexander david and their brother in law henry of england in perhaps at henry instigation and with the support of his anglo norman allies david demanded and received additional lands in lothian along the upper tweed and teviot david did not receive the title of king but of prince of the cumbrians and his lands remained under alexander final authority the dispute over tweeddale and teviotdale does not appear to have damaged relations between alexander and david although it was unpopular in some quarters gaelic poem laments it bad what malcolm son has done dividing us from alexander he causes like each king son before the plunder of stable alba the dispute over the eastern marches does not appear to have caused lasting trouble between alexander and henry of england in he joined henry on campaign in wales against gruffudd ap cynan of gwynedd alexander marriage with henry illegitimate daughter sybilla of normandy may have occurred as early as or as at late as william of malmesbury account attacks sybilla but the evidence argues that alexander and sybilla were devoted but childless couple and sybilla was of noteworthy piety sybilla died in unrecorded circumstances at eilean nam ban kenmore on loch tay in july and was buried at dunfermline abbey alexander did not remarry and walter bower wrote that he planned an augustinian priory at the eilean nam ban dedicated to sybilla memory and he may have taken steps to have her venerated alexander had at least one illegitimate child máel coluim mac alaxandair who was later involved in revolt against david in the he was imprisoned at roxburgh for many years afterwards perhaps until his death some time after alexander was like his brothers edgar and david notably pious king he was responsible for foundations at scone and inchcolm the latter founded in thanks for his survival of tempest at sea nearby his mother chaplain and hagiographer thurgot was named bishop of saint andrews or cell rígmonaid in presumably by alexander order the case of thurgot would be successor eadmer shows that alexander wishes were not always accepted by the religious community perhaps because eadmer had the backing of the archbishop of canterbury ralph escures rather than thurstan of york alexander also patronised saint andrews granting lands intended for an augustinian priory which may have been the same as that intended to honour his wife for all his religiosity alexander was not remembered as man of peace john of fordun says of him he manifested the terrible aspect of his character in his reprisals in the mormaerdom of moray andrew of wyntoun orygynale cronykil of scotland says that alexander was holding court at invergowrie when he was attacked by men of the isles walter bower says the attackers were from moray and mearns alexander pursued them north to stockford in ross near beauly where he defeated them this says wyntoun is why he was named the fierce the dating of this is uncertain as are his enemies identity however in the annals of
