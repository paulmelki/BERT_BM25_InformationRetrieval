antipope felix an archdeacon of rome was installed as pope in ad after the emperor constantius ii banished the reigning pope liberius for refusing to subscribe to sentence of condemnation against saint athanasius biography in may ad the roman laity which had remained faithful to liberius demanded that constantius who was on visit to rome should recall liberius the emperor planned to have felix and liberius rule jointly but when liberius returned felix was forced to retire to porto near rome where after making an unsuccessful attempt to establish himself again in rome he died on november ad this felix was later confused with roman martyr named felix with the result that he was included in lists of the popes as felix ii and that the succeeding popes of the same name pope felix iii and pope felix iv were given wrong numerals as was antipope felix the catholic encyclopedia called this confusion distortion of the true facts and suggested that it arose because the liber pontificalis which at this point may be registering reliable tradition says that this felix built church on the via aurelia which is where the roman martyr of an earlier date was buried however more recent source says that of the martyr felix nothing is known except his name that he was martyr and that he was buried in the cemetery on the via portuensis that bears his name the catholic encyclopedia remarked that the real story of the antipope was lost and he obtained in local roman history the status of saint and confessor as such he appears in the roman martyrology on july at that time the roman martyrology had the following text this entry was based on what the catholic encyclopedia called later legends that confound the relative positions of felix and liberius more recent editions of the roman martyrology have instead the feast day of the roman martyr felix is july the antipope felix died as stated above on november and his death was not martyr occurring when the peace of constantine had been in force for half century as well as the roman martyrology the roman missal identified the saint felix of july with the antipope this identification still found in the typical edition does not appear in the typical edition to judge by the marietti printing of which omits the numeral ii and the word papae the correction had already been made by then one catholic writer excuses this by saying that the antipope himself did refuse to accept arianism and so his feast has been kept in the past on july see also papal selection before references external links the papal schism between liberius and felix primary source encyclop√¶dia britannica felix ii
