alexios doukas december in latinised spelling alexius ducas was byzantine emperor from february to april just prior to the sack of constantinople by the participants of the fourth crusade his family name was doukas but he was also known by the nickname mourtzouphlos or murtzuphlus referring to either bushy overhanging eyebrows or sullen gloomy character he achieved power through palace coup killing his predecessors in the process though he made vigorous attempts to defend constantinople from the crusader army his military efforts proved ineffective his actions won the support of the mass of the populace but he alienated the elite of the city following the fall sack and occupation of the city alexios was blinded by another ex emperor and later executed by the new latin regime he was the last byzantine emperor to rule in constantinople until the byzantine recapture of constantinople in origins and character though in possession of the surname used by leading byzantine aristocratic family there is very little definitely known concerning the ancestry of alexios doukas mourtzouphlos the noble doukas clan were not the only doukai as the surname was also employed by many families of humble origins it has been claimed that alexios doukas was great great grandson of the emperor alexios komnenos in the female line cognatic descent this is not improbable as all other byzantine emperors and the majority of attempted usurpers of the period had connection with the former imperial house of the komnenoi either by descent or marriage more precise theory has been proposed that he was the son of an isaac doukas and was the second cousin of alexios iv angelos letter sent to pope innocent iii stated that alexios doukas mourtzouphlos was blood relation of alexios iv angelos the contemporary historian niketas choniates was dismissed from office as logothete of the sekreta by mourtzouphlos his assessment of the emperor character might therefore be biased however choniates allows that he was extremely clever by nature though arrogant in his manner and lecherous political intrigues and usurpation the siege of constantinople in by palma il giovane the participation of alexios doukas mourtzouphlos in the attempted overthrow of alexios iii angelos by john komnenos the fat in had led to his imprisonment mourtzouphlos was probably imprisoned from until the restoration to the throne of isaac ii angelos the brother and predecessor of alexios iii isaac ii along with his son alexios iv angelos were restored to the throne through the intervention of the leaders of the fourth crusade in july on release mourtzouphlos was invested with the court position of protovestiarios head of the imperial finances he had been married twice but was allegedly the lover of eudokia angelina daughter of alexios iii by the beginning of isaac ii and alexios iv had inspired little confidence among the people of constantinople with their efforts to protect the city from the latin crusaders and their venetian allies and the citizens were becoming restless the crusaders were also losing patience with the emperors they rioted and set fires in the city when the money and aid promised by alexios iv was not forthcoming the fires affected about sixth of the area of constantinople and may have made up to third of the population homeless the dislocation and desperation of those affected eventually sapped the will of the people to resist the crusaders alexios doukas mourtzouphlos emerged as leader of the anti latin movement in the city he won the approval of the populace by his valour in leading an attack on the latins at trypetos lithos in this clash his mount stumbled and he would have been killed or captured had band of youthful archers from the city not defended him mourtzouphlos exploited the hatred of the people for the latins to serve his personal ambition the citizens of constantinople rebelled in late january and in the chaos an otherwise obscure nobleman named nicholas kanabos was acclaimed emperor though he was unwilling to accept the crown the two co emperors barricaded themselves in the palace of blachernae and entrusted mourtzouphlos with mission to seek help from the crusaders or at least they informed him of their intentions instead of contacting the crusaders mourtzouphlos on the night of january used his access to the palace to bribe the ax bearers the varangian guard and with their backing arrest the emperors choniates states that mourtzouphlos when bribing the guards had the help of eunuch with access to the imperial treasury the support of the varangians seems to have been of major importance in the success of the coup though mourtzouphlos also had help from his relations and associates the young alexios iv was eventually strangled in prison while his father isaac both enfeebled and blind died at around the time of the coup his death variously attributed to fright sorrow or mistreatment kanabos was initially spared and offered an office under alexios but he refused both this and further summons from the emperor and took sanctuary in the hagia sophia he was forcibly removed and killed on the steps of the cathedral emperor alexios negotiating with doge enrico dandolo by gustave dor√© the timing of the deaths of the deposed emperors and of kanabos and their relation to the coronation of alexios are problematic alexios appears to have been acclaimed emperor as early as the night he moved against the angeloi co emperors hendrickx and matzukis suggest that alexios assumed the imperial insignia immediately but was crowned later possibly on february finding the treasury empty the new emperor confiscated money from the aristocracy and high officials to be put to public use these actions endeared alexios to the citizens but alienated his relations and other prominent supporters once in firm control alexios closed the gates of the city to the crusaders and strengthened the fortifications sword in hand he was active in leading attacks on sorties made by the crusaders in search of supplies on february henry of flanders led part of the crusader army
