the acropolis of athens is an ancient citadel located on rocky outcrop above the city of athens and contains the remains of several ancient buildings of great architectural and historic significance the most famous being the parthenon the word acropolis is from the greek words akron highest point extremity and polis city although the term acropolis is generic and there are many other acropoleis in greece the significance of the acropolis of athens is such that it is commonly known as the acropolis without qualification during ancient times it was known also more properly as cecropia after the legendary serpent man cecrops the supposed first athenian king while there is evidence that the hill was inhabited as far back as the fourth millennium bc it was pericles bc in the fifth century bc who coordinated the construction of the site most important present remains including the parthenon the propylaea the erechtheion and the temple of athena nike the parthenon and the other buildings were seriously damaged during the siege by the venetians during the morean war when gunpowder being stored in the parthenon by the ottomans was hit by cannonball and exploded history the acropolis of athens as seen from mount lycabettus the wooded hill of the nymphs is half visible on its right and philopappos hill on the left immediately behind the philopappos monument stands where in the distant background the coast of peloponnese meet the waters of the saronic gulf early settlement the acropolis is located on flattish topped rock that rises above sea level in the city of athens with surface area of about while the earliest artifacts date to the middle neolithic era there have been documented habitations in attica from the early neolithic period th millennium bc mycenaean chamber tomb in the acropolis of athens th th century bc there is little doubt that mycenaean megaron palace stood upon the hill during the late bronze age nothing of this megaron survives except probably single limestone column base and pieces of several sandstone steps soon after the palace was constructed cyclopean massive circuit wall was built meters long up to meters high and ranging from to meters thick this wall would serve as the main defense for the acropolis until the th century the wall consisted of two parapets built with large stone blocks and cemented with an earth mortar called emplekton greek ἔμπλεκτον the wall uses typical mycenaean conventions in that it followed the natural contour of the terrain and its gate which was towards the south was arranged obliquely with parapet and tower overhanging the incomers right hand side thus facilitating defense there were two lesser approaches up the hill on its north side consisting of steep narrow flights of steps cut in the rock homer is assumed to refer to this fortification when he mentions the strong built house of erechtheus odyssey at some time before the th century bc an earthquake caused fissure near the northeastern edge of the acropolis this fissure extended some meters to bed of soft marl in which well was dug an elaborate set of stairs was built and the well served as an invaluable protected source of drinking water during times of siege for some portion of the mycenaean period archaic acropolis primitive acropolis with the pelargicon and the old temple of athena proposed elevation of the old temple of athena built around bc it stood between the parthenon and the erechtheum fragments of the sculptures in its pediments are in the acropolis museum not much is known about the architectural appearance of the acropolis until the archaic era during the th and the th centuries bc the site was controlled by kylon during the failed kylonian revolt and twice by peisistratos each of these were attempts directed at seizing political power by coups état apart from the hekatompedon mentioned later peisistratos also built an entry gate or propylaea nevertheless it seems that nine gate wall the enneapylon had been built around the acropolis hill and incorporating the biggest water spring the clepsydra at the northwestern foot temple to athena polias the tutelary deity of the

primitive parthenon architecture or bluebeard temple after the pedimental three bodied man serpent sculpture whose beards were painted dark blue whether this temple replaced an older one or just sacred precinct or altar is not known probably the hekatompedon was built where the parthenon now stands destruction of the acropolis by the armies of xerxes during the second persian invasion of

built upon the dörpfeld foundations between the erechtheion and the still standing parthenon arkhaios neōs was destroyed as part of the achaemenid destruction of athens during the second persian invasion of greece during bc however the temple was probably reconstructed during bc since the treasury of the delian league was transferred in its opisthodomos the temple may have been burnt down during bc as xenophon mentions that the old temple of athena was set afire pausanias does not mention it in his nd century ad description of greece around bc the hekatompedon was dismantled to make
