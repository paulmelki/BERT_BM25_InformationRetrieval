abalone or via spanish from rumsen aulón is common name for any of group of small to very large sea snails marine gastropod molluscs in the family haliotidae other common names are ear shells sea ears and muttonfish or muttonshells in australia ormer in the uk perlemoen in south africa and pāua in new zealand abalone are marine snails their taxonomy puts them in the family haliotidae which contains only one genus haliotis which once contained six subgenera these subgenera have become alternate representations of haliotis the number of species recognized worldwide ranges between and with over species level taxa described the most comprehensive treatment of the family considers species valid with additional subspecies the shells of abalones have low open spiral structure and are characterized by several open respiratory pores in row near the shell outer edge the thick inner layer of the shell is composed of nacre mother of pearl which in many species is highly iridescent giving rise to range of strong changeable colors which make the shells attractive to humans as decorative objects jewelry and as source of colorful mother of pearl the flesh of abalones is widely considered to be desirable food and is consumed raw or cooked by variety of cultures description iridescent surface inside red abalone shell from northern california the adjacent coin is mm in diameter abalone vary in size from haliotis pulcherrima to while haliotis rufescens is the largest of the genus at the shell of abalones is convex rounded to oval in shape and may be highly arched or very flattened the shell of the majority of species has small flat spire and two to three whorls the last whorl known as the body whorl is auriform meaning that the shell resembles an ear giving rise to the common name ear shell haliotis asinina has somewhat different shape as it is more elongated and distended the shell of haliotis cracherodii cracherodii is also unusual as it has an ovate form is imperforate shows an exserted spire and has prickly ribs mantle cleft in the shell impresses groove in the shell in which are the row of holes characteristic of the genus these holes are respiratory apertures for venting water from the gills and for releasing sperm and eggs into the water column they make up what is known as the selenizone which forms as the shell grows this series of eight to holes is near the anterior margin only small number is generally open the older holes are gradually sealed up as the shell grows and new holes form each species has typical number of open holes between four and in the selenizone an abalone has no operculum the aperture of the shell is very wide and nacreous the exterior of the shell is striated and dull the color of the shell is very variable from species to species which may reflect the animal diet the iridescent nacre that lines the inside of the shell varies in color from silvery white to pink red and green red to deep blue green to purple the animal has fimbriated head lobes and side lobes that are fimbriated and cirrated the radula has small median teeth and the lateral teeth are single and beam like they have about uncini with denticulated hooks the first four very large the rounded foot is very large in comparison to most molluscs the soft body is coiled around the columellar muscle and its insertion instead of being on the columella is on the middle of the inner wall of the shell the gills are symmetrical and both well developed these snails cling solidly with their broad muscular foot to rocky surfaces at sublittoral depths although some species such as haliotis cracherodii used to be common in the intertidal zone abalones reach maturity at relatively small size their fecundity is high and increases with their size laying from to million eggs at time the spermatozoa are filiform and pointed at one end and the anterior end is rounded head the adults provide no further assistance to the larvae and they are described as lecithotrophic the adults are herbivorous and feed with their rhipidoglossan radula on macroalgae preferring red or brown algae distribution abalone with live sponge on its shell in póvoa de varzim portugal the haliotid family has worldwide distribution along the coastal waters of every continent except the pacific coast of south america the atlantic coast of north america the arctic and antarctica the majority of abalone species are found in cold waters such as off the coasts of new zealand south africa australia western north america and japan structure and properties of the shell the shell of the abalone is exceptionally strong and is made of microscopic calcium carbonate tiles stacked like bricks between the layers of tiles is clingy protein substance when the abalone shell is struck the tiles slide instead of shattering and the protein stretches to absorb the energy of the blow material scientists around the world are studying this tiled structure for insight into stronger ceramic products such as body armor the dust created by grinding and cutting abalone shell is dangerous appropriate safeguards must be taken to protect people from inhaling these particles diseases and pests abalones are subject to various diseases the victorian department of primary industries said in that ganglioneuritis killed up to of stock in affected regions abalone are also severe hemophiliacs as their fluids will not clot in the case of laceration or puncture wound members of the spionidae of the polychaetes are known as pests of abalone human use the meat foot muscle of abalone is used for food and the shells of abalone are used as decorative items and as source of mother of pearl for jewelry buttons buckles and inlay abalone shells have been found in archaeological sites around the world ranging from year old deposits at blombos cave in south africa to historic chinese abalone middens on california northern channel islands on the
