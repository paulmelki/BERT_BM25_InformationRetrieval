an angle formed by two rays emanating from vertex in euclidean geometry an angle is the figure formed by two rays called the sides of the angle sharing common endpoint called the vertex of the angle angles formed by two rays lie in the plane that contains the rays angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes these are called dihedral angles two intersecting curves define also an angle which is the angle of the tangents at the intersection point for example the spherical angle formed by two great circles on sphere equals the dihedral angle between the planes containing the great circles angle is also used to designate the measure of an angle or of rotation this measure is the ratio of the length of circular arc to its radius in the case of geometric angle the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides in the case of rotation the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation history and etymology the word angle comes from the latin word angulus meaning corner cognate words are the greek ankylÎ¿s meaning crooked curved and the english word ankle both are connected with the proto indo european root ank meaning to bend or bow euclid defines plane angle as the inclination to each other in plane of two lines which meet each other and do not lie straight with respect to each other according to proclus an angle must be either quality or quantity or relationship the first concept was used by eudemus who regarded an angle as deviation from straight line the second by carpus of antioch who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines euclid adopted the third concept identifying angles in mathematical expressions it is common to use greek letters as variables denoting the size of some angle to avoid confusion with its other meaning the symbol is typically not used for this purpose lower case roman letters are also used as are upper case roman letters in the context of polygons see the figures in this article for examples in geometric figures angles may also be identified by the labels attached to the three points that define them for example the angle at vertex enclosed by the rays ab and ac the lines from point to point and point to point is denoted bac in unicode or where there is no risk of confusion the angle may sometimes be referred to simply by its vertex in this case angle potentially an angle denoted as say bac might refer to any of four angles the clockwise angle from to the anticlockwise angle from to the clockwise angle from to or the anticlockwise angle from to where the direction in which the angle is measured determines its sign see positive and negative angles however in many geometrical situations it is obvious from context that the positive angle less than or equal to degrees is meant in which case no ambiguity arises otherwise convention may be adopted so that bac always refers to the anticlockwise positive angle from to and cab the anticlockwise positive angle from to types of angles individual angles there is some common terminology for angles whose measure is always non negative see positive and negative angles an angle equal to or not turned is called zero angle angles smaller than right angle less than are called acute angles acute meaning sharp an angle equal to turn or radians is called right angle two lines that form right angle are said to be normal orthogonal or perpendicular angles larger than right angle and smaller than straight angle between and are called obtuse angles obtuse meaning blunt an angle equal to turn or radians is called straight angle angles larger than straight angle but less than turn between and are called reflex angles an angle equal to turn or radians is called full angle complete angle round angle or perigon angles that are not right angles or multiple of right angle are called oblique angles the names intervals and measuring units are shown in the table below name zero acute right angle obtuse straight reflex perigon units interval turns radians degrees gons equivalence angle pairs angles that have the same measure the same magnitude are said to be equal or congruent an angle is defined by its measure and is not dependent upon the lengths of the sides of the angle all right angles are equal in measure two angles that share terminal sides but differ in size by an integer multiple of turn are called coterminal angles reference angle is the acute version of any angle determined by repeatedly subtracting or adding straight angle turn or radians to the results as necessary until the magnitude of the result is an acute angle value between and turn or radians for example an angle of degrees has reference angle of degrees and an angle of degrees also has reference angle of degrees an angle of degrees has reference angle of degrees vertical and adjacent angle pairs angles and are pair of vertical angles angles and are pair of vertical angles when two straight lines intersect at point four angles are formed pairwise these angles are named according to their location relative to each other pair of angles opposite each other formed by two intersecting straight lines that form an like shape are called vertical angles or opposite angles or vertically opposite angles they are abbreviated as vert opp the equality of vertically opposite angles is called the vertical angle theorem eudemus of rhodes attributed the proof to thales of miletus the proposition showed that since both of pair of vertical angles are supplementary to both of the adjacent angles the vertical angles are equal in measure according to historical note when thales visited egypt he observed that whenever the egyptians drew two intersecting lines they would measure
