illustration of the use of interferometry in the optical wavelength range to determine precise positions of stars courtesy nasa jpl caltech astrometry is the branch of astronomy that involves precise measurements of the positions and movements of stars and other celestial bodies the information obtained by astrometric measurements provides information on the kinematics and physical origin of the solar system and our galaxy the milky way history tau spacecraft era study which would have used an interstellar precursor probe to expand the baseline for calculating stellar parallax in support of astrometry the history of astrometry is linked to the history of star catalogues which gave astronomers reference points for objects in the sky so they could track their movements this can be dated back to hipparchus who around bc used the catalogue of his predecessors timocharis and aristillus to discover earth precession in doing so he also developed the brightness scale still in use today hipparchus compiled catalogue with at least stars and their positions hipparchus successor ptolemy included catalogue of stars in his work the almagest giving their location coordinates and brightness in the th century abd al rahman al sufi carried out observations on the stars and described their positions magnitudes and star color furthermore he provided drawings for each constellation which are depicted in his book of fixed stars ibn yunus observed more than entries for the sun position for many years using large astrolabe with diameter of nearly metres his observations on eclipses were still used centuries later in simon newcomb investigations on the motion of the moon while his other observations of the motions of the planets jupiter and saturn inspired laplace obliquity of the ecliptic and inequalities of jupiter and saturn in the th century the timurid astronomer ulugh beg compiled the zij sultani in which he catalogued stars like the earlier catalogs of hipparchus and ptolemy ulugh beg catalogue is estimated to have been precise to within approximately minutes of arc in the th century tycho brahe used improved instruments including large mural instruments to measure star positions more accurately than previously with precision of arcsec taqi al din measured the right ascension of the stars at the constantinople observatory of taqi ad din using the observational clock he invented when telescopes became commonplace setting circles sped measurements james bradley first tried to measure stellar parallaxes in the stellar movement proved too insignificant for his telescope but he instead discovered the aberration of light and the nutation of the earth axis his cataloguing of stars was refined in by friedrich bessel the father of modern astrometry he made the first measurement of stellar parallax arcsec for the binary star cygni being very difficult to measure only about stellar parallaxes had been obtained by the end of the th century mostly by use of the filar micrometer astrographs using astronomical photographic plates sped the process in the early th century automated plate measuring machines and more sophisticated computer technology of the allowed more efficient compilation of star catalogues in the charge coupled devices ccds replaced photographic plates and reduced optical uncertainties to one milliarcsecond this technology made astrometry less expensive opening the field to an amateur audience in the european space agency hipparcos satellite took astrometry into orbit where it could be less affected by mechanical forces of the earth and optical distortions from its atmosphere operated from to hipparcos measured large and small angles on the sky with much greater precision than any previous optical telescopes during its year run the positions parallaxes and proper motions of stars were determined with an unprecedented degree of accuracy new tycho catalog drew together database of to within mas milliarcseconds additional catalogues were compiled for the double multiple stars and variable stars also analyzed during the hipparcos mission today the catalogue most often used is usno an all sky catalogue that tracks proper motions positions magnitudes and other characteristics for over one billion stellar objects during the past years schmidt camera plates were used to complete several sky surveys that make the data in usno accurate to within arcsec applications diagram showing how smaller object such as an extrasolar planet orbiting larger object such as star could produce changes in position and velocity of the latter as they orbit their common center of mass red cross barycenter of solar system relative to the sun apart from the fundamental function of providing astronomers with reference frame to report their observations in astrometry is also fundamental for fields like celestial mechanics stellar dynamics and galactic astronomy in observational astronomy astrometric techniques help identify stellar objects by their unique motions it is instrumental for keeping time in that utc is essentially the atomic time synchronized to earth rotation by means of exact astronomical observations astrometry is an important step in the cosmic distance ladder because it establishes parallax distance estimates for stars in the milky way astrometry has also been used to support claims of extrasolar planet detection by measuring the displacement the proposed planets cause in their parent star apparent position on the sky due to their mutual orbit around the center of mass of the system astrometry is more accurate in space missions that are not affected by the distorting effects of the earth atmosphere nasa planned space interferometry mission sim planetquest now cancelled was to utilize astrometric techniques to detect terrestrial planets orbiting or so of the nearest solar type stars the european space agency gaia mission launched in applies astrometric techniques in its stellar census in addition to the detection of exoplanets it can also be used to determine their mass astrometric measurements are used by astrophysicists to constrain certain models in celestial mechanics by measuring the velocities of pulsars it is possible to put limit on the asymmetry of supernova explosions also astrometric results are used to determine the distribution of dark matter in the galaxy astronomers use astrometric techniques for the tracking of near earth objects astrometry is responsible for the detection of
