aage niels bohr june september was danish nuclear physicist who shared the nobel prize in physics in with ben mottelson and james rainwater for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection starting from rainwater concept of an irregular shaped liquid drop model of the nucleus bohr and mottelson developed detailed theory that was in close agreement with experiments since his father niels bohr had won the prize in he and his father were one of the six pairs of fathers and sons who have both won the nobel prize and one of the four pairs who have both won the nobel prize in physics early life aage niels bohr was born in copenhagen on june the fourth of six sons of the physicist niels bohr and his wife margrethe bohr née nørlund his oldest brother christian died in boating accident in and his youngest harald from childhood meningitis of the others hans became physician erik chemical engineer and ernest lawyer and an olympic athlete who played field hockey for denmark at the summer olympics in london the family lived at the institute of theoretical physics at the university of copenhagen now known as the niels bohr institute where he grew up surrounded by physicists who were working with his father such as hans kramers oskar klein yoshio nishina wolfgang pauli and werner heisenberg in the family moved to the carlsberg æresbolig mansion donated by carl jacobsen the heir to carlsberg breweries to be used as an honorary residence by the dane who had made the most prominent contribution to science literature or the arts bohr went to high school at in copenhagen in shortly after the german occupation of denmark in april he entered the university of copenhagen where he studied physics he assisted his father helping draft correspondence and articles related to epistemology and physics in september word reached his family that the nazis considered them to be jewish because aage grandmother ellen adler bohr had been jewish and that they therefore were in danger of being arrested the danish resistance helped the family escape by sea to sweden bohr arrived there in october and then flew to britain on de havilland mosquito operated by british overseas airways corporation the mosquitoes were unarmed high speed bomber aircraft that had been converted to carry small valuable cargoes or important passengers by flying at high speed and high altitude they could cross german occupied norway and yet avoid german fighters bohr equipped with parachute flying suit and oxygen mask spent the three hour flight lying on mattress in the aircraft bomb bay on arrival in london bohr rejoined his father who had flown to britain the week before he officially became junior researcher at the department of scientific and industrial research but actually served as personal assistant and secretary to his father the two worked on tube alloys the british atomic bomb project on december they made the first of number of visits to the united states where his father was consultant to the manhattan project due to his father fame they were given false names bohr became james baker and his father nicholas baker in the director of the los alamos laboratory robert oppenheimer asked them to review the design of the modulated neutron initiator they reported that it would work that they had reached this conclusion put enrico fermi concerns about the viability of the design to rest the initiators performed flawlessly in the bombs used in the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki in august career in august with the war ended bohr returned to denmark where he resumed his university education graduating with master degree in with thesis concerned with some aspects of atomic stopping power problems in early bohr became member of the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey while paying visit to columbia university he met isidor isaac rabi who sparked in him an interest in recent discoveries related to the hyperfine structure of deuterium this led to bohr becoming visiting fellow at columbia from january to august while in the united states bohr married marietta soffer on march they had three children vilhelm tomas and margrethe by the late it was known that the properties of atomic nuclei could not be explained by then current models such as the liquid drop model developed by niels bohr amongst others the shell model developed in by maria goeppert mayer and others allowed some additional features to be explained in particular the so called magic numbers however there were also properties that could not be explained including the non spherical distribution of charge in certain nuclei in paper james rainwater of columbia university suggested variant of the drop model of the nucleus that could explain non spherical charge distribution rainwater model postulated nucleus like balloon with balls inside that distort the surface as they move about he discussed the idea with bohr who was visiting columbia at the time and had independently conceived the same idea and had about month after rainwater submission submitted for publication paper that discussed the same problem but along more general lines bohr imagined rotating irregular shaped nucleus with form of surface tension bohr developed the idea further in publishing paper that comprehensively treated the relationship between oscillations of the surface of the nucleus and the movement of the individual nucleons upon his return to copenhagen in bohr began working with ben mottelson to compare the theoretical work with experimental data in three papers that were published in and bohr and mottelson demonstrated close agreement between theory and experiment for example showing that the energy levels of certain nuclei could be described by rotation spectrum they were thereby able to reconcile the shell model with rainwater concept this work stimulated many new theoretical and experimental studies bohr mottelson and rainwater were jointly awarded the nobel prize
