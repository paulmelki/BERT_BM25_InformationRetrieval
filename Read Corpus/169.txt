pasture in the east riding of yorkshire in england agricultural land that is not arable according to the fao definition above includes permanent crop land that produces crops from woody vegetation orchardland vineyards coffee plantations rubber plantations and land producing nut trees meadows and pastures land used as pasture and grazed range and those natural grasslands and sedge meadows that are used for hay production in some regions other non arable land includes land that is not suitable for any agricultural use land that is not arable in the sense of lacking capability or suitability for cultivation for crop production has one or more limitations lack of sufficient fresh water for irrigation stoniness steepness adverse climate excessive wetness with impracticality of drainage and or excessive salts among others although such limitations may preclude cultivation and some will in some cases preclude any agricultural use large areas unsuitable for cultivation may still be agriculturally productive for example us nrcs statistics indicate that about percent of us non federal pasture and unforested rangeland is unsuitable for cultivation yet such land has value for grazing of livestock in british columbia canada percent of the provincial agricultural land reserve area is unsuitable for production of cultivated crops but is suitable for uncultivated production of forage usable by grazing livestock similar examples can be found in many rangeland areas elsewhere land incapable of being cultivated for production of crops can sometimes be converted to arable land new arable land makes more food and can reduce starvation this outcome also makes country more self sufficient and politically independent because food importation is reduced making non arable land arable often involves digging new irrigation canals and new wells aqueducts desalination plants planting trees for shade in the desert hydroponics fertilizer nitrogen fertilizer pesticides reverse osmosis water processors pet film insulation or other insulation against heat and cold digging ditches and hills for protection against the wind and installing greenhouses with internal light and heat for protection against the cold outside and to provide light in cloudy areas such modifications are often prohibitively expensive an alternative is the seawater greenhouse which desalinates water through evaporation and condensation using solar energy as the only energy input this technology is optimized to grow crops on desert land close to the sea note
