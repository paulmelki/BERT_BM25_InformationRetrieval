athanasius kircher map of atlantis placing it in the middle of the atlantic ocean from mundus subterraneus published in amsterdam the map is oriented with south at the top atlantis island of atlas is fictional island mentioned in an allegory on the hubris of nations in plato works timaeus and critias where it represents the antagonist naval power that besieges ancient athens the pseudo historic embodiment of plato ideal state in the republic in the story athens repels the atlantean attack unlike any other nation of the known world supposedly bearing witness to the superiority of plato concept of state the story concludes with atlantis falling out of favor with the deities and submerging into the atlantic ocean despite its minor importance in plato work the atlantis story has had considerable impact on literature the allegorical aspect of atlantis was taken up in utopian works of several renaissance writers such as francis bacon new atlantis and thomas more utopia on the other hand nineteenth century amateur scholars misinterpreted plato narrative as historical tradition most famously ignatius donnelly in his atlantis the antediluvian world plato vague indications of the time of the events more than years before his time and the alleged location of atlantis beyond the pillars of hercules has led to much speculation as consequence atlantis has become byword for any and all supposed advanced prehistoric lost civilizations and continues to inspire contemporary fiction from comic books to films while present day philologists and classicists agree on the story fictional character there is still debate on what served as its inspiration as for instance with the story of gyges plato is known to have freely borrowed some of his allegories and metaphors from older traditions this led number of scholars to investigate possible inspiration of atlantis from egyptian records of the thera eruption the sea peoples invasion or the trojan war others have rejected this chain of tradition as implausible and insist that plato created an entirely fictional account drawing loose inspiration from contemporary events such as the failed athenian invasion of sicily in bc or the destruction of helike in bc plato dialogues timaeus fifteenth century latin translation of plato timaeus the only primary sources for atlantis are plato dialogues timaeus and critias all other mentions of the island are based on them the dialogues claim to quote solon who visited egypt between and bc they state that he translated egyptian records of atlantis written in bc plato introduced atlantis in timaeus the four people appearing in those two dialogues are the politicians critias and hermocrates as well as the philosophers socrates and timaeus of locri although only critias speaks of atlantis in his works plato makes extensive use of the socratic method in order to discuss contrary positions within the context of supposition the timaeus begins with an introduction followed by an account of the creations and structure of the universe and ancient civilizations in the introduction socrates muses about the perfect society described in plato republic bc and wonders if he and his guests might recollect story which exemplifies such society critias mentions tale he considered to be historical that would make the perfect example and he then follows by describing atlantis as is recorded in the critias in his account ancient athens seems to represent the perfect society and atlantis its opponent representing the very antithesis of the perfect traits described in the republic critias according to critias the hellenic deities of old divided the land so that each deity might have their own lot poseidon was appropriately and to his liking bequeathed the island of atlantis the island was larger than ancient libya and asia minor combined but it was later sunk by an earthquake and became an impassable mud shoal inhibiting travel to any part of the ocean plato asserted that the egyptians described atlantis as an island consisting mostly of mountains in the northern portions and along the shore and encompassing great plain in an oblong shape in the south extending in one direction three thousand stadia about km mi but across the center inland it was two thousand stadia about km mi fifty stadia km mi from the coast was mountain that was low on all sides broke it off all round about the central island itself was five stades in diameter about km mi in plato metaphorical tale poseidon fell in love with cleito the daughter of evenor and leucippe who bore him five pairs of male twins the eldest of these atlas was made rightful king of the entire island and the ocean called the atlantic ocean in his honor and was given the mountain of his birth and the surrounding area as his fiefdom atlas twin gadeirus or eumelus in greek was given the extremity of the island toward the pillars of hercules the other four pairs of twins ampheres and evaemon mneseus and autochthon elasippus and mestor and azaes and diaprepes were also given rule over many men and large territory poseidon carved the mountain where his love dwelt into palace and enclosed it with three circular moats of increasing width varying from one to three stadia and separated by rings of land proportional in size the atlanteans then built bridges northward from the mountain making route to the rest of the island they dug great canal to the sea and alongside the bridges carved tunnels into the rings of rock so that ships could pass into the city around the mountain they carved docks from the rock walls of the moats every passage to the city was guarded by gates and towers and wall surrounded each ring of the city the walls were constructed of red white and black rock quarried from the moats and were covered with brass tin and the precious metal orichalcum respectively according to critias years before his lifetime war took place between those outside the pillars of hercules at the strait of gibraltar and those who dwelt within them the atlanteans
