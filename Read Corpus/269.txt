ardipithecus is genus of an extinct hominine that lived during the late miocene and early pliocene epochs in the afar depression ethiopia originally described as one of the earliest ancestors of humans after they diverged from the chimpanzees the relation of this genus to human ancestors and whether it is hominin is now matter of debate two fossil species are described in the literature ramidus which lived about million years ago during the early pliocene and kadabba dated to approximately million years ago late miocene behavioral analysis showed that ardipithecus could be very similar to chimpanzees indicating that the early human ancestors were very chimpanzee like in behavior ardipithecus ramidus ramidus was named in september the first fossil found was dated to million years ago on the basis of its stratigraphic position between two volcanic strata the basal gaala tuff complex and the daam aatu basaltic tuff the name ardipithecus ramidus stems mostly from the afar language in which ardi means ground floor and ramid means root the pithecus portion of the name is from the greek word for ape like most hominids but unlike all previously recognized hominins it had grasping hallux or big toe adapted for locomotion in the trees it is not confirmed how many other features of its skeleton reflect adaptation to bipedalism on the ground as well like later hominins ardipithecus had reduced canine teeth in research team headed by tim white discovered the first ramidus fossils seventeen fragments including skull mandible teeth and arm bones from the afar depression in the middle awash river valley of ethiopia more fragments were recovered in amounting to of the total skeleton this fossil was originally described as species of but white and his colleagues later published note in the same journal renaming the fossil under new genus ardipithecus between and team led by sileshi semaw discovered bones and teeth of nine ramidus individuals at as duma in the gona area of ethiopia afar region the fossils were dated to between and million years old map showing discovery locations ardipithecus ramidus had small brain measuring between and cm this is slightly smaller than modern bonobo or female common chimpanzee brain but much smaller than the brain of like lucy to cm and roughly the size of the modern homo sapiens brain like common chimpanzees ramidus was much more prognathic than modern humans the teeth of ramidus lacked the specialization of other apes and suggest that it was generalized omnivore and frugivore fruit eater with diet that did not depend heavily on foliage fibrous plant material roots tubers etc or hard and or abrasive food the size of the upper canine tooth in ramidus males was not distinctly different from that of females their upper canines were less sharp than those of modern common chimpanzees in part because of this decreased upper canine size as larger upper canines can be honed through wear against teeth in the lower mouth the features of the upper canine in ramidus contrast with the sexual dimorphism observed in common chimpanzees where males have significantly larger and sharper upper canine teeth than females the less pronounced nature of the upper canine teeth in ramidus has been used to infer aspects of the social behavior of the species and more ancestral hominids in particular it has been used to suggest that the last common ancestor of hominids and african apes was characterized by relatively little aggression between males and between groups this is markedly different from social patterns in common chimpanzees among which intermale and intergroup aggression are typically high researchers in study said that this condition compromises the living chimpanzee as behavioral model for the ancestral hominid condition ramidus existed more recently than the most recent common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees clca or pan homo lca and thus is not fully representative of that common ancestor nevertheless it is in some ways unlike chimpanzees suggesting that the common ancestor differs from the modern chimpanzee after the chimpanzee and human lineages diverged both underwent substantial evolutionary change chimp feet are specialized for grasping trees ramidus feet are better suited for walking the canine teeth of ramidus are smaller and equal in size between males and females which suggests reduced male to male conflict increased pair bonding and increased parental investment thus fundamental reproductive and social behavioral changes probably occurred in hominids long before they had enlarged brains and began to use stone tools the research team concluded ardi on october paleontologists formally announced the discovery of the relatively complete ramidus fossil skeleton first unearthed in the fossil is the remains of small brained kilogram lb female nicknamed ardi and includes most of the skull and teeth as well as the pelvis hands and feet it was discovered in ethiopia harsh afar desert at site called aramis in the middle awash region radiometric dating of the layers of volcanic ash encasing the deposits suggest that ardi lived about million years ago this date however has been questioned by others fleagle and kappelman suggest that the region in which ardi was found is difficult to date radiometrically and they argue that ardi should be dated at million years the fossil is regarded by its describers as shedding light on stage of human evolution about which little was known more than million years before lucy afarensis the iconic early human ancestor candidate who lived million years ago and was discovered in just away from ardi discovery site however because the ardi skeleton is no more than years older than the earliest fossils of and may in fact be younger than they are some researchers doubt that it can represent direct ancestor of some researchers infer from the form of her pelvis and limbs and the presence of her abductable hallux that ardi was facultative biped bipedal when moving on the ground but quadrupedal when moving about in tree branches ramidus had more primitive walking ability than later hominids and could not walk or run for long distances
