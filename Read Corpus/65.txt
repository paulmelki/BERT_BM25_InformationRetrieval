affirming the consequent sometimes called converse error fallacy of the converse or confusion of necessity and sufficiency is formal fallacy of taking true conditional statement if the lamp were broken then the room would be dark and invalidly inferring its converse the room is dark so the lamp is broken even though the converse may not be true this arises when consequent the room would be dark has more than one other possible antecedents for example the lamp is not plugged in or the lamp is in working order but is switched off converse errors are common in everyday thinking and communication and can result from among other causes communication issues misconceptions about logic and failure to consider other causes the opposite statement denying the consequent is valid form of argument formal description affirming the consequent is the action of taking true statement and invalidly concluding its converse the name affirming the consequent derives from using the consequent of to conclude the antecedent this illogic can be summarized formally as or alternatively the root cause of such logic error is sometimes failure to realize that just because is possible condition for may not be the only condition for may follow from another condition as well affirming the consequent can also result from the experience of many statements having true converses if and are equivalent statements it is possible to infer under the condition for example the statements it is august so it is my birthday and it is my birthday so it is august are equivalent and both true consequences of the statement august is my birthday an abbreviated form of using one statement to conclude the other is not an example of affirming the consequent but some people may misapply the approach additional examples example one way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with counterexample with true premises but an obviously false conclusion for example if bill gates owns fort knox then bill gates is rich bill gates is rich therefore bill gates owns fort knox owning fort knox is not the only way to be rich any number of other ways to be rich exist however one can affirm with certainty that if someone is not rich non then this person does not own fort knox non this is the contrapositive of the first statement and it must be true if and only if the original statement is true example here is another useful obviously fallacious example but one that does not require familiarity with who bill gates is and what fort knox is if an animal is dog then it has four legs my cat has four legs therefore my cat is dog here it is immediately intuitive that any number of other antecedents if an animal is deer if an animal is an elephant if an animal is moose etc can give rise to the consequent then it has four legs and that it is preposterous to suppose that having four legs must imply that the animal is dog and nothing else this is useful as teaching example since most people can immediately recognize that the conclusion reached must be wrong intuitively cat cannot be dog and that the method by which it was reached must therefore be fallacious example arguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing as in the following example if brian had been thrown off the top of the eiffel tower then he would be dead brian is dead therefore brian was thrown off the top of the eiffel tower being thrown off the top of the eiffel tower is not the only cause of death since there exist numerous different causes of death affirming the consequent is commonly used in rationalization and thus appears as coping mechanism in some people example in catch the chaplain is interrogated for supposedly being washington irving irving washington who has been blocking out large portions of soldiers letters home the colonel has found such letter but with the chaplain name signed you can read though can you the colonel persevered sarcastically the author signed his name that my name there then you wrote it in this case is the chaplain signs his own name and the chaplain name is written the chaplain name may be written but he did not necessarily write it as the colonel falsely concludes see also list of fallacies abductive reasoning appeal to consequences confusion of the inverse denying the antecedent eliza effect fallacy of the single cause fallacy of the undistributed middle inference to the best explanation modus ponens modus tollens post hoc ergo propter hoc necessity and sufficiency references
