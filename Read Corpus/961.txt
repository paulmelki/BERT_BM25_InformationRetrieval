origins statue next to the melbourne cricket ground on the approximate site of the football match between melbourne grammar and scotch college tom wills is depicted umpiring behind two young players contesting the ball the plaque reads that wills did more than any other person as footballer and umpire co writer of the rules and promoter of the game to develop australian football during its first decade there is evidence of football being played sporadically in the australian colonies in the first half of the th century compared to cricket and horse racing football was considered mere amusement at the time and while little is known about these early one off games it is clear they share no causal link with australian football in melbourne victoria in in move that would help to shape australian football in its formative years private schools then termed public schools in accordance with english scholastic nomenclature began organising football games inspired by precedents at english public schools the earliest such match held in st kilda on june was between melbourne grammar and st kilda grammar on july the melbourne based bell life in victoria and sporting chronicle published letter by tom wills captain of the victoria cricket team calling for the formation of foot ball club with code of laws to keep cricketers fit during winter born in australia wills played nascent form of rugby football whilst pupil at rugby school in england and returned to his homeland star athlete and cricketer his letter is regarded by many historians as giving impetus for the development of new code of football today known as australian football two weeks later wills friend cricketer jerry bryant posted an advertisement for scratch match at the richmond paddock adjoining the melbourne cricket ground mcg this was the first of several kickabouts held that year involving members of the melbourne cricket club including wills bryant hammersley and thompson trees were used as goalposts and play typically lasted an entire afternoon without an agreed upon code of laws some players were guided by rules they had learned in the british isles others by no rules at all another significant milestone in was match played under experimental rules between melbourne grammar and scotch college held at the richmond paddock this side contest umpired by wills and scotch college teacher john macadam began on august and continued over two subsequent saturdays ending in draw with each side kicking one goal it is commemorated with statue outside the mcg and the two schools have competed annually ever since in the cordner eggleston cup the world oldest continuous football competition since the early th century it has been suggested that australian football was derived from the irish sport of gaelic football which was not codified until there is no archival evidence in favour of gaelic influence and the style of play shared between the two modern codes appeared in australia long before the irish game evolved in similar direction another theory first proposed in posits that wills having grown up amongst aboriginal people in victoria may have seen or played the aboriginal ball game of marn grook and incorporated some of its features into early australian football the evidence that he knew of the game is only circumstantial and according to biographer greg de moore research wills was almost solely influenced by his experience at rugby school first rules loosely organised melbourne side captained by wills played against other football enthusiasts in
