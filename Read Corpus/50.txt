america heartland kansas through which her train was riding on july and the majestic view of the great plains from high atop pikes peak on the pinnacle of that mountain the words of the poem started

the national stature his music would attain bates was more fortunate since the song popularity was well established by the time of her death in it is included in songbooks in many religious congregations in the united states at various times in the more than one hundred years that have elapsed since the song was written particularly during the john kennedy administration there have been efforts to give america the beautiful legal status either as national hymn or as national anthem equal to or in place of the star spangled banner but so far this has not succeeded proponents prefer america the beautiful for various reasons saying it is easier to sing more melodic and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as the star spangled banner some prefer america the beautiful over the star spangled banner due to the latter war oriented imagery others prefer the star spangled banner for the same reason while that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem america the beautiful continues to be held in high esteem by large number of americans and was even being considered before as candidate to become the national anthem of the united states lyrics america poem for july original poem great for halcyon skies for amber waves of grain for purple mountain majesties above the
