is modern japanese martial art developed by morihei ueshiba as synthesis of his martial studies philosophy and religious beliefs ueshiba goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attackers from injury aikido is often translated as the way of unifying with life energy or as the way of harmonious spirit according to the founder philosophy the primary goal in the practice of aikido is to overcome oneself instead of cultivating violence or aggressiveness morihei ueshiba used the phrase true victory final victory over oneself here and now to refer to this principle mitsuteru ueshiba at the th all japan aikido demonstration held at the nippon budokan may aikido fundamental principles include irimi entering atemi kokyu ho breathing control sankaku ho triangular principle and tenkan turning movements that redirect the opponent attack momentum its curriculum comprises various techniques primarily throws and joint locks it also includes weapons system encompassing the bokken tantō and jō aikido derives mainly from the martial art of daitō ryū aiki jūjutsu but began to diverge from it in the late partly due to ueshiba involvement with the ōmoto kyō religion ueshiba early students documents bear the term aiki jūjutsu ueshiba senior students have different approaches to aikido depending partly on when they studied with him today aikido is found all over the world in number of styles with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis however they all share techniques formulated by ueshiba and most have concern for the well being of the attacker etymology and basic philosophy ki in its old character form the word aikido is formed of three kanji ai harmony unifying ki energy spirit dō way path the term aiki does not readily appear in the japanese language outside the scope of budō this has led to many possible interpretations of the word is mainly used in compounds to mean combine unite join together meet examples being combined united composition unite combine join together union alliance association combine unify and mutual agreement there is an idea of reciprocity to get to know one another talk discussion negotiation and meet by appointment is often used to describe feeling or emotive action as in feel as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning and feeling sensation it is used to mean energy or force as in electricity and magnetism it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things as in spirit trait temperament the characters aeteological history can be traced back to the much older chinese character of qi that is used extensively in traditional chinese medicine and acupunture the term in aikido is derived from the word tao in chinese and is found in many other japanese martial arts such as judo and kendo and in various non martial arts such as japanese calligraphy flower arranging and tea ceremony therefore from purely literal interpretation aikido is the way of combining forces or way of unifying energy in which the term aiki refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort one applies by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply counter technique history ueshiba in tokyo in aikido was created by morihei ueshiba referred to by some aikido practitioners as great teacher the term aikido was coined in the twentieth century ueshiba envisioned aikido not only as the synthesis of his martial training but as an expression of his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation during ueshiba lifetime and continuing today aikido has evolved from the aiki that ueshiba studied into variety of expressions by martial artists throughout the world initial development takeda sōkaku ueshiba developed aikido primarily during the late through the through the synthesis of the older martial arts that he had studied the core martial art from which aikido derives is daitō ryū aiki jūjutsu which ueshiba studied directly with takeda sōkaku the reviver of that art additionally ueshiba is known to have studied tenjin shin yō ryū with tozawa tokusaburō in tokyo in gotōha yagyū shingan ryū under nakai masakatsu in sakai from to and judo with kiyoichi takagi in

in his official association with daitō ryū continued until however during the latter part of that period ueshiba had already begun to distance himself from takeda and the daitō ryū at that time
