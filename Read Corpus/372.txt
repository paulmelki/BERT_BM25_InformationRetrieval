stockless ship anchor and chain on display anchor of amoco cadiz in portsall north west brittany france an anchor is device normally made of metal used to connect vessel to the bed of body of water to prevent the craft from drifting due to wind or current the word derives from latin ancora which itself comes from the greek ἄγκυρα ankura anchors can either be temporary or permanent permanent anchors are used in the creation of mooring and are rarely moved specialist service is normally needed to move or maintain them vessels carry one or more temporary anchors which may be of different designs and weights sea anchor is drag device not in contact with the seabed used to minimise drift of vessel relative to the water drogue is drag device used to slow or help steer vessel running before storm in following or overtaking sea or when crossing bar in breaking sea overview stockless anchor being broken out holding ground in akaroa harbour anchors achieve holding power either by hooking into the seabed or sheer mass or combination of the two permanent moorings use large masses commonly block or slab of concrete resting on the seabed semi permanent mooring anchors such as mushroom anchors and large ship anchors derive significant portion of their holding power from their mass while also hooking or embedding in the bottom modern anchors for smaller vessels have metal flukes which hook on to rocks on the bottom or bury themselves in soft seabed the vessel is attached to the anchor by the rode commonly called cable when made of rope and made of chain in larger vessels or combination of these the ratio of the length of rode to the water depth is known as the scope generally the rode should be between and times the depth to the seabed giving scope of or the larger the number the shallower the angle is between the cable and the seafloor and the less upwards force is acting on the anchor scope gives the greatest holding power but also allows for much more drifting due to the longer amount of cable paid out anchoring with sufficient scope and or heavy chain rode brings the direction of strain close to parallel with the seabed this is particularly important for light modern anchors designed to bury in the bottom where scopes of to are common whereas heavy anchors and moorings can use scope of or less some modern anchors such as the ultra will hold with scope of but unless the anchorage is crowded longer scope will always reduce shock stresses since all anchors that embed themselves in the bottom require the strain to be along the seabed anchors can be broken out of the bottom by shortening the rope until the vessel is directly above the anchor at this point the anchor chain is up and down in naval parlance if necessary motoring slowly around the location of the anchor also helps dislodge it anchors are sometimes fitted with tripping line attached to the crown by which they can be unhooked from rocks or coral the term aweigh describes an anchor when it is hanging on the rope and is not resting on the bottom this is linked to the term to weigh anchor meaning to lift the anchor from the sea bed allowing the ship or boat to move an anchor is described as aweigh when it has been broken out of the bottom and is being hauled up to be stowed aweigh should not be confused with under way which describes vessel which is not moored to dock or anchored whether or not the vessel is moving through the water holding ground holding ground is the area of sea floor which holds an anchor and thus the attached ship or boat different types of anchor are designed to hold in different types of holding ground some bottom materials hold better than others for instance hard sand holds well shell very poorly holding ground may be fouled with obstacles an anchorage location may be chosen for its holding ground in poor holding ground only the weight of an anchor matters in good holding ground it is able to dig in and the holding power can be significantly higher evolution and history of the anchor anchors come in wide variety of shapes types and sizes for different conditions functions and vessels the earliest anchors were probably rocks and many rock anchors have been found dating from at least the bronze age pre european maori waka canoes used one or more hollowed stones tied with flax ropes as anchors many modern moorings still rely on large rock as the primary element of their design however using pure mass to resist the forces of storm only works well as permanent mooring large enough rock would be nearly impossible to move to new location the ancient greeks used baskets of stones large sacks filled with sand and wooden logs filled with lead according to apollonius rhodius and stephen of byzantium anchors were formed of stone and athenaeus states that they were also sometimes made of wood such anchors held the vessel merely by their weight and by their friction along the bottom fluked anchors anchor of the ladby ship iron was afterwards introduced for the construction of anchors and an improvement was made by forming them with teeth or flukes to fasten themselves into the bottom this is the iconic anchor shape most familiar to non sailors this form has been used since antiquity the roman nemi ships of the st century ad used this form the viking ladby ship probably th century used fluked anchor of this type made entirely of iron admiralty anchor an admiralty pattern anchor when deployed on the seafloor the stock forces one of its flukes into the bottom the admiralty pattern anchor or simply admiralty also known as fisherman consists of central shank with ring or shackle for attaching the rode the rope chain
