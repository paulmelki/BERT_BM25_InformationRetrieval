right africa is continent comprising political territories representing the largest of the great southward projections from the main mass of earth surface within its regular outline it comprises an area of excluding adjacent islands its highest mountain is mount kilimanjaro its largest lake is lake victoria separated from europe by the mediterranean sea and from much of asia by the red sea africa is joined to asia at its northeast extremity by the isthmus of suez which is transected by the suez canal wide for geopolitical purposes the sinai peninsula of egypt east on the suez canal is often considered part of africa from the most northerly point ras ben sakka in tunisia at to the more southerly point cape agulhas in south africa is distance approximately of from cap vert the westernmost point to ras hafun in the somali puntland region in the horn of africa the most easterly projection is distance also approximately of the main structural lines of the continent show both the east to west direction characteristic at least in the eastern hemisphere of the more northern parts of the world and the north to south direction seen in the southern peninsulas africa is thus mainly composed of two segments at right angles the northern running from east to west and the southern from north to south main features satellite view of africa physical map of africa the average elevation of the continent approximates closely to above sea level roughly near to the mean elevation of both north and south america but considerably less than that of asia in contrast with other continents it is marked by the comparatively small area of either very high or very low ground lands under occupying an unusually small part of the surface while not only are the highest elevations inferior to those of asia or south america but the area of land over is also quite insignificant being represented almost entirely by individual peaks and mountain ranges moderately elevated tablelands are thus the characteristic feature of the continent though the surface of these is broken by higher peaks and ridges so prevalent are these isolated peaks and ridges that specialised term inselberg landschaft island mountain landscape has been adopted in germany to describe this kind of country thought to be in great part the result of wind action as general rule the higher tablelands lie to the east and south while progressive diminution in altitude towards the west and north is observable apart from the lowlands and the atlas mountain range the continent may be divided into two regions of higher and lower plateaus the dividing line somewhat concave to the north west running from the middle of the red sea to about deg on the west coast africa can be divided into number of geographic zones the coastal plains often fringed seawards by mangrove swamps never stretching far from the coast apart from the lower courses of streams recent alluvial flats are found chiefly in the delta of the more important rivers elsewhere the coastal lowlands merely form the lowest steps of the system of terraces that constitutes the ascent to the inner plateaus the atlas range distinct from the rest of the continent being unconnected with and separated from the south by depressed and desert area the sahara plateau region topography of africa the high southern and eastern plateaus rarely falling below have mean elevation of about the south african plateau as far as about is bounded east west and south by bands of high ground which fall steeply to the coasts on this account south africa has general resemblance to an inverted saucer due south the plateau rim is formed by three parallel steps with level ground between them the largest of these level areas the great karoo is dry barren region and large tract of the plateau proper is of still more arid character and is known as the kalahari desert the south african plateau is connected towards east african plateau with probably slightly greater average elevation and marked by some distinct features it is formed by widening out of the eastern axis of high ground which becomes subdivided into number of zones running north and south and consisting in turn of ranges tablelands and depressions the most striking feature is the existence of two great lines of depression due largely to the subsidence of whole segments of the earth crust the lowest parts of which are occupied by vast lakes towards the south the two lines converge and give place to one great valley occupied by lake nyasa the southern part of which is less distinctly due to rifting and subsidence than the rest of the system farther north the western hollow known as the albertine rift is occupied for more than half its length by water forming the great lakes of tanganyika kivu lake edward and lake albert the first named over long and the longest freshwater lake in the world associated with these great valleys are number of volcanic peaks the greatest of which occur on meridional line east of the eastern trough the eastern branch of the east african rift contains much smaller lakes many of them brackish and without outlet the only one comparable to those of the western trough being lake turkana or basso norok short distance east of this rift valley is mount kilimanjaro with its two peaks kibo and mawenzi the latter being and the culminating point of the whole continent and mount kenya which is hardly less important is the ruwenzori range over which lies east of the western trough other volcanic peaks rise from the floor of the valleys some of the kirunga mfumbiro group north of lake kivu being still partially active this could cause most of the cities and states to be flooded with lava and ash the third division of the higher region of africa is formed by the ethiopian highlands rugged mass of mountains forming the largest continuous area of its
