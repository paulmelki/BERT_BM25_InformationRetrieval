an antipope is person who in opposition to the lawful pope makes significant attempt to occupy the position of bishop of rome and leader of the catholic church at times between the rd and mid th centuries antipopes were supported by important factions within the church itself and by secular rulers sometimes it was difficult to distinguish which of two claimants should be called pope and which antipope as in the case of pope leo viii and pope benedict persons who merely claim to be pope and have few followers such as the modern sedevacantist antipopes are not classified with the historical antipopes history hippolytus of rome is commonly considered to be the earliest antipope as he headed separate group within the church in rome against pope callixtus hippolytus was reconciled to callixtus second successor pope pontian and both he and pontian are honoured as saints by the catholic church with shared feast day on august whether two or more persons have been confused in this account of hippolytus and whether hippolytus actually declared himself to be the bishop of rome remains unclear since no such claim by hippolytus has been cited in the writings attributed to him eusebius quotes from an unnamed earlier writer the story of natalius rd century priest who accepted the bishopric of the adoptionists heretical group in rome natalius soon repented and tearfully begged pope zephyrinus to receive him into communion novatian another third century figure certainly claimed the see of rome in opposition to pope cornelius and if natalius and hippolytus were excluded because of the uncertainties concerning them novatian could then be said to be the first antipope the period in which antipopes were most numerous was during the struggles between the popes and the holy roman emperors of the th and th centuries the emperors frequently imposed their own nominees to further their own causes the popes likewise sometimes sponsored rival imperial claimants anti kings in germany to overcome particular emperor the western schism which began in when the french cardinals claiming that the election of pope urban vi was invalid elected antipope clement vii as rival to the roman pope led eventually to two competing lines of antipopes the avignon line clement vii took up residence in avignon france and the pisan line the pisan line which began in was named after the town of pisa italy where the pisan council had elected antipope alexander as third claimant to end the schism in may the council of constance deposed antipope john xxiii of the pisan line pope gregory xii of the roman line resigned in july in the council also formally deposed antipope benedict xiii of avignon but he refused to resign afterwards pope martin was elected and was accepted everywhere except in the small and rapidly diminishing area that remained faithful to benedict xiii the scandal of the western schism created anti papal sentiment and fed into the protestant reformation at the turn of the th century list of historical antipopes the following table gives the names of the antipopes included in the list of popes and antipopes in the annuario pontificio with the addition of the names of natalius in spite of doubts about his historicity and antipope clement viii whose following was insignificant an asterisk marks those who were included in the conventional numbering of later popes who took the same name more commonly the antipope is ignored in later papal regnal numbers for example there was an antipope john xxiii but the new pope john elected in was also called john xxiii for the additional confusion regarding popes named john see pope john numbering the list of popes and antipopes in the annuario pontificio attaches the following note to the name of pope leo viii at this point as again in the mid th century we come across elections in which problems of harmonising historical criteria and those of theology and canon law make it impossible to decide clearly which side possessed the legitimacy whose factual existence guarantees the unbroken lawful succession of the successors of saint peter the uncertainty that in some cases results has made it advisable to abandon the assignation of successive numbers in the list of the popes thus because of the obscurities about mid th century canon law and the historical facts the annuario pontificio lists sylvester iii as pope without thereby expressing judgement on his legitimacy the catholic encyclopedia places him in its list of popes but with the annotation considered by some to be an antipope other sources classify him as an antipope those with asterisks were counted in subsequent papal numbering pontificate common english name regnal latin name personal name place of birth age
