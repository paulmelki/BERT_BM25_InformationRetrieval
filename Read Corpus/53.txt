zinc typical metal reacting with hydrochloric acid typical acid an acid is molecule or ion capable of donating proton hydrogen ion brønsted lowry acid or alternatively capable of forming covalent bond with an electron pair lewis acid the first category of acids are the proton donors or brønsted lowry acids in the special case of aqueous solutions proton donors form the hydronium ion and are known as arrhenius acids brønsted and lowry generalized the arrhenius theory to include non aqueous solvents brønsted or arrhenius acid usually contains hydrogen atom bonded to chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of aqueous arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide practical description of an acid acids form aqueous solutions with sour taste can turn blue litmus red and react with bases and certain metals like calcium to form salts the word acid is derived from the latin acidus acēre meaning sour an aqueous solution of an acid has ph less than and is colloquially also referred to as acid as in dissolved in acid while the strict definition refers only to the solute lower ph means higher acidity and thus higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes acetic acid vinegar is dilute aqueous solution of this liquid sulfuric acid used in car batteries and citric acid found in citrus fruits as these examples show acids in the colloquial sense can be solutions or pure substances and can be derived from acids in the strict sense that are solids liquids or gases strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid the second category of acids are lewis acids which form covalent bond with an electron pair an example is boron trifluoride bf whose boron atom has vacant orbital which can form covalent bond by sharing lone pair of electrons on an atom in base for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia nh lewis considered this as generalization of the brønsted definition so that an acid is chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons into the solution which then accept electron pairs however hydrogen chloride acetic acid and most other brønsted lowry acids cannot form covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not lewis acids conversely many lewis acids are not arrhenius or brønsted lowry acids in modern terminology an acid is implicitly brønsted acid and not lewis acid since chemists almost always refer to lewis acid explicitly as lewis acid definitions and concepts modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions or can be dissolved in water so the arrhenius and brønsted lowry definitions are the most relevant the brønsted lowry definition is the most widely used definition unless otherwise specified acid base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of proton from an acid to base hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions although alcohols and amines can be brønsted lowry acids they can also function as lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms arrhenius acids svante arrhenius in svante arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions later described as protons or hydrons an arrhenius acid is substance that when added to water increases the concentration of ions in the water note that chemists often write aq and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus proton does not exist alone in water it exists as the hydronium ion or other forms thus an arrhenius acid can also be described as substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water examples include molecular substances such as hydrogen chloride and acetic acid an arrhenius base on the other hand is substance which increases the concentration of hydroxide oh ions when dissolved in water this decreases the concentration of hydronium because the ions react to form molecules oh due to this equilibrium any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by decrease in the concentration of hydroxide thus an arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration while an arrhenius base increases it in an acidic solution the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than moles per liter since ph is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions acidic solutions thus have ph of less than brønsted lowry acids acetic acid weak acid donates proton hydrogen ion highlighted in green to water in an equilibrium reaction to give the acetate ion and the hydronium ion red oxygen black carbon white hydrogen while the arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions it is also quite limited in its scope in chemists johannes nicolaus brønsted and thomas martin lowry independently recognized that acid base reactions involve the transfer of proton brønsted lowry acid or simply brønsted acid is species that donates proton to brønsted lowry base brønsted lowry acid base theory has several advantages over arrhenius theory consider the following reactions of acetic acid ch cooh the organic acid that gives vinegar its characteristic taste both theories easily describe the first reaction ch cooh acts as an arrhenius acid because it acts as source of when dissolved in water and it acts as brønsted acid by donating proton to water in the second example ch cooh undergoes the same transformation in this case donating proton to ammonia nh but does not relate to the arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium nevertheless ch cooh is both an arrhenius and brønsted lowry acid brønsted lowry theory can be used to describe reactions of molecular compounds in nonaqueous
