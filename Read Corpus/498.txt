herm of hermes roman copy of late th century bc original the forefront inscription states the herm was made by alcamenes and dedicated by pergamios istanbul museums alcamenes was an ancient greek sculptor of lemnos and athens who flourished in the nd half of the th century bc he was younger contemporary of phidias and noted for the delicacy and finish of his works among which hephaestus and an aphrodite of the gardens were conspicuous pausanias says that he was the author of one of the pediments of the temple of zeus at olympia but this seems chronological and stylistic impossibility pausanias also refers to statue of ares by alcamenes that was erected on the athenian agora which some have related to the ares borghese however the temple of ares to which he refers had only been moved from acharnes and re sited in the agora in augustus time and statues known to derive from alcamenes statue show the god in breastplate so the identification of alcamenes ares with the ares borghese is not secure at pergamum there was discovered in hellenistic copy of the head of the hermes propylaeus of alcamenes as however the deity is represented in neo attic archaistic and conventional character this copy cannot be relied on as giving us much information as to the usual style of alcamenes who was almost certainly progressive and original artist it is safer to judge him by the sculptural decoration of the parthenon in which he must almost certainly have taken share under the direction of phidias he is said to be the most eminent sculptor in athens after the departure of phidias for olympia but enigmatic in that none of the sculptures associated with his name in classical literature can be securely connected with existing copies notes references julius sillig dictionary of the artists of antiquity andrew stewart one hundred greek sculptors their careers and extant works sir charles waldstein alcamenes and the establishment of the classical type in greek art external links scholars resource works by alkamenes perseus digital library alcamenes herma by alcamenes uni graz
