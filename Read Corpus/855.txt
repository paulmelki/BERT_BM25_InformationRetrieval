antisemitism in the arab world has increased greatly since the beginning of the th century for several reasons the dissolution and breakdown of the ottoman empire and traditional islamic society european influence brought about by western imperialism and arab christians nazi propaganda and relations between nazi germany and the arab world resentment over jewish nationalism and the rise of arab nationalism traditionally jews in the muslim world were considered to be people of the book and were subjected to dhimmi status they were afforded relative security against persecution provided they did not contest the varying inferior social and legal status imposed on them in islamic states while there were antisemitic incidents before the th century during this time antisemitism in the arab world increased greatly during the and the several jewish communities in the arab world suffered from pogroms the status of jews in arab countries deteriorated further at the onset of the arab israeli conflict after the arab israeli war the palestinian exodus the creation of the state of israel and israeli victories during the wars of and were severe humiliation to israel opponents primarily egypt syria and iraq however by the mid the vast majority of jews had left arab and muslim countries moving primarily to israel france and the united states the reasons for the exodus are varied and disputed by the according to historian bernard lewis the volume of antisemitic literature published in the arab world and the authority of its sponsors seemed to suggest that classical antisemitism had become an essential part of arab intellectual life considerably more than in late th and early th century france and to degree that has been compared to nazi germany the rise of political islam during the and afterwards provided new mutation of islamic antisemitism giving the hatred of jews religious component in their report on contemporary arab muslim antisemitism the israeli intelligence and terrorism information center dates the beginning of this phenomenon to the spread of classic european christian antisemitism into the arab world starting in the late th century in the anti defamation league published global survey of worldwide antisemitic attitudes reporting that in the middle east of adults agreed with majority of the survey eleven antisemitic propositions including that jews have too much power in international financial markets and that jews are responsible for most of the world wars medieval times jews along with christians sabians and zoroastrians living under early and medieval muslim rule were known as people of the book to muslims and subjected to the status of dhimmi protected minority in the lands conquered by muslim arabs status generally applied to non muslim minorities that was later also extended to other non muslims like sikhs hindus jains and buddhists jews were generally seen as religious group not separate race thus being part of the arab family dhimmi were subjected to number of restrictions the application and severity of which varied with time and place restrictions included residency in segregated quarters obligation to wear distinctive clothing such as the yellow badge public subservience to muslims prohibitions against proselytizing and against marrying muslim women and limited access to the legal system the testimony of jew did not count if contradicted by that of muslim dhimmi had to pay special poll tax the jizya which exempted them from military service and also from payment of the zakat alms tax required of muslims in return dhimmi were granted limited rights including degree of tolerance community autonomy in personal matters and protection from being killed outright jewish communities like christian ones were typically constituted as semi autonomous entities managed by their own laws and leadership who carried the responsibility for the community towards the muslim rulers by medieval standards conditions for jews under islam were generally more formalized and better than those of jews in christian lands in part due to the sharing of minority status with christians in these lands there is evidence for this claim in that the status of jews in lands with no christian minority was usually worse than their status in lands with one for example there were numerous incidents of massacres and ethnic cleansing of jews in north africa especially in morocco libya and algeria where eventually jews were forced to live in ghettos decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues were enacted in the middle ages in egypt syria iraq and yemen at certain times in yemen morocco and baghdad jews were forced to convert to islam or face the death penalty the situation where jews both enjoyed cultural and economic prosperity at times but were widely persecuted at other times was summarised by von grunebaum it would not be difficult to put together the names of very sizable number of jewish subjects or citizens of the islamic area who have attained to high rank to power to great financial influence to significant and recognized intellectual attainment and the same could be done for christians but it would again not be difficult to compile lengthy list of persecutions arbitrary confiscations attempted forced conversions or pogroms views in modernity some scholars hold that arab antisemitism in the modern world arose in the nineteenth century against the backdrop of conflicting jewish and arab nationalism and was imported into the arab world primarily by minded christian arabs and only subsequently was it islamized mark cohen states according to bernard lewis th century the damascus affair was an accusation of ritual murder and blood libel against jews in damascus in on february franciscan capuchin friar father thomas and his greek servant were reported missing never to be seen again the turkish governor and the french consul ratti menton believed accusations of ritual murder and blood libel as the alleged murder occurred before the jewish passover an investigation was staged and solomon negrin jewish barber confessed under torture and accused other jews two other jews died under torture and one moses abulafia converted to islam to escape torture more arrests and atrocities followed culminating in jewish
