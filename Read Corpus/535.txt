fao statistical yearbook aquaculture production by region aquaculture less commonly spelled aquiculture also known as aquafarming is the farming of fish crustaceans molluscs aquatic plants algae and other organisms aquaculture involves cultivating freshwater and saltwater populations under controlled conditions and can be contrasted with commercial fishing which is the harvesting of wild fish mariculture commonly known as marine farming refers to aquaculture practiced in marine environments and in underwater habitats according to the food and agriculture organization fao aquaculture is understood to mean the farming of aquatic organisms including fish molluscs crustaceans and aquatic plants farming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production such as regular stocking feeding protection from predators etc farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated the reported output from global aquaculture operations in supplied over one half of the fish and shellfish that is directly consumed by humans however there are issues about the reliability of the reported figures further in current aquaculture practice products from several pounds of wild fish are used to produce one pound of piscivorous fish like salmon particular kinds of aquaculture include fish farming shrimp farming oyster farming mariculture algaculture such as seaweed farming and the cultivation of ornamental fish particular methods include aquaponics and integrated multi trophic aquaculture both of which integrate fish farming and aquatic plant farming the food and agriculture organization describes aquaculture as one of the industries most directly affected by climate change and its impacts some forms of aquaculture such as seaweed farming have the opportunity to be part of climate change mitigation while other forms of aquaculture have negative impacts on the environment such as through nutrient pollution or disease

indicates they developed about of volcanic floodplains in the vicinity of lake condah into complex of channels and dams and used woven traps to capture eels and preserve them to eat all year round the budj bim cultural landscape world heritage site is thought to be one of the oldest aquaculture sites in the world oral tradition in china tells of the culture of the common carp cyprinus carpio as long ago as bce around years bp but the earliest significant evidence lies in the literature in the earliest monograph on fish culture called the classic of fish culture by fan li written around bce bp another ancient chinese guide to aquaculture was by yang yu jing written around bce showing that carp farming was becoming more sophisticated the jiahu site in china has circumstantial archeological evidence as possibly the oldest aquaculture locations dating from bce about years bp but this is speculative when the waters subsided after river floods some fish mainly carp were trapped in lakes early aquaculturists fed their brood using nymphs and silkworm faeces and ate them ancient egyptians might have farmed fish especially gilt head bream from lake bardawil about bce years bp and they traded them with canaan gim cultivation is the oldest aquaculture in korea early cultivation methods used bamboo or oak sticks which were replaced by newer methods that utilized nets in the th century floating rafts have been used for mass production since the japanese cultivated seaweed by providing bamboo poles and later nets and oyster shells to serve as anchoring surfaces for spores romans bred fish in ponds and farmed oysters in coastal lagoons before ce in central europe early christian monasteries adopted roman aquacultural practices aquaculture spread in europe during the middle ages since away from the seacoasts and the big rivers fish had to be salted so they did not rot improvements in transportation during the th century made fresh fish easily available and inexpensive even in inland areas making aquaculture less popular the th century fishponds of the trebon basin in the czech republic are maintained as unesco world heritage site hawaiians constructed oceanic fish ponds remarkable example is the menehune fishpond dating from at least years ago at alekoko legend says that it was constructed by the mythical menehune dwarf people in the first half of the th century german stephan ludwig jacobi experimented with external fertilization of brown trouts and salmon he wrote an article von der k√ºnstlichen erzeugung der forellen und lachse on the artificial production of trout and salmon summarizing his findings and is regarded as the founder of artificial fish rearing in europe by the latter decades of the th century oyster farming had begun in estuaries along the atlantic coast of north america the word aquaculture appeared in an newspaper article in reference to the harvesting of ice it also appeared in descriptions of the terrestrial agricultural practise of sub irrigation in the late th century before becoming associated primarily with the cultivation of aquatic plant and animal species in stephen ainsworth of west bloomfield new york began experiments with brook trout by seth green had established commercial fish hatching operation at caledonia springs near rochester new york by with the involvement of dr fletcher of concord massachusetts artificial fish hatcheries were underway in both canada and the united states when the dildo island fish hatchery opened in newfoundland in it was the largest and most advanced in the world the word aquaculture was used in descriptions of the hatcheries experiments with cod and lobster in by the the american fish culture company of carolina rhode island founded in the was one of the leading producers of trout during the they had perfected the method of manipulating the day and night cycle of fish so that they could be artificially spawned year around californians harvested
