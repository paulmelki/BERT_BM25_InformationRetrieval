anno domini inscription at klagenfurt cathedral austria the terms ad and before christ bc are used to label or number years in the julian and gregorian calendars the term is medieval latin and means in the year of the lord but is often presented using our lord instead of the lord taken from the full original phrase anno domini nostri jesu christi which translates to in the year of our lord jesus christ this calendar era is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the conception or birth of jesus of nazareth with ad counting years from the start of this epoch and bc denoting years before the start of the era there is no year zero in this scheme so the year ad immediately follows the year bc this dating system was devised in by dionysius exiguus of scythia minor but was not widely used until after the gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world today for decades it has been the unofficial global standard adopted in the pragmatic interests of international communication transportation and commercial integration and recognized by international institutions such as the united nations traditionally english follows latin usage by placing the ad abbreviation before the year number however bc is placed after the year number for example ad but bc which also preserves syntactic order the abbreviation is also widely used after the number of century or millennium as in fourth century ad or second millennium ad although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions because bc is the english abbreviation for before christ it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that ad means after death after the death of jesus however this would mean that the approximate years commonly associated with the life of jesus would be included in neither the bc nor the ad time scales terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non christian people is to call this the current or common era abbreviated as ce with the preceding years referred to as before the common or current era bce astronomical year numbering and iso avoid words or abbreviations related to christianity but use the same numbers for ad years history the anno domini dating system was devised in by dionysius exiguus to enumerate the years in his easter table his system was to replace the diocletian era that had been used in an old easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of tyrant who persecuted christians the last year of the old table diocletian anno martyrium was immediately followed by the first year of his table anno domini when he devised his table julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year he himself stated that the present year was the consulship of probus junior which was years since the incarnation of our lord jesus christ thus dionysius implied that jesus incarnation occurred years earlier without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred however nowhere in his exposition of his table does dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system whether consulate olympiad year of the world or regnal year of augustus much less does he explain or justify the underlying date bonnie blackburn and leofranc holford strevens briefly present arguments for bc bc or ad as the year dionysius intended for the nativity or incarnation among the sources of confusion are in modern times incarnation is synonymous with the conception but some ancient writers such as bede considered incarnation to be synonymous with the nativity the civil or consular year began on january but the diocletian year began on august august in the year before julian leap year there were inaccuracies in the lists of consuls there were confused summations of emperors regnal years it is not known how dionysius established the year of jesus birth two major theories are that dionysius based his calculation on the gospel of luke which states that jesus was about thirty years old shortly after the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar and hence subtracted thirty years from that date or that dionysius counted back years from the first year of his new table it has also been speculated by georges declercq that dionysius desire to replace diocletian years with calendar based on the incarnation of christ was intended to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world at the time it was believed by some that the resurrection of the dead and end of the world would occur years after the birth of jesus the old anno mundi calendar theoretically commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the old testament it was believed that based on the anno mundi calendar jesus was born in the year years after the world was created with the year of the anno mundi calendar marking the end of the world anno mundi approximately ad was thus equated with the end of the world but this date had already passed in the time of dionysius popularization the anglo saxon historian saint venerable bede who was familiar with the work of dionysius exiguus used anno domini dating in his ecclesiastical history of the english people which he completed in ad in the history he also used the latin phrase ante incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo in the sixtieth year before the time of the lord incarnation which is equivalent to the english before christ to identify years before the first year of this era both dionysius and bede regarded anno domini as beginning at the incarnation of jesus christ but the distinction between incarnation and nativity was not drawn until the late th century when in some places the incarnation epoch was identified with christ conception the annunciation on march annunciation style dating statue of charlemagne by agostino cornacchini at st peter basilica vatican city charlemagne promoted the usage of the anno domini epoch throughout the carolingian empire on
