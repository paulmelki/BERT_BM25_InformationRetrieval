his general anglophilia he was also under pressure from his father who became very critical of his educational results heinrich became so fussy that even his wife started to doubt his mental health in heinrich died by drowning in canal by their home in hamburg although it was possible that his death was accidental his wife and son believed that it was suicide because he was very prone to unsociable

children arthur schopenhauer was entitled to control of his part when he reached the age of majority he invested it conservatively in government bonds and earned annual interest that was more than double the salary of university professor schopenhauer as youth arthur spent two years as merchant in honor of his dead father and because of his own doubts about being too old to start life of

burdensome and very hard to live with all your good qualities are overshadowed by your conceit and made useless to the world simply because you cannot restrain your propensity to pick holes in other people arthur left his mother and though she died years later they never met again some negative opinions of the later philosopher about women may be rooted in his troubled relationship with his mother arthur lived in hamburg with his friend jean anthime who was also studying to become merchant after quitting his merchant apprenticeship with some encouragement from his mother he dedicated himself to studies at the ernestine gymnasium gotha in saxe gotha altenburg but he also enjoyed social life among the local nobility spending large amounts of money which caused concern to his frugal mother he left the gymnasium after writing satirical poem about one of the schoolmasters although arthur claimed that he left voluntarily his mother letter indicates that he was expelled education he moved to weimar but didn live with his mother who even tried to discourage him from coming by explaining that they wouldn get along very well their relationship deteriorated even further due to their temperamental differences he accused his mother of being financially irresponsible flirtatious and seeking to remarry which he considered an insult to his father
