in linguistics an affix is morpheme that is attached to word stem to form new word or word form affixes may be derivational like english ness and pre or inflectional like english plural and past tense ed they are bound morphemes by definition prefixes and suffixes may be separable affixes affixation is the linguistic process that speakers use to form different words by adding morphemes at the beginning prefixation the middle infixation or the end suffixation of words positional categories of affixes affixes are divided into many categories depending on their position with reference to the stem prefix and suffix are extremely common terms infix and circumfix are less so as they are not important in european languages the other terms are uncommon categories of affixes affix example schema description prefix un do prefix stem appears before the stem prefixoid semi prefix pseudo prefix flexi cover prefixoid stem appears before the stem but is only partially bound to it suffix postfix look ing stem suffix appears after the stem suffixoid semi suffix pseudo suffix cat like stem suffixoid appears after the stem but is only partially bound to it infix absolutely tmesis stem

text for interlinear glossing as in the third column in the chart above simple affixes such as prefixes and suffixes are separated from the stem with hyphens affixes which disrupt the stem or which themselves are discontinuous are often marked off with angle brackets reduplication is often shown with tilde affixes which cannot be segmented are marked with back slash lexical affixes lexical affixes or semantic affixes are bound elements that appear as affixes but function as incorporated nouns within verbs and as elements of nouns in other words they are similar to word roots stems in function but similar to affixes in form although similar to incorporated nouns lexical affixes differ in that they never occur as freestanding nouns they always appear as affixes lexical affixes are relatively rare the wakashan salishan and chimakuan languages all have lexical suffixes the presence of these is an areal feature of the pacific northwest of north america the lexical suffixes of these languages often show little to no resemblance to free nouns with similar meanings compare the lexical suffixes and free nouns of northern straits saanich written in the saanich orthography and in americanist notation lexical suffix noun aʔ person ełtálṉew ʔəɬtelŋəxʷ person nát net day sȼićel skʷičəl day sen sən foot lower leg sxene sx ənəʔ foot lower leg áwtw ew txʷ building house campsite leṉ ʔeʔləŋ house lexical suffixes when compared with free nouns often have more generic or general meaning for instance one of these languages may have lexical suffix that means water in general sense but it may not have any noun equivalent referring to water in general and instead have several nouns with more specific meaning such saltwater whitewater etc in other cases the lexical suffixes have become grammaticalized to various degrees some linguists have claimed that these lexical suffixes provide only adverbial or adjectival notions to verbs other linguists disagree arguing that they may additionally be syntactic arguments just as free nouns are and thus equating lexical suffixes with incorporated nouns gerdts gives examples of lexical suffixes in the halkomelem language the word order here is verb subject object verb subj obj niʔ šak ət əs łə słeniʔ łə qeq the woman washed the baby verb lex suff subj niʔ šk əyəł łə słeniʔ the woman baby washed in sentence the verb wash is šak ʷətəs where šak is the root and ət and əs are inflectional suffixes the subject the woman is łə słeniʔ and the object the baby is łə qeq in this sentence the baby is free noun the niʔ here is an auxiliary which can be ignored for explanatory purposes in sentence baby does not appear as free noun instead it appears as the lexical suffix əyəł which is affixed to the verb root šk which has changed slightly in pronunciation but this can also be ignored here note how the lexical suffix is neither the baby definite nor baby indefinite such referential changes are routine with incorporated nouns orthographic affixes in orthography the terms for affixes may be used for the smaller elements of conjunct characters for example maya glyphs are generally compounds of main sign and smaller affixes joined at its margins these are called prefixes superfixes postfixes and subfixes according to their position to the left on top to the right or at the bottom of the main glyph small glyph placed inside another is called an infix similar terminology is found with the conjunct consonants of the indic alphabets for example the tibetan alphabet utilizes prefix suffix superfix and subfix
