comparison of various abugidas descended from brahmi script may śiva protect those who take delight in the language of the gods kalidasa an abugida from ge ez አቡጊዳ sometimes known as alphasyllabary neosyllabary or pseudo alphabet is segmental writing system in which consonant vowel sequences are written as unit each unit is based on consonant letter and vowel notation is secondary this contrasts with full alphabet in which vowels have status equal to consonants and with an abjad in which vowel marking is absent partial or optional although in less formal contexts all three types of script may be termed alphabets the terms also contrast them with syllabary in which the symbols cannot be split into separate consonants and vowels related concepts were introduced independently in by james germain février using the term and david diringer using the term semisyllabary then in by fred householder introducing the term pseudo alphabet the ethiopic term abugida was chosen as designation for the concept in by peter daniels in faber suggested segmentally coded syllabically linear phonographic script in bright used the term alphasyllabary and gnanadesikan and rimzhim katz fowler have suggested aksara or āksharik abugidas include the extensive brahmic family of scripts of tibet south and southeast asia semitic ethiopic scripts and canadian aboriginal syllabics as is the case for syllabaries the units of the writing system may consist of the representations both of syllables and of consonants for scripts of the brahmic family the term akshara is used for the units terminology in several languages of ethiopia and eritrea abugida traditionally meant letters of the ethiopic or ge ez script in which many of these languages are written ge ez is one of several segmental writing systems in the world others include indic brahmic scripts and canadian aboriginal syllabics the word abugida is derived from the four letters bu gi and da in much the same way that abecedary is derived from latin letters be ce de abjad is derived from the arabic and alphabet is derived from the names of the two first letters in the greek alphabet alpha and beta abugida as term in linguistics was proposed by peter daniels in his typology of writing systems as daniels used the word an abugida is in contrast with syllabary where letters with shared consonants or vowels show no particular resemblance to one another and also with an alphabet proper where independent letters are used to denote both consonants and vowels the term alphasyllabary was suggested for the indic scripts in by william bright following south asian linguistic usage to convey the idea that they share features of both alphabet and syllabary general description the formal definitions given by daniels and bright for abugida and alphasyllabary differ some writing systems are abugidas but not and some are but not abugidas an abugida is defined as type of writing system whose basic characters denote consonants followed by particular vowel and in which diacritics denote other vowels this particular vowel is referred to as the inherent or implicit vowel as opposed to the explicit vowels marked by the diacritics an alphasyllabary is defined as type of writing system in which the vowels are denoted by subsidiary symbols not all of which occur in linear order with relation to the consonant symbols that is congruent with their temporal order in speech bright did not require that an alphabet explicitly represent all vowels ʼphags pa is an example of an abugida that is not an alphasyllabary and modern lao is an example of an alphasyllabary that is not an abugida for its vowels are always explicit this description is expressed in terms of an abugida formally an alphasyllabary that is not an abugida can be converted to an abugida by adding purely formal vowel sound that is never used and declaring that to be the inherent vowel of the letters representing consonants this may formally make the system ambiguous but in practice this is not problem for then the interpretation with the never used inherent vowel sound will always be wrong interpretation note that the actual pronunciation may be complicated by interactions between the sounds apparently written just as the sounds of the letters in the english words wan gem and war are affected by neighbouring letters the fundamental principles of an abugida apply to words made up of consonant vowel cv syllables the syllables are written as linear sequences of the units of the script each syllable is either letter that represents the sound of consonant and its inherent vowel or letter modified to indicate the vowel either by means of diacritics or by changes in the form of the letter itself if all modifications are by diacritics and all diacritics follow the direction of the writing of the letters then the abugida is not an alphasyllabary however most languages have words that are more complicated than sequence of cv syllables even ignoring tone the first complication is syllables that consist of just vowel this issue does not arise in some languages because every syllable starts with consonant this is common in semitic languages and in languages of mainland se asia for such languages this issue need not arise for some languages zero consonant letter is used as though every syllable began with consonant for other languages each vowel has separate letter that is used for each syllable consisting of just the vowel these letters are known as independent vowels and are found in most indic scripts these letters may be quite different from the corresponding diacritics which by contrast are known as dependent vowels as result of the spread of writing systems independent vowels may be used to represent syllables beginning with glottal stop even for non initial syllables the next two complications are sequences of consonants before vowel ccv and syllables ending in consonant cvc the simplest solution which is not always available is to break with the principle of writing words as sequence of syllables and use unit representing just consonant this
