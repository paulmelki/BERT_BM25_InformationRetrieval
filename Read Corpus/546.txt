the almoravid dynasty al murābiṭūn was an imperial berber muslim dynasty centered in morocco it established an empire in the th century that stretched over the western maghreb and al andalus founded by abdallah ibn yasin the almoravid capital was marrakesh city the ruling house founded in the dynasty originated among the lamtuna and the gudala nomadic berber tribes of the sahara traversing the territory between the draa the niger and the senegal rivers the almoravids were crucial in preventing the fall of al andalus to the iberian christian kingdoms when they decisively defeated coalition of the castilian and aragonese armies at the battle of sagrajas in this enabled them to control an empire that stretched kilometers mi north to south however the rule of the dynasty was relatively short lived the almoravids fell at the height of their power when they failed to stop the masmuda led rebellion initiated by ibn tumart as result their last king ishaq ibn ali was killed in marrakesh in april by the almohad caliphate who replaced them as ruling dynasty both in morocco and al andalus name the term almoravid comes from the arabic al murabit through the the transformation of the in al murabit to the in almorávide is an example of betacism in spanish in arabic al murabit literally means one who is tying but figuratively means one who is ready for battle at fortress the term is related to the notion of ribat north african frontier monastery fortress through the root rabat to tie to unite or raabat to encamp the name almoravid was tied to school of malikite law called dar al murabitin founded in sus al aksa modern day morocco by scholar named waggag ibn zallu ibn zallu sent his student abdallah ibn yasin to preach malikite islam to the sanhaja berbers of the sous and adrar present day mauritania hence the name of the almoravids comes from the followers of the dar al murabitin the house of those who were bound together in the cause of god it is uncertain exactly when or why the almoravids acquired that appellation al bakri writing in before their apex already calls them the al murabitun but does not clarify the reasons for it writing three centuries later ibn abi zar suggested it was chosen early on by abdallah ibn yasin because upon finding resistance among the gudala berbers of adrar mauritania to his teaching he took handful of followers to erect makeshift ribat monastery fortress on an offshore island possibly tidra island in the bay of arguin ibn idhari wrote that the name was suggested by ibn yasin in the persevering in the fight sense to boost morale after particularly hard fought battle in the draa valley in which they had taken many losses whichever explanation is true it seems certain the appellation was chosen by the almoravids for themselves partly with the conscious goal of forestalling any tribal or ethnic identifications the name might be related to the ribat of waggag ibn zallu in the village of aglu near present day tiznit where the future almoravid spiritual leader abdallah ibn yasin got his initial training the th century moroccan biographer ibn al zayyat al tadili and qadi ayyad before him in the th century note that waggag learning center was called dar al murabitin the house of the almoravids and that might have inspired ibn yasin choice of name for the movement contemporaries frequently referred to them as the al mulathimun the veiled ones from litham arabic for veil the almoravids veiled themselves below the eyes with tagelmust custom they adapted from southern sanhaja berbers this can still be seen among the modern tuareg people but it was unusual further north although practical for the desert dust the almoravids insisted on wearing the veil everywhere as badge of foreignness in urban settings partly as way of emphasizing their puritan credentials it served as the uniform of the almoravids under their rule sumptuary laws forbade anybody else from wearing the veil thereby making it the distinctive dress of the ruling class in turn the succeeding almohads made point of mocking the almoravid veil as symbolic of effeminacy and decadence origins the berbers of the tamazgha in the early middle ages could be roughly classified into three major groups the zenata across the north the masmuda concentrated in central morocco and the sanhaja clustered in two areas the western part of the sahara and the hills of the eastern maghreb the eastern sanhaja included the kutama berbers who had been the base of the fatimid rise in the early th century and the zirid dynasty who ruled ifriqiya as vassals of the fatimids after the latter moved to egypt in the western sanhaja were divided into several tribes the gazzula and the lamta in the draa valley and the foothills of the anti atlas range further south encamped in the western sahara were the massufa the lamtuna and the banu warith and most southerly of all the gudala in littoral mauritania down to the borderlands of the senegal river the western sanhaja had been converted to islam some time in the th century they were subsequently united in the th century and with the zeal of new converts launched several campaigns against the sudanese pagan peoples of sub saharan africa under their king tinbarutan ibn usfayshar the sanhaja lamtuna erected or captured the citadel of awdaghust critical stop on the trans saharan trade route after the collapse of the sanhaja union awdagust passed over to the ghana empire and the trans saharan routes were taken over by the zenata maghrawa of sijilmassa the maghrawa also exploited this disunion to dislodge the sanhaja gazzula and lamta out of their pasturelands in the sous and draa valleys around the lamtuna chieftain abu abdallah muhammad ibn tifat alias tarsina tried to reunite the sanhaja desert tribes but his reign lasted less than three years the almoravid empire at its height stretched from the city
