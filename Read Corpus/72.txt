adobe wall detail in bahillo palencia spain renewal of the surface coating of an adobe wall in chamisal new mexico shiraz iran its urban gardens are separated by adobe walls adobe is building material made from earth and organic materials is spanish for mudbrick but in some english speaking regions of spanish heritage the term is used to refer to any kind of earthen construction most adobe buildings are similar in appearance to cob and rammed earth buildings adobe is among the earliest building materials and is used throughout the world description adobe bricks are rectangular prisms small enough that they can quickly air dry individually without cracking they can be subsequently assembled with the application of adobe mud to bond the individual bricks into structure there is no standard size with substantial variations over the years and in different regions in some areas popular size measured weighing about in other contexts the size is weighing about the maximum sizes can reach up to above this weight it becomes difficult to move the pieces and it is preferred to ram the mud in situ resulting in different typology known as rammed earth strength in dry climates adobe structures are extremely durable and account for some of the oldest existing buildings in the world adobe buildings offer significant advantages due to their greater thermal mass but they are known to be particularly susceptible to earthquake damage if they are not reinforced cases where adobe structures were widely damaged during earthquakes include the guatemala earthquake the bam earthquake and the chile earthquake distribution buildings made of sun dried earth are common throughout the world middle east western asia north africa west africa south america southwestern north america spain and eastern europe adobe had been in use by indigenous peoples of the americas in the southwestern united states mesoamerica and the andes for several thousand years puebloan peoples built their adobe structures with handsful or basketsful of adobe until the spanish introduced them to making bricks adobe bricks were used in spain from the late bronze and iron ages eighth century bce onwards its wide use can be attributed to its simplicity of design and manufacture and economics distinction is sometimes made between the smaller adobes which are about the size of ordinary baked bricks and the larger adobines some of which may be one to two yards long etymology church at san pedro de atacama chile the word adobe has existed for around years with relatively little change in either pronunciation or meaning the word can be traced from the middle egyptian bc word ɟbt mud brick middle egyptian evolved into late egyptian demotic or pre coptic and finally to coptic bc where it appeared as τωωβε this was adopted into arabic as aṭ ṭawbu or aṭ ṭūbu with the definite article al attached tuba this was assimilated into the old spanish language as adobe probably via mozarabic english borrowed the word from spanish in the early th century still referring to mudbrick construction in more modern english usage the term adobe has come to include style of architecture popular in the desert climates of north america especially in new mexico regardless of the construction method composition adobe style in santa fe new mexico an adobe brick is composite material made of earth mixed with water and an organic material such as straw or dung the soil composition typically contains sand silt and clay straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly thereby preventing cracking due to uneven shrinkage rates through the brick dung offers the same advantage the most desirable soil texture for producing the mud of adobe is clay silt and fine sand another source quotes clay and the remainder sand and coarser particles up to cobbles with no deleterious effect modern adobe is stabilized with either emulsified asphalt or portland cement up to by weight no more than half the clay content should be expansive clays with the remainder non expansive illite or kaolinite too much expansive clay results in uneven drying through the brick resulting in cracking while too much kaolinite will make weak brick typically the soils of the southwest united states where such construction has been widely used are an adequate composition material properties the great mosque of djenné mali is built in adobe the struts projecting from the wall serve as decoration as well as supports for scaffolding during maintenance adobe walls are load bearing they carry their own weight into the foundation rather than by another structure hence the adobe must have sufficient compressive strength in the united states most building codes call for minimum compressive strength of lbf in newton mm for the adobe block adobe construction should be designed so as to avoid lateral structural loads that would cause bending loads the building codes require the building sustain lateral acceleration earthquake load such an acceleration will cause lateral loads on the walls resulting in shear and bending and inducing tensile stresses to withstand such loads the codes typically call for tensile modulus of rupture strength of at least lbf in newton mm for the finished block in addition to being an inexpensive material with small resource cost adobe can serve as significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction in climates typified by hot days and cool nights the high thermal mass of adobe mediates the high and low temperatures of the day moderating the temperature of the living space the massive walls require large and relatively long input of heat from the sun radiation and from the surrounding air convection before they warm through to the interior after the sun sets and the temperature drops the warm wall will continue to transfer heat to the interior for several hours due to the time lag effect thus well planned adobe wall of the appropriate thickness is very effective at controlling inside temperature through the wide daily
