the articles of confederation and perpetual union was an agreement among the original states of the united states of america that served as its first constitution it was approved after much debate between july and november by the second continental congress on november and sent to the states for ratification the articles of confederation came into force on march after being ratified by all states guiding principle of the articles was to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states the weak central government established by the articles received only those powers which the former colonies had recognized as belonging to king and parliament the document provided clearly written rules for how the states league of friendship would be organized during the ratification process the congress looked to the articles for guidance as it conducted business directing the war effort conducting diplomacy with foreign states addressing territorial issues and dealing with native american relations little changed politically once the articles of confederation went into effect as ratification did little more than legalize what the continental congress had been doing that body was renamed the congress of the confederation but most americans continued to call it the continental congress since its organization remained the same as the confederation congress attempted to govern the continually growing american states delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered it ineffective at doing so as the government weaknesses became apparent especially after shays rebellion some prominent political thinkers in the fledgling union began asking for changes to the articles their hope was to create stronger government initially some states met to deal with their trade and economic problems however as more states became interested in meeting to change the articles meeting was set in philadelphia on may this became the constitutional convention it was quickly agreed that changes would not work and instead the entire articles needed to be replaced on march the government under the articles was replaced with the federal government under the constitution the new constitution provided for much stronger federal government by establishing chief executive the president courts and taxing powers background and context the political push to increase cooperation among the then loyal colonies began with the albany congress in and benjamin franklin proposed albany plan an inter colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems over the next two decades some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen others would weaken especially in the degree of loyalty or lack thereof owed the crown civil disobedience resulted in coercive and quelling measures such as the passage of what the colonials referred to as the intolerable acts in the british parliament and armed skirmishes which resulted in dissidents being proclaimed rebels these actions eroded the number of crown loyalists tories among the colonials and together with the highly effective propaganda campaign of the patriot leaders caused an increasing number of colonists to begin agitating for independence from the mother country in with events outpacing communications the second continental congress began acting as the provisional government it was an era of constitution writing most states were busy at the task and leaders felt the new nation must have written constitution rulebook for how the new nation should function during the war congress exercised an unprecedented level of political diplomatic military and economic authority it adopted trade restrictions established and maintained an army issued fiat money created military code and negotiated with foreign governments to transform themselves from outlaws into legitimate nation the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it in early thomas paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of common sense that the custom of nations demanded formal declaration of american independence if any european power were to mediate peace between the americans and great britain the monarchies of france and spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch foreign courts needed to have american grievances laid before them persuasively in manifesto which could also reassure them that the americans would be reliable trading partners without such declaration paine concluded the custom of all courts is against us and will be so until by an independence we take rank with other nations beyond improving their existing association the records of the second continental congress show that the need for declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations on june richard henry lee introduced resolution before the continental congress declaring the colonies independent at the same time he also urged congress to resolve to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign alliances and to prepare plan of confederation for the newly independent states congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the declaration model treaty and the articles of
