alain de lille alan of lille latin alanus ab insulis was french theologian and poet he was born in lille some time before his exact date of death remains unclear as well with most research pointing toward it being between april and april life little is known of his life alain entered the schools no earlier than the late first attending the school at paris and then at chartres he probably studied under masters such as peter abelard gilbert of poitiers and thierry of chartres this is known through the writings of john of salisbury who is thought to have been contemporary student of alain of lille his earliest writings were probably written in the and probably in paris alain spent many years as professor of theology at the university of paris and he attended the lateran council in though the only accounts of his lectures seem to show sort of eccentric style and approach he was said to have been good friends with many other masters at the school in paris and taught there as well as some time in southern france into his old age he afterwards inhabited montpellier he is sometimes called alanus de montepessulano lived for time outside the walls of any cloister and finally retired to cîteaux where he died in he had very widespread reputation during his lifetime and his knowledge caused him to be called doctor universalis many of alain writings are unable to be exactly dated and the circumstances and details surrounding his writing are often unknown as well however it does seem clear that his first notable work summa quoniam homines was completed somewhere between and with the most conclusive date being and was probably developed through his lectures at the school in paris among his very numerous works two poems entitle him to distinguished place in the latin literature of the middle ages one of these the de planctu naturae is an ingenious satire on the vices of humanity he created the allegory of grammatical conjugation which was to have its successors throughout the middle ages the anticlaudianus treatise on morals as allegory the form of which recalls the pamphlet of claudian against rufinus is agreeably versified and relatively pure in its latinity theology and philosophy as theologian alain de lille shared in the mystic reaction of the second half of the th century against the scholastic philosophy his mysticism however is far from being as absolute as that of the victorines in the anticlaudianus he sums up as follows reason guided by prudence can unaided discover most of the truths of the physical order for the apprehension of religious truths it must trust to faith this rule is completed in his treatise ars catholicae fidei as follows theology itself may be demonstrated by reason alain even ventures an immediate application of this principle and tries to prove geometrically the dogmas defined in the creed this bold attempt is entirely factitious and verbal and it is only his employment of various terms not generally used in such connection axiom theorem corollary etc that gives his treatise its apparent originality alan philosophy was sort of mixture of aristotelian logic and neoplatonic philosophy the platonist seemed to outweigh the aristotelian in alan but he felt strongly that the divine is all intelligibility and argued this notion through much aristotelian logic combined with pythagorean mathematics works and attributions one of alain most notable works was one he modeled after boethius consolation of philosophy to which he gave the title de planctu naturae or the plaint of nature and which was most likely written in the late in this work alan uses prose and verse to illustrate the way in which nature defines its own position as inferior to that of god he also attempts to illustrate the way in which humanity through sexual perversion and specifically homosexuality has defiled itself from nature and god in anticlaudianus another of his notable works alan uses poetical dialogue to illustrate the way in which nature comes to the realization of her failure in producing the perfect man she has only the ability to create soulless body and thus she is persuaded to undertake the journey to heaven to ask for soul and the seven liberal arts produce chariot for her the five senses are the horses the anticlaudianus was translated into french and german in the following century and toward was re worked into musical anthology by adam de la bassée one of alan most popular and widely distributed works is his manual on preaching ars praedicandi or the art of preaching this work shows how alan saw theological education as being fundamental preliminary step in preaching and strove to give clergyman manuscript to be used as practical manual when it came to the formation of sermons and art of preaching alain wrote three very large theological textbooks one being his first work summa quoniam homines another of his theological textbooks that strove to be more minute in its focus is his de fide catholica dated somewhere between and alan sets out to refute heretical views specifically that of the waldensians and cathars in his third theological textbook regulae caelestis iuris he presents set of what seems to be theological rules this was typical of the followers of gilbert of poitiers of which alan could be associated other than these theological textbooks and the aforementioned works of the mixture of prose and poetry alan of lille had numerous other works on numerous subjects primarily including speculative theology theoretical moral theology practical moral theology and various collections of poems alain de lille has often been confounded with other persons named alain in particular with another alanus alain bishop of auxerre alan abbot of tewkesbury alain de podio etc certain facts of their lives have been attributed to him as well as some of their works thus the life of st bernard should be ascribed to alain of auxerre and the commentary upon merlin to alan of tewkesbury
