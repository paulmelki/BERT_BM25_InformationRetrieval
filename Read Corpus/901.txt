staghound armored car of world war ii lapv enok modern armored car of the german army military armored or armoured car is lightweight wheeled armored fighting vehicle historically employed for reconnaissance internal security armed escort and other subordinate battlefield tasks with the gradual decline of mounted cavalry armored cars were developed for carrying out duties formerly assigned to light cavalry following the invention of the tank the armored car remained popular due to its faster speed comparatively simplified maintenance and low production cost it also found favor with several colonial armies as cheaper weapon for use in underdeveloped regions during world war ii most armored cars were engineered for reconnaissance and passive observation while others were devoted to communications tasks some equipped with heavier armament could even substitute for tracked combat vehicles in favorable conditions such as pursuit or flanking maneuvers during the north african campaign since world war ii the traditional functions of the armored car have been occasionally combined with that of the armored personnel carrier resulting in such multipurpose designs as the btr or the cadillac gage commando postwar advances in recoil control technology have also made it possible for few armored cars including the centauro the amx rc and ee cascavel to carry large cannon capable of threatening many tanks history hussite war wagons th century precursors during the middle ages war wagons covered with steel plate and crewed by men armed with primitive hand cannon flails and muskets were used by the hussite rebels in bohemia these were deployed in formations where the horses and oxen were at the centre and the surrounding wagons were chained together as protection from enemy cavalry similar wagons were used by the english army of henry viii and by the chinese empire with the invention of the steam engine victorian inventors designed prototype self propelled armored vehicles for use in sieges although none were deployed in combat wells short story the land ironclads provides fictionalised account of their use armed car simms motor scout built in as an armed car the motor scout was designed and built by british inventor simms in it was the first armed petrol engine powered vehicle ever built the vehicle was de dion bouton quadricycle with mounted maxim machine gun on the front bar an iron shield in front of the car protected the driver another early armed car was invented by royal page davidson at northwestern military and naval academy in with the davidson duryea gun carriage and the later davidson automobile battery armored car however these were not armored cars as the term is understood today as they provided little or no protection for their crews from enemy fire they were also by virtue of their small capacity engines less efficient than the cavalry and horse drawn guns that they were intended to complement first armored cars at the beginning of the th century the first military armored vehicles were manufactured by adding armor and weapons to existing vehicles simms motor war car the first armored car to be built the first armored car was the simms motor war car designed by simms and built by vickers sons maxim of barrow on special coventry built daimler chassis with german built daimler motor in and single prototype was ordered in april the prototype was finished in too late to be used during the boer war the vehicle had vickers armour mm thick and was powered by four cylinder litre hp cannstatt daimler engine giving it maximum speed around the armament consisting of two maxim guns was carried in two turrets with traverse it had crew of four simms motor war car was presented at the crystal palace london in april the earliest french armored car the charron girardot voigt another early armored car of the period was the french charron girardot et voigt presented at the salon de automobile et du cycle in brussels on march the vehicle was equipped with hotchkiss machine gun and with mm armour for the gunner one of the first operational armoured cars with four wheel drive and partly enclosed rotating turret was the austro daimler panzerwagen built by austro daimler in it was armoured with mm thick curved plates over the body drive space and engine and had mm thick dome shaped rotating turret that housed one or two machine guns it had cylinder hp litre engine giving it average cross country performance of note both the driver and co driver had adjustable seats enabling them to raise them to see out of the roof of the drive compartment as needed austro daimler four wheel drive armoured car the italians used armored cars during the italo turkish war great variety of armored cars appeared on both sides during world war and these were used in various ways world war generally armored cars were used by more or less independent car commanders however sometimes they were used in larger units up to squadron size the cars were primarily armed with light machine guns but larger units usually employed few cars with heavier guns as air power became factor armored cars offered mobile platform for antiaircraft guns belgium minerva armored car rolls royce armoured car pattern the first effective use of an armored vehicle in combat was achieved by the belgian army in august september they had placed cockerill armour plating and hotchkiss machine gun on minerva touring cars creating the minerva armored car their successes in the early days of the war convinced the belgian ghq to create corps of armoured cars who would be sent to fight on the eastern front once the western front immobilized after the battle of the yser the british royal naval air service dispatched aircraft to dunkirk to defend the uk from zeppelins the officers cars followed them and these began to be used to rescue downed reconnaissance pilots in the battle areas they mounted machine guns on them and as these excursions became increasingly dangerous they improvised boiler plate armoring on
