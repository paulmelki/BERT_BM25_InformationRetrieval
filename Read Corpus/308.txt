the combined area of these three shapes is approximately squares area is the quantity that expresses the extent of two dimensional figure or shape or planar lamina in the plane surface area is its analog on the two dimensional surface of three dimensional object area can be understood as the amount of material with given thickness that would be necessary to fashion model of the shape or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with single coat it is the two dimensional analog of the length of curve one dimensional concept or the volume of solid three dimensional concept the area of shape can be measured by comparing the shape to squares of fixed size in the international system of units si the standard unit of area is the square metre written as which is the area of square whose sides are one metre long shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares in mathematics the unit square is defined to have area one and the area of any other shape or surface is dimensionless real number there are several well known formulas for the areas of simple shapes such as triangles rectangles and circles using these formulas the area of any polygon can be found by dividing the polygon into triangles for shapes with curved boundary calculus is usually required to compute the area indeed the problem of determining the area of plane figures was major motivation for the historical development of calculus for solid shape such as sphere cone or cylinder the area of its boundary surface is called the surface area formulas for the surface areas of simple shapes were computed by the ancient greeks but computing the surface area of more complicated shape usually requires multivariable calculus area plays an important role in modern mathematics in addition to its obvious importance in geometry and calculus area is related to the definition of determinants in linear algebra and is basic property of surfaces in differential geometry in analysis the area of subset of the plane is defined using lebesgue measure though not every subset is measurable in general area in higher mathematics is seen as special case of volume for two dimensional regions area can be defined through the use of axioms defining it as function of collection of certain plane figures to the set of real numbers it can be proved that such function exists formal definition an approach to defining what is meant by area is through axioms area can be defined as function from collection of special kind of plane figures termed measurable sets to the set of real numbers which satisfies the following properties for all in if and are in then so are and and also if and are in with then is in and if set is in and is congruent to then is also in and every rectangle is in if the rectangle has length and breadth then hk let be set enclosed between two step regions and step region is formed from finite union of adjacent rectangles resting on common base if there is unique number such that for all such step regions and then it can be proved that such an area function actually exists units square metre quadrat made of pvc pipe every unit of length has corresponding unit of area namely the area of square with the given side length thus areas can be measured in square metres square centimetres cm square millimetres mm square kilometres km square feet ft square yards yd square miles mi and so forth algebraically these units can be thought of as the squares of the corresponding length units the si unit of area is the square metre which is considered an si derived unit conversions although there are mm in cm there are mm in cm calculation of the area of square whose length and width are metre would be metre metre and so rectangle with different sides say length of metres and width of metres would have an area in square units that can be calculated as metres metres this is equivalent to million square millimetres other useful conversions are square kilometre square metres square metre square centimetres square millimetres square centimetre square millimetres non metric units in non metric units the conversion between two square units is the square of the conversion between the corresponding length units foot inches the relationship between square feet and square inches is square foot square inches where similarly square yard square feet square mile square yards square feet in addition conversion factors include square inch square centimetres square foot square metres square yard square metres square mile square kilometres other units including historical there are several other common units for area the are was the original unit of area in the metric system with are square metres though the are has fallen out of use the hectare is still commonly used to measure land hectare ares square metres square kilometres other uncommon metric units of area include the tetrad the hectad and the myriad the acre is also commonly used to measure land areas where acre square yards square feet an acre is approximately of hectare on the atomic scale area is measured in units of barns such that barn square meters the barn is commonly used in describing the cross sectional area of interaction in nuclear physics in india dhurki dhur dhur khatha khata bigha khata acre history circle area in the th century bce hippocrates of chios was the first to show that the area of disk the region enclosed by circle is proportional to the square of its diameter as part of his quadrature of the lune of hippocrates but did not identify the constant of proportionality eudoxus of cnidus also in the th century bce also found that the area of disk is proportional to its radius squared subsequently book of euclid elements dealt with equality of
