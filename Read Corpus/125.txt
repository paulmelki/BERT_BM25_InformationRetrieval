universities and is used to varying degrees in workplaces government and the media arabic in its standard form is the official language of states as well as the liturgical language of the religion of islam since the quran and hadith were written in arabic during the middle ages arabic was major vehicle of culture in europe especially in science mathematics and philosophy as result many european languages have also borrowed many words from it arabic influence mainly in vocabulary is seen in european languages mainly spanish and to lesser extent portuguese and catalan owing to both the proximity of christian european and muslim arab civilizations and the long lasting arabic culture and language presence mainly in southern iberia during the al andalus era sicilian has about arabic words many of which relate to agriculture and related activities as legacy of the emirate of sicily from the early th to late th centuries while maltese language is semitic language developed from dialect of arabic and written in the latin alphabet the balkan languages including greek and bulgarian have also acquired significant number of arabic words through contact with ottoman turkish arabic has influenced many other languages around the globe throughout its history some of the most influenced languages are persian turkish hindustani hindi and urdu kashmiri kurdish bosnian kazakh bengali malay indonesian and malaysian maldivian pashto punjabi albanian armenian azerbaijani sicilian spanish greek bulgarian tagalog sindhi odia and hausa and some languages in parts of africa conversely

of billion muslims and arabic is one of six official languages of the united nations all varieties of arabic combined are spoken by perhaps as many as million speakers native and non native in the arab world making it the fifth most spoken language in the world arabic is written with the arabic alphabet which is an abjad script and is written from right to left although the spoken varieties are sometimes written in ascii latin from left to right with no standardized orthography classification arabic is usually but not universally classified as central semitic language it is related to languages in other subgroups of the semitic language group northwest semitic south semitic east semitic west semitic such as aramaic syriac hebrew ugaritic phoenician canaanite amorite ammonite eblaite epigraphic ancient north arabian epigraphic ancient south arabian ethiopic modern south arabian and numerous other dead and modern languages linguists still differ as to the best classification of semitic language sub groups the semitic languages changed great deal between proto semitic and the emergence of the central semitic languages particularly in grammar innovations of the central semitic languages all maintained in arabic include the conversion of the suffix conjugated stative formation jalas into past tense the conversion of the prefix conjugated preterite tense formation yajlis into present tense the elimination of other prefix conjugated mood aspect forms present tense formed by doubling the middle root perfect formed by infixing after the first root consonant probably jussive formed by stress shift in favor of new moods formed by endings attached to the prefix conjugation forms for indicative for subjunctive no ending for jussive an or anna for energetic the development of an internal passive there are several features which classical arabic the modern arabic varieties as well as the safaitic and hismaic inscriptions share which are unattested in any other central semitic language variety including the dadanitic and taymanitic languages of the northern hejaz these features are evidence of common descent from hypothetical ancestor proto arabic the following features can be reconstructed with confidence for proto arabic negative particles to classical arabic passive participle prepositions and adverbs subjunctive in demonstratives leveling of the allomorph of the feminine ending complementizer and subordinator the use of to introduce modal clauses independent object pronoun in vestiges of nunation history old arabic safaitic inscription arabia boasted wide variety of semitic languages in antiquity in the southwest various central semitic languages both belonging to and outside of the ancient south arabian family southern thamudic were spoken it is also believed that the ancestors of the modern south arabian languages non central semitic languages were also spoken in southern arabia at this time to the north in the oases of northern hejaz dadanitic and taymanitic held some prestige as inscriptional languages in najd and parts of western arabia language known to scholars as thamudic is attested in eastern arabia inscriptions in script derived from asa attest to language known as hasaitic finally on the northwestern frontier of arabia various languages known to scholars as thamudic thamudic safaitic and hismaic are attested the last two share important isoglosses with later forms of arabic leading scholars to theorize that safaitic and hismaic are in fact early forms of arabic and that they should be considered old arabic linguists generally believe that old arabic collection of related dialects that constitute the precursor of arabic first emerged around the st century ce previously the earliest attestation of old arabic was thought to be single st century ce inscription in sabaic script at qaryat al faw
