in mathematics the associative property is property of some binary operations which means that rearranging the parentheses in an expression will not change the result in propositional logic associativity is valid rule of replacement for expressions in logical proofs within an expression containing two or more occurrences in row of the same associative operator the order in which the operations are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed that is after rewriting the expression with parentheses and in infix notation if necessary rearranging the parentheses in such an expression will not change its value consider the following equations even though the parentheses were rearranged on each line the values of the expressions were not altered since this holds true when performing addition and multiplication on any real numbers it can be said that addition and multiplication of real numbers are associative operations associativity is not the same as commutativity which addresses whether or not the order of two operands changes the result for example the order does not matter in the multiplication of real numbers that is so we say that the multiplication of real numbers is commutative operation associative operations are abundant in mathematics in fact many algebraic structures such as semigroups and categories explicitly require their binary operations to be associative however many important and interesting operations are non associative some examples include subtraction exponentiation and the vector cross product in contrast to the theoretical properties of real numbers the addition of floating point numbers in computer science is not associative and the choice of how to associate an expression can have significant effect on rounding error definition this diagram commutes that is when the two paths from to compose to the same function from to formally binary operation on set is called associative if it satisfies the associative law for all in here is used to replace the symbol of the operation which may be any symbol and even the absence of symbol juxtaposition as for multiplication xy yz xyz for all in the associative law can also be expressed in functional notation thus generalized associative law in the absence of the associative property five factors result in tamari lattice of order four possibly different products if binary operation is associative repeated application of the operation produces the same result regardless of how valid pairs of parentheses are inserted in the expression this is called the generalized associative law for instance product of four elements may be written without changing the order of the factors in five possible ways if the product operation is associative the generalized associative law says that all these formulas will yield the same result so unless the formula with omitted parentheses already has different meaning see below the parentheses can be considered unnecessary and the product can be written unambiguously as as the number of elements increases the number of possible ways to insert parentheses grows quickly but they remain unnecessary for disambiguation an example where this does not work is the logical biconditional it is associative thus bc is equivalent to ab but abc most commonly means ab and bc which is not equivalent examples in associative operations is the addition of real numbers is associative some examples of associative operations include the following the concatenation of the three strings hello world can be computed by concatenating the first two strings giving hello and appending the third string world or by joining the second and third string giving world and concatenating the first string hello with the result the two methods produce the same result string concatenation is associative but not commutative in arithmetic addition and multiplication of real numbers are associative because of associativity the grouping parentheses can be omitted without ambiguity the trivial operation that is the result is the first argument no matter what the second argument is is associative but not commutative likewise the trivial operation that is the result is the second argument no matter what the first argument is is associative but not commutative addition and multiplication of complex numbers and quaternions are associative addition of octonions is also associative but multiplication of octonions is non associative the greatest common divisor and least common multiple functions act associatively taking the intersection or the union of sets if is some set and denotes the set of all functions from to then the operation of function composition on is associative slightly more generally given four sets and with to to and to then as before in short composition of maps is always associative consider set with three elements and the following operation is associative thus for example bc ab this operation is not commutative because matrices represent linear functions and matrix multiplication represents function composition one can immediately conclude that matrix multiplication is associative propositional logic rule of replacement in standard truth functional propositional logic association or associativity are two valid rules of replacement the rules allow one to move parentheses in logical expressions in logical proofs the rules using logical connectives notation are and where is metalogical symbol representing can be replaced in proof with truth functional connectives associativity is property of some logical connectives of truth functional propositional logic the following logical equivalences demonstrate that associativity is property of particular connectives the following are truth functional tautologies associativity of disjunction associativity of conjunction associativity of equivalence joint denial is an example of truth functional connective that is not associative non associative operation binary operation on set that does not satisfy the associative law is called non associative symbolically for such an operation the order of evaluation does matter for example subtraction division exponentiation also note that infinite sums are not generally associative for example whereas the study of non associative structures arises from reasons somewhat different from the mainstream of classical algebra one area within non associative algebra that has grown very large is that of lie algebras there the associative law is replaced by the jacobi
