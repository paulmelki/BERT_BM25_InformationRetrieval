americium is synthetic radioactive chemical element with the symbol am and atomic number it is transuranic member of the actinide series in the periodic table located under the lanthanide element europium and thus by analogy was named after the americas americium was first produced in by the group of glenn seaborg from berkeley california at the metallurgical laboratory of the university of chicago part of the manhattan project although it is the third element in the transuranic series it was discovered fourth after the heavier curium the discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in november most americium is produced by uranium or plutonium being bombarded with neutrons in nuclear reactors one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about grams of americium it is widely used in commercial ionization chamber smoke detectors as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges several unusual applications such as nuclear batteries or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion have been proposed for the isotope mam but they are as yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer americium is relatively soft radioactive metal with silvery appearance its common isotopes are am and am in chemical compounds americium usually assumes the oxidation state especially in solutions several other oxidation states are known ranging from to and can be identified by their characteristic optical absorption spectra the crystal lattice of solid americium and its compounds contain small intrinsic radiogenic defects due to metamictization induced by self irradiation with alpha particles which accumulates with time this can cause drift of some material properties over time more noticeable in older samples history the inch cyclotron at the lawrence radiation laboratory university of california berkeley in august the triangle in the glass tube contains the first sample of americium as the hydroxide am oh produced in although americium was likely produced in previous nuclear experiments it was first intentionally synthesized isolated and identified in late autumn at the university of california berkeley by glenn seaborg leon morgan ralph james and albert ghiorso they used inch cyclotron at the university of california berkeley the element was chemically identified at the metallurgical laboratory now argonne national laboratory of the university of chicago following the lighter neptunium plutonium and heavier curium americium was the fourth transuranium element to be discovered at the time the periodic table had been restructured by seaborg to its present layout containing the actinide row below the lanthanide one this led to americium being located right below its twin lanthanide element europium it was thus by analogy named after the americas the name americium after the americas and the symbol am are suggested for the element on the basis of its position as the sixth member of the actinide rare earth series analogous to europium eu of the lanthanide series the new element was isolated from its oxides in complex multi step process first plutonium nitrate puno solution was coated on platinum foil of about cm area the solution was evaporated and the residue was converted into plutonium dioxide puo by calcining after cyclotron irradiation the coating was dissolved with nitric acid and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous ammonia solution the residue was dissolved in perchloric acid further separation was carried out by ion exchange yielding certain isotope of curium the separation of curium and americium was so painstaking that those elements were initially called by the berkeley group as pandemonium from greek for all demons or hell and delirium from latin for madness initial experiments yielded four americium isotopes am am am and am americium was directly obtained from plutonium upon absorption of two neutrons it decays by emission of particle to np the half life of this decay was first determined as years but then corrected to years the times are half lives the second isotope am was produced upon neutron bombardment of the already created am upon rapid decay am converts into the isotope of curium cm which had been discovered previously the half life of this decay was initially determined at hours which was close to the presently accepted value of the discovery of americium and curium in was closely related to the manhattan project the results were confidential and declassified only in seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements and on the radio show for children quiz kids five days before the official presentation at an american chemical society meeting on november when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and neptunium had been discovered during the war after the discovery of americium isotopes am and am their production and compounds were patented listing only seaborg as the inventor the initial americium samples weighed few micrograms they were barely visible and were identified by their radioactivity the first substantial amounts of metallic americium weighing micrograms were not prepared until by reduction of americium iii fluoride with barium metal in high vacuum at occurrence americium was detected in the fallout from the ivy mike nuclear test the longest lived and most common isotopes of americium am and am have half lives of and years respectively therefore any primordial americium americium that was present on earth during its formation should have decayed by now trace amounts of americium probably occur naturally in uranium minerals as result of nuclear reactions though this has not been confirmed existing americium is concentrated in the areas used for the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests conducted between and as well as at the sites of nuclear incidents such as the chernobyl disaster for example the analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first hydrogen bomb ivy mike november enewetak atoll revealed high concentrations of various actinides including americium but due to military secrecy this result was not published until later in trinitite the glassy residue left on the desert floor near alamogordo new mexico after the plutonium based trinity nuclear bomb test on july contains traces of americium
