ataxia is neurological sign consisting of lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements that can include gait abnormality speech changes and abnormalities in eye movements ataxia is clinical manifestation indicating dysfunction of the parts of the nervous system that coordinate movement such as the cerebellum ataxia can be limited to one side of the body which is referred to as hemiataxia several possible causes exist for these patterns of neurological dysfunction dystaxia is mild degree of ataxia friedreich ataxia has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom the word is from greek negative prefix τάξις order lack of order types cerebellar the term cerebellar ataxia is used to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum the cerebellum is responsible for integrating significant amount of neural information that is used to coordinate smoothly ongoing movements and to participate in motor planning although ataxia is not present with all cerebellar lesions many conditions affecting the cerebellum do produce ataxia people with cerebellar ataxia may have trouble regulating the force range direction velocity and rhythm of muscle contractions this results in characteristic type of irregular uncoordinated movement that can manifest itself in many possible ways such as asthenia asynergy delayed reaction time and dyschronometria individuals with cerebellar ataxia could also display instability of gait difficulty with eye movements dysarthria dysphagia hypotonia dysmetria and these deficits can vary depending on which cerebellar structures have been damaged and whether the lesion is bi or unilateral people with cerebellar ataxia may initially present with poor balance which could be demonstrated as an inability to stand on one leg or perform tandem gait as the condition progresses walking is characterized by widened base and high stepping as well as staggering and lurching from side to side turning is also problematic and could result in falls as cerebellar ataxia becomes severe great assistance and effort are needed to stand and walk dysarthria an impairment with articulation may also be present and is characterized by scanning speech that consists of slower rate irregular rhythm and variable volume also slurring of speech tremor of the voice and ataxic respiration may occur cerebellar ataxia could result with incoordination of movement particularly in the extremities overshooting or hypermetria occurs with finger to nose testing and heel to shin testing thus dysmetria is evident impairments with alternating movements as well as dysrhythmia may also be displayed tremor of the head and trunk titubation may be seen in individuals with cerebellar ataxia dysmetria is thought to be caused by deficit in the control of interaction torques in multijoint motion interaction torques are created at an associated joint when the primary joint is moved for example if movement required reaching to touch target in front of the body flexion at the shoulder would create torque at the elbow while extension of the elbow would create torque at the wrist these torques increase as the speed of movement increases and must be compensated and adjusted for to create coordinated movement this may therefore explain decreased coordination at higher movement velocities and accelerations dysfunction of the flocculonodular lobe impairs balance and the control of eye movements this presents itself with postural instability in which the person tends to separate his her feet upon standing to gain wider base and to avoid titubation bodily oscillations tending to be forward backward ones the instability is therefore worsened when standing with the feet together regardless of whether the eyes are open or closed this is negative romberg test or more accurately it denotes the individual inability to carry out the test because the individual feels unstable even with open eyes dysfunction of the spinocerebellum vermis and associated areas near the midline presents itself with wide based drunken sailor gait called truncal ataxia characterised by uncertain starts and stops lateral deviations and unequal steps as result of this gait impairment falling is concern in patients with ataxia studies examining falls in this population show that of patients have fallen at least once in the past year and up to admit to fear of falling dysfunction of the lateral hemispheres presents as disturbances in carrying out voluntary planned movements by the extremities called appendicular ataxia these include intention tremor coarse trembling accentuated over the execution of voluntary movements possibly involving the head and eyes as well as the limbs and torso peculiar writing abnormalities large unequal letters irregular underlining peculiar pattern of dysarthria slurred speech sometimes characterised by explosive variations in voice intensity despite regular rhythm inability to perform rapidly alternating movements known as occurs and could involve rapidly switching from pronation to supination of the forearm movements become more irregular with increases of speed inability to judge distances or ranges of movement happens this dysmetria is often seen as undershooting hypometria or overshooting hypermetria the required distance or range to reach target this is sometimes seen when patient is asked to reach out and touch someone finger or touch his or her own nose the rebound phenomenon also known as the loss of the check reflex is also sometimes seen in patients with cerebellar ataxia for example when patients are flexing their elbows isometrically against resistance when the resistance is suddenly removed without warning the patients arms may swing up and even strike themselves with an intact check reflex the patients check and activate the opposing triceps to slow and stop the movement patients may exhibit constellation of subtle to overt cognitive symptoms which are gathered under the terminology of schmahmann syndrome sensory the term sensory ataxia is used to indicate ataxia due to loss of proprioception the loss of sensitivity to the positions of joint and body parts this is generally caused by dysfunction of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord because they carry proprioceptive information up to the brain in some cases the cause of sensory ataxia may instead be dysfunction of the various parts of the brain that receive positional information including the cerebellum thalamus and parietal lobes sensory ataxia presents itself with an unsteady
