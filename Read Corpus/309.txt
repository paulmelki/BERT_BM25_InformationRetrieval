the astronomical unit symbol au or au is unit of length roughly the distance from earth to the sun and equal to about or light seconds the actual distance varies as earth orbits the sun from maximum aphelion to minimum perihelion and back again once each year the au was originally conceived as the average of earth aphelion and perihelion however since it has been defined as exactly the astronomical unit is used primarily for measuring distances within the solar system or around other stars it is also fundamental component in the definition of another unit of astronomical length the parsec history of symbol usage variety of unit symbols and abbreviations have been in use for the astronomical unit in resolution the international astronomical union iau had used the symbol to denote length equal to the astronomical unit in the astronomical literature the symbol au was and remains common in the international bureau of weights and measures bipm had recommended ua as the symbol for the unit in the non normative annex to iso the symbol of the astronomical unit is ua in the iau noting that various symbols are presently in use for the astronomical unit recommended the use of the symbol au the scientific journals published by the american astronomical society and the royal astronomical society subsequently adopted this symbol in the revision and edition of the si brochure the bipm used the unit symbol au iso which replaces iso does not mention the astronomical unit development of unit definition earth orbit around the sun is an ellipse the semi major axis of this elliptic orbit is defined to be half of the straight line segment that joins the perihelion and aphelion the centre of the sun lies on this straight line segment but not at its midpoint because ellipses are well understood shapes measuring the points of its extremes defined the exact shape mathematically and made possible calculations for the entire orbit as well as predictions based on observation in addition it mapped out exactly the largest straight line distance that earth traverses over the course of year defining times and places for observing the largest parallax apparent shifts of position in nearby stars knowing earth shift and star shift enabled the star distance to be calculated but all measurements are subject to some degree of error or uncertainty and the uncertainties in the length of the astronomical unit only increased uncertainties in the stellar distances improvements in precision have always been key to improving astronomical understanding throughout the twentieth century measurements became increasingly precise and sophisticated and ever more dependent on accurate observation of the effects described by einstein theory of relativity and upon the mathematical tools it used improving measurements were continually checked and cross checked by means of improved understanding of the laws of celestial mechanics which govern the motions of objects in space the expected positions and distances of objects at an established time are calculated in au from these laws and assembled into collection of data called an ephemeris nasa jet propulsion laboratory horizons system provides one of several ephemeris computation services in in order to establish yet more precise measure for the astronomical unit the iau formally adopted new definition although directly based on the then best available observational measurements the definition was recast in terms of the then best mathematical derivations from celestial mechanics and planetary ephemerides it stated that the astronomical unit of length is that length for which the gaussian gravitational constant takes the value when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length mass and time equivalently by this definition one au is the radius of an unperturbed circular newtonian orbit about the sun of particle having infinitesimal mass moving with an angular frequency of or alternatively that length for which the heliocentric gravitational constant the product is equal to au when the length is used to describe the positions of objects in the solar system subsequent explorations of the solar system by space probes made it possible to obtain precise measurements of the relative positions of the inner planets and other objects by means of radar and telemetry as with all radar measurements these rely on measuring the time taken for photons to be reflected from an object because all photons move at the speed of light in vacuum fundamental constant of the universe the distance of an object from the probe is calculated as the product of the speed of light and the measured time however for precision the calculations require adjustment for things such as the motions of the probe and object while the photons are transiting in addition the measurement of the time itself must be translated to standard scale that accounts for relativistic time dilation comparison of the ephemeris positions with time measurements expressed in barycentric dynamical time tdb leads to value for the speed of light in astronomical units per day of by the iau had updated its standard measures to reflect improvements and calculated the speed of light at tdb in the cipm modified the international system of units si or modern metric system to make the metre defined as the distance travelled in vacuum by light in second this replaced the previous definition valid between and which was that the metre equalled certain number of wavelengths of certain emission line of krypton the reason for the change was an improved method of measuring the speed of light the speed of light could then be expressed exactly as standard also adopted by the iers numerical standards from this definition and the iau standard the time for light to traverse an astronomical unit is found to be which is slightly more than minutes seconds by multiplication the best iau estimate was based on comparison of jet propulsion laboratory and iaa ras ephemerides in the bipm reported value of the astronomical unit as in the revision of the si brochure the bipm recognised the iau redefinition of the astronomical unit
