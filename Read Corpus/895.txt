sir arthur stanley eddington december november was an english astronomer physicist and mathematician he was also philosopher of science and populariser of science the eddington limit the natural limit to the luminosity of stars or the radiation generated by accretion onto compact object is named in his honour around he anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars in his paper the internal constitution of the stars at that time the source of stellar energy was complete mystery eddington was the first to correctly speculate that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium eddington wrote number of articles that announced and explained einstein theory of general relativity to the english speaking world world war had severed many lines of scientific communication and new developments in german science were not well known in england he also conducted an expedition to observe the solar eclipse of may that provided one of the earliest confirmations of general relativity and he became known for his popular expositions and interpretations of the theory early years eddington was born december in kendal westmorland now cumbria england the son of quaker parents arthur henry eddington headmaster of the quaker school and sarah ann shout his father taught at quaker training college in lancashire before moving to kendal to become headmaster of stramongate school he died in the typhoid epidemic which swept england in his mother was left to bring up her two children with relatively little income the family moved to weston super mare where at first stanley as his mother and sister always called eddington was educated at home before spending three years at preparatory school the family lived at house called varzin walliscote road weston super mare there is commemorative plaque on the building explaining sir arthur contribution to science in eddington entered brynmelyn school he proved to be most capable scholar particularly in mathematics and english literature his performance earned him scholarship to owens college manchester what was later to become the university of manchester in which he was able to attend having turned that year he spent the first year in general course but turned to physics for the next three years eddington was greatly influenced by his physics and mathematics teachers arthur schuster and horace lamb at manchester eddington lived at dalton hall where he came under the lasting influence of the quaker mathematician graham his progress was rapid winning him several scholarships and he graduated with bsc in physics with first class honours in based on his performance at owens college he was awarded scholarship to trinity college cambridge in his tutor at cambridge was robert alfred herman and in eddington became the first ever second year student to be placed as senior wrangler after receiving his in he began research on thermionic emission in the cavendish laboratory this did not go well and meanwhile he spent time teaching mathematics to first year engineering students this hiatus was brief through recommendation by whittaker his senior colleague at trinity college he secured position at the royal observatory in greenwich where he was to embark on his career in astronomy career whose seeds had been sown even as young child when he would often try to count the stars plaque at walliscote road weston super mare astronomy in january eddington was nominated to the post of chief assistant to the astronomer royal at the royal greenwich observatory he left cambridge for greenwich the following month he was put to work on detailed analysis of the parallax of eros on photographic plates that had started in he developed new statistical method based on the apparent drift of two background stars winning him the smith prize in the prize won him fellowship of trinity college cambridge in december george darwin son of charles darwin died suddenly and eddington was promoted to his chair as the plumian professor of astronomy and experimental philosophy in early later that year robert ball holder of the theoretical lowndean chair also died and eddington was named the director of the entire cambridge observatory the next year in may he was elected fellow of the royal society he was awarded the royal medal in and delivered the bakerian lecture in eddington also investigated the interior of stars through theory and developed the first true understanding of stellar processes he began this in with investigations of possible physical explanations for cepheid variable stars he began by extending karl schwarzschild earlier work on radiation pressure in emden polytropic models these models treated star as sphere of gas held up against gravity by internal thermal pressure and one of eddington chief additions was to show that radiation pressure was necessary to prevent collapse of the sphere he developed his model despite knowingly lacking firm foundations for understanding opacity and energy generation in the stellar interior however his results allowed for calculation of temperature density and pressure at all points inside star thermodynamic anisotropy and eddington argued that his theory was so useful for further astrophysical investigation that it should be retained despite not being based on completely accepted physics james jeans contributed the important suggestion that stellar matter would certainly be ionized but that was the end of any collaboration between the pair who became famous for their lively debates eddington defended his method by pointing to the utility of his results particularly his important mass luminosity relation this had the unexpected result of showing that virtually all stars including giants and dwarfs behaved as ideal gases in the process of developing his stellar models he sought to overturn current thinking about the sources of stellar energy jeans and others defended the kelvin helmholtz mechanism which was based on classical mechanics while eddington speculated broadly about the qualitative and quantitative consequences of possible proton electron annihilation and nuclear fusion processes around he anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in stars in his paper the internal constitution of the stars at that time the source of stellar energy
