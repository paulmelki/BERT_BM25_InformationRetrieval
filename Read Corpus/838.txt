friends and schoolmates leer müller kropp and number of other characters there they meet stanislaus katczinsky an older soldier nicknamed kat who becomes paul mentor while fighting at the front bäumer and his comrades have to engage in frequent battles and endure the treacherous and filthy conditions of trench warfare at the beginning of the book remarque writes this book is to be neither an accusation nor confession and least of all an adventure for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it it will try simply to tell of generation of men who even though they may have escaped its shells were destroyed by the war the book does not focus on heroic stories of bravery but rather gives view of the conditions in which the soldiers find themselves the monotony between battles the constant threat of artillery fire and bombardments the struggle to find food the lack of training of young recruits meaning lower chances of survival and the overarching role of random chance in the lives and deaths of the soldiers are described in detail the battles fought here have no names and seem to have little overall significance except for the impending possibility of injury or death for bäumer and his comrades only pitifully small pieces of land are gained about the size of football field which are often lost again later remarque often refers to the living soldiers as old and dead emotionally drained and shaken we are not youth any longer we don want to take the world by storm we are fleeing from ourselves from our life we were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world and we had to shoot it to pieces paul visiting his home highlights the cost of the war on his psyche the town has not changed since he went off to war however he finds that he does not belong here anymore it is foreign world he feels disconnected from most of the townspeople his father asks him stupid and distressing questions about his war experiences not understanding that man cannot talk of such things an old schoolmaster lectures him about strategy and advancing to paris while insisting that paul and his friends know only their own little sector of the war but nothing of the big picture indeed the only person he remains connected to is his dying mother with whom he shares tender yet restrained relationship the night before he is to return from leave he stays up with her exchanging small expressions of love and concern for each other he thinks to himself ah mother mother how can it be that must part from you here sit and there you are lying we have so much to say and we shall never say it in the end he concludes that he ought never to have come home on leave paul feels glad to be reunited with his comrades soon after he volunteers to go on patrol and kills man for the first time in hand to hand combat he watches the man die in pain for hours he feels remorse and asks forgiveness from the man corpse he is devastated and later confesses to kat and albert who try to comfort him and reassure him that it is only part of the war they are then sent on what paul calls good job they must guard supply depot in village that was evacuated due
