asteroids is space themed shooter arcade game designed by lyle rains ed logg and dominic walsh and released in november by atari inc the player controls single spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers the object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers counter fire the game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases asteroids was one of the first major hits of the golden age of arcade games the game sold over arcade cabinets and proved both popular with players and influential with developers in the it was ported to atari home systems and the atari vcs version sold over three million copies the game was widely imitated and it directly influenced defender gravitar and many other video games asteroids was conceived during meeting between logg and rains who decided to use hardware developed by howard delman previously used for lunar lander asteroids was based on an unfinished game titled cosmos its physics model control scheme and gameplay elements were derived from spacewar computer space and space invaders and refined through trial and error the game is rendered on vector display in two dimensional view that wraps around both screen axes gameplay ship is surrounded by asteroids and saucer the objective of asteroids is to destroy asteroids and saucers the player controls triangular ship that can rotate left and right fire shots straight forward and thrust forward once the ship begins moving in direction it will continue in that direction for time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in different direction the ship eventually comes to stop when not thrusting the player can also send the ship into hyperspace causing it to disappear and reappear in random location on the screen at the risk of self destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid each level starts with few large asteroids drifting in various directions on the screen objects wrap around screen edges for instance an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction as the player shoots asteroids they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit smaller asteroids are also worth more points two flying saucers appear periodically on the screen the big saucer shoots randomly and poorly while the small saucer fires frequently at the ship after reaching score of only the small saucer appears as the player score increases the angle range of the shots from the small saucer diminishes until the saucer fires extremely accurately once the screen has been cleared of all asteroids and flying saucers new set of large asteroids appears thus starting the next level the game gets harder as the number of asteroids increases until after the score reaches range between and the player starts with lives upon game start and gains an extra life per points when the player loses all their lives the game ends machine turns over at points which is the maximum high score that can be achieved asteroids contains several bugs the game slows down as the player gains lives due to programming error in that there is no limit for the permitted number of lives the player can lose the game after more than lives are collected lurking exploit in the original game design saucers were supposed to begin shooting as soon as they appeared but this was changed additionally saucers can only aim at the player ship on screen they are not capable of aiming across screen boundary these behaviors allow lurking strategy in which the player stays near the edge of the screen opposite the saucer by keeping just one or two rocks in play player can shoot across the boundary and destroy saucers to accumulate points indefinitely with little risk of being destroyed arcade operators began to complain about losing revenue due to this exploit in response atari issued patched eprom and due to the impact of this exploit atari and other companies changed their development and testing policies to try to prevent future games from having such exploits development asteroids was conceived by lyle rains and programmed by ed logg with collaborations from other atari staff logg was impressed with the atari video computer system later called the atari and he joined atari coin op division to work on dirt bike which was never released due to an unsuccessful field test paul mancuso joined the development team as asteroids technician and engineer howard delman contributed to the hardware during meeting in april rains discussed planet grab multiplayer arcade game later renamed to cosmos logg did not know the name of the game thinking computer space as the inspiration for the two dimensional approach rains conceived of asteroids as mixture of computer space and space invaders combining the two dimensional approach of computer space with space invaders addictive gameplay of completion and eliminate all threats the unfinished game featured giant indestructible asteroid so rains asked logg well why don we have game where you shoot the rocks and blow them up in response logg described similar concept where the player selectively shoots at rocks that break into smaller pieces both agreed on the concept asteroids was implemented on hardware developed by delman and is vector game in which the graphics are composed of lines drawn on vector monitor rains initially wanted the game done in raster graphics but logg experienced in vector graphics suggested an xy monitor because the high image quality would permit precise aiming the hardware is chiefly mos executing the game program and quadrascan high resolution vector graphics processor developed by atari and referred to as an xy display system and the digital vector generator dvg the original design concepts for quadrascan came out of cyan engineering atari off campus research lab in grass valley california in cyan gave it to delman who finished the design
