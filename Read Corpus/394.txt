ahab achaáb was the seventh king of israel the son and successor of king omri and the husband of jezebel of sidon according to the hebrew bible the hebrew bible presents ahab as wicked king particularly for condoning jezebel influence on religious policies and his principal role behind naboth arbitrary execution the existence of ahab is historically supported outside the bible shalmaneser iii of assyria documented in bc that he defeated an alliance of dozen kings in the battle of qarqar one of these was ahab he is also mentioned on the inscriptions of the mesha stele ahab became king of israel in the thirty eighth year of king asa of judah and reigned for twenty two years according to kings william albright dated his reign to bc while edwin thiele offered the dates bc most recently michael coogan has dated ahab reign to bc reign king omri ahab father and founder of the short lived omri dynasty seems to have been successful military leader he is reported in the text of the moabite mesha stele to have oppressed moab for many days during ahab reign moab which had been conquered by his father remained tributary ahab was allied by marriage with jehoshaphat who was king of judah only with aram damascus is he believed to have had strained relations ahab married jezebel the daughter of the king of tyre tells the story of ahab and jezebel and indicates that jezebel was dominant influence on ahab persuading him to abandon yahweh and establish the religion of baal in israel ahab lived in samaria the royal capital established by omri and built temple and altar to baal there these actions were said to have led to severe consequences for israel including drought that lasted for several years and jezebel fanatical religious persecution of the prophets of yahweh which ahab condoned his reputation was so negative that in kings the author attributed to his reign the deaths of abiram and segub the sons of hiel of bethel caused by their father invocation of joshua curse several centuries ago ahab was succeeded by ahaziah and jehoram who reigned over israel until jehu revolt of bc shalmaneser iii bc kurkh monolith names king ahab battle of qarqar the battle of qarqar is mentioned in extra biblical records and was perhaps at apamea where shalmaneser iii of assyria fought great confederation of princes from cilicia northern syria israel ammon and the tribes of the syrian desert bc including ahab the israelite ha ab bu matsir la and hadadezer adad idri ahab contribution was estimated at chariots and men in reality however the number of chariots in ahab forces was probably closer to number in the hundreds based upon archaeological excavations of the area and the foundations of stables that have been found if however the numbers are referring to allies it could possibly include forces from tyre judah edom and moab the assyrian king claimed victory but his immediate return and subsequent expeditions in bc and bc against similar but unspecified coalition seem to show that he met with no lasting success however according to the hebrew bible ahab with troops had previously overthrown ben hadad and his thirty two kings who had come to lay siege to samaria and in the following year obtained decisive victory over him at aphek probably in the sharon plain at antipatris kings treaty was made whereby ben hadad restored the cities which his father had taken from ahab father and trading facilities between damascus and samaria were granted jezreel has been identified as ahab fortified chariot and cavalry base ahab and the prophets in the biblical text ahab has five important encounters with prophets the first encounter is with elijah who predicts drought because of ahab sins kings because of this ahab refers to him as the troubler of israel kings this encounter ends with elijah victory over the prophets of baal in contest held for the sake of ahab and the israelites to bring them into repentance kings the second encounter is between ahab and an unnamed prophet in kings the third is again between ahab and an unnamed prophet who condemns ahab for his actions in battle that had just taken place kings the fourth is when elijah confronts ahab over his role in the unjust execution of naboth and usurpation of the latter ancestral vineyard kings upon the prophet remonstration hast thou killed and also taken possession kings ahab sincerely repented which god relays to elijah kings the fifth encounter is with micaiah the prophet who when asked for advice to recapturing ramoth gilead sarcastically assures ahab that he will be successful micaiah ultimately tells him the truth of god plan to kill ahab in battle due to his reliance on the false prophets who were empowered by deceiving spirit kings death of ahab death of ahab by gustave doré three years later war broke out east of the jordan river and ahab with jehoshaphat of judah went to recover ramoth gilead from the arameans during this battle ahab disguised himself but he was mortally wounded by an unaimed arrow kings the hebrew bible says that dogs licked his blood according to the prophecy of elijah but the septuagint adds that pigs also licked his blood symbolically making him unclean to the israelites who abstained from pork ahab was succeeded by his sons ahaziah and jehoram jezebel death however was more dramatic than ahab as recorded in kings jezebel was confronted by jehu who had her servants throw her out the window causing her death legacy kings through contains the narrative of ahab reign his reign was slightly more emphasised upon than the previous kings due to his blatant trivialization of the sins of jeroboam which the previous kings of israel were plagued by and his subsequent marriage with pagan princess the
