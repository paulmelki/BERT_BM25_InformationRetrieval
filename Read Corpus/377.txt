andré marie ampère january june was french physicist and mathematician who was one of the founders of the science of classical which he referred to as electrodynamics he is also the inventor of numerous applications such as the solenoid term coined by him and the electrical telegraph an autodidact ampère was member of the french academy of sciences and professor at the école polytechnique and the collège de france the si unit of measurement of electric current the ampere is named after him his name is also one of the names inscribed on the eiffel tower early life andré marie ampère was born on january to jean jacques ampère prosperous businessman and jeanne antoinette desutières sarcey ampère during the height of the french enlightenment he spent his childhood and adolescence at the family property at poleymieux au mont or near lyon jean jacques ampère successful merchant was an admirer of the philosophy of jean jacques rousseau whose theories of education as outlined in his treatise émile were the basis of ampère education rousseau believed that young boys should avoid formal schooling and pursue instead an education direct from nature ampère father actualized this ideal by allowing his son to educate himself within the walls of his well stocked library french enlightenment masterpieces such as georges louis leclerc comte de buffon histoire naturelle générale et particulière begun in and denis diderot and jean le rond alembert encyclopédie volumes added between and thus became ampère schoolmasters the young ampère however soon resumed his latin lessons which enabled him to master the works of leonhard euler and daniel bernoulli french revolution in addition ampère used his access to the latest books to begin teaching himself advanced mathematics at age in later life ampère claimed that he knew as much about mathematics and science when he was eighteen as ever he knew but as polymath his reading embraced history travels poetry philosophy and the natural sciences his mother was devout woman so ampère was also initiated into the catholic faith along with enlightenment science the french revolution that began during his youth was also influential ampère father was called into public service by the new revolutionary government becoming justice of the peace in small town near lyon when the jacobin faction seized control of the revolutionary government in his father jean jacques ampère resisted the new political tides and he was guillotined on november as part of the jacobin purges of the period in ampère met julie carron and in they were married andré marie ampère took his first regular job in as mathematics teacher which gave him the financial security to marry carron and father his first child jean jacques named after his father the next year jean jacques ampère eventually achieved his own fame as scholar of languages ampère maturation corresponded with the transition to the napoleonic regime in france and the young father and teacher found new opportunities for success within the technocratic structures favoured by the new french first consul in ampère was appointed professor of physics and chemistry at the école centrale in bourg en bresse leaving his ailing wife and infant son jean jacques antoine ampère in lyon he used his time in bourg to research mathematics producing considérations sur la théorie mathématique de jeu considerations on the mathematical theory of games treatise on mathematical probability that he sent to the paris academy of sciences in teaching career essai sur la philosophie des sciences after the death of his wife in july ampère moved to paris where he began tutoring post at the new école polytechnique in despite his lack of formal qualifications ampère was appointed professor of mathematics at the school in as well as holding positions at this school until in and ampère offered courses in philosophy and astronomy respectively at the university of paris and in he was elected to the prestigious chair in experimental physics at the collège de france in ampère was invited to join the class of mathematicians in the new institut impérial the umbrella under which the reformed state academy of sciences would sit ampère engaged in diverse array of scientific inquiries during the years leading up to his election to the academy writing papers and engaging in topics from mathematics and philosophy to chemistry and astronomy which was customary among the leading scientific intellectuals of the day ampère claimed that at eighteen years he found three culminating points in his life his first communion the reading of antoine leonard thomas eulogy of descartes and the taking of the bastille on the day of his wife death he wrote two verses from the psalms and the prayer lord god of mercy unite me in heaven with those whom you have permitted me to love on earth in times of duress he would take refuge in the reading of the bible and the fathers of the church for time he took into his family the young student frédéric ozanam one of the founders of the conference of charity later known as the society of saint vincent de paul through ampère ozanam had contact with leaders of the neo catholic movement such as françois rené de chateaubriand jean baptiste henri lacordaire and charles forbes rené de montalembert ozanam was beatified by pope john paul ii in work in in september ampère friend and eventual eulogist françois arago showed the members of the french academy of sciences the surprising discovery of danish physicist hans christian ørsted that magnetic needle is deflected by an adjacent electric current ampère began developing mathematical and physical theory to understand the relationship between electricity and magnetism furthering ørsted experimental work ampère showed that two parallel wires carrying electric currents attract or repel each other depending on whether the currents flow in the same or opposite directions respectively this laid the foundation of electrodynamics he also applied mathematics in generalizing physical laws from these experimental results the most important of these was the principle that came to be called ampère
