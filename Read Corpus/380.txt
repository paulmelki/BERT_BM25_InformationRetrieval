albertosaurus meaning alberta lizard is genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaurs that lived in western north america during the late cretaceous period about million years ago the type species sarcophagus was apparently restricted in range to the modern day canadian province of alberta after which the genus is named although an indeterminate species cf albertosaurus sp has been discovered in the corral de enmedio and packard formations in mexico scientists disagree on the content of the genus with some recognizing gorgosaurus libratus as second species as tyrannosaurid albertosaurus was bipedal predator with tiny two fingered hands and massive head that had dozens of large sharp teeth it may have been at the top of the food chain in its local ecosystem while albertosaurus was large for theropod it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative tyrannosaurus rex growing and possibly weighing or less since the first discovery in fossils of more than individuals have been recovered providing scientists with more detailed knowledge of albertosaurus anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids the discovery of individuals at one site provides evidence of pack behaviour and allows studies of ontogeny and population biology which are impossible with lesser known dinosaurs history of discovery naming holotype specimen cmn albertosaurus was named by henry fairfield osborn in one page note at the end of his description of tyrannosaurus rex the name honours alberta the canadian province established the same year in which the first remains were found the generic name also incorporates the greek term σαυρος sauros lizard the most common suffix in dinosaur names the type species is albertosaurus sarcophagus the specific name is derived from ancient greek σαρκοφάγος sarkophagos meaning flesh eating and having the same etymology as the funeral container with which it shares its name combination of the greek words σαρξ flesh and φαγειν to eat more than specimens of all ages are known to science early discoveries the red deer river near drumheller alberta almost three quarters of all albertosaurus remains have been discovered alongside the river in outcrops like the ones on either side of this picture the type specimen is partial skull collected in the summer of from an outcrop of the horseshoe canyon formation alongside the red deer river in alberta this specimen found on june was recovered by an expedition of the geological survey of canada led by the famous geologist joseph burr tyrrell due to lack of specialised equipment the almost complete skull could only be partially secured in tyrrell colleague thomas chesmer weston found an incomplete smaller skull associated with some skeletal material at location nearby the two skulls were assigned to the preexisting species laelaps incrassatus by edward drinker cope in although the name laelaps was preoccupied by genus of mite and had been changed to dryptosaurus in by othniel charles marsh cope refused to recognize the new name created by his archrival marsh however lawrence lambe used the name dryptosaurus incrassatus instead of laelaps incrassatus when he described the remains in detail in and combination first coined by oliver perry hay in shortly later osborn pointed out that incrassatus was based on generic tyrannosaurid teeth so the two horseshoe canyon skulls could not be confidently referred to that species the horseshoe canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of aquilunguis type species of dryptosaurus so osborn created the new name albertosaurus sarcophagus for them in he did not describe the remains in any great detail citing lambe complete description the year before both specimens the holotype cmn and the paratype cmn are stored in the canadian museum of nature in ottawa by the early twenty first century some concerns had arisen that due to the damaged state of the holotype albertosaurus might be nomen dubium dubious name that could only be used for the type specimen itself because other fossils could not reliably be assigned to it however in thomas carr established that the holotype the paratype and comparable later finds all shared single common unique trait or autapomorphy the possession of an enlarged pneumatic opening in the back rim of the side of the palatine bone proving that albertosaurus was valid taxon dry island bonebed teeth from dry island and drumheller royal tyrrell museum on august american paleontologist barnum brown discovered the remains of large group of albertosaurus at another quarry alongside the red deer river because of the large number of bones and the limited time available brown party did not collect every specimen but made sure to collect remains from all of the individuals that they could identify in the bonebed among the bones deposited in the american museum of natural history collections in new york city are seven sets of right metatarsals along with two isolated toe bones that did not match any of the metatarsals in size this indicated the presence of at least nine individuals in the quarry palaeontologist philip currie of the royal tyrrell museum of palaeontology rediscovered the bonebed in and resumed fieldwork at the site which is now located inside dry island buffalo jump provincial park further excavation from to turned up the remains of more individuals of various ages including diminutive two year old and very old individual estimated at over in length none of these individuals are known from complete skeletons and most are represented by remains in both museums excavations continued until when the minimum number of individuals present had been established at on the basis of preserved elements that occur only once in skeleton and at if mirrored elements were counted when differing in size due to ontogeny total of albertosaurus bones had been secured the largest concentration of large theropod fossils known from the cretaceous other discoveries skull tmp in barnum brown during the second year of american museum of natural history operations in alberta uncovered fragmentary partial
