of acupuncture effectiveness in treating pain overall the evidence suggests that short term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long term benefits some research results suggest that acupuncture can alleviate some forms of pain though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture apparent effects are not caused by the treatment itself systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias one meta analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was cost effective as an adjunct to standard care while separate systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain acupuncture is generally safe when done by appropriately trained practitioners using clean needle technique and single use needles when properly delivered it has low rate of mostly minor adverse effects accidents and infections do occur though and are associated with neglect on the part of the practitioner particularly in the application of sterile techniques review conducted in stated that reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the preceding decade the most frequently reported adverse events were pneumothorax and infections since serious adverse events continue to be reported it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk scientific investigation has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional chinese concepts such as qi meridians and acupuncture points and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy qi or meridians which was major part of early belief systems acupuncture is believed

treat by observing and questioning the patient to make diagnosis according to the tradition used in tcm the four diagnostic methods are inspection auscultation and olfaction inquiring and palpation inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue including analysis of the tongue size shape tension color and coating and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge auscultation and olfaction involve listening for particular sounds
