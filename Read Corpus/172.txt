the anglican communion is the third largest christian communion after the catholic church and eastern orthodox church founded in in london england the communion currently has over million members within the church of england and other national and regional churches in full communion the traditional origins of anglican doctrines are summarised in the thirty nine articles the archbishop of canterbury currently justin welby in england acts as focus of unity recognised as primus inter pares first among equals but does not exercise authority in anglican provinces outside of the church of england most but not all member churches of the communion are the historic national or regional anglican churches the anglican communion was founded at the lambeth conference in in london england under the leadership of charles longley archbishop of canterbury the churches of the anglican communion consider themselves to be part of the one holy catholic and apostolic church and to be both catholic and reformed although aligned with the church of england the communion has multitude of beliefs liturgies and practices including evangelical liberal and anglo catholic each retains their own legislative process and episcopal polity under the leadership of local primates for some adherents anglicanism represents non papal catholicism for others form of protestantism though without guiding figure such as luther knox calvin zwingli or wesley or for yet others combination of the two most of its million members live in the anglosphere of former british territories full participation in the sacramental life of each church is available to all communicant members due to their historical link to england ecclesia anglicana means english church some of the member churches are known as anglican such as the anglican church of canada others for example the church of ireland the scottish and american episcopal churches have official names which do not include anglican additionally there are some churches called anglican which are not of the communion ecclesiology polity and ethos the anglican communion has no official legal existence nor any governing structure which might exercise authority over the member churches there is an anglican communion office in london under the aegis of the archbishop of canterbury but it only serves in supporting and organisational role the communion is held together by shared history expressed in its ecclesiology polity and ethos and also by participation in international consultative bodies three elements have been important in holding the communion together first the shared ecclesial structure of the component churches manifested in an episcopal polity maintained through the apostolic succession of bishops and synodical government second the principle of belief expressed in worship investing importance in approved prayer books and their rubrics and third the historical documents and the writings of early anglican divines that have influenced the ethos of the communion originally the church of england was self contained and relied for its unity and identity on its own history its traditional legal and episcopal structure and its status as an established church of the state as such anglicanism was from the outset movement with an explicitly episcopal polity characteristic which has been vital in maintaining the unity of the communion by conveying the episcopate role in manifesting visible catholicity and ecumenism early in its development anglicanism developed vernacular prayer book called the book of common prayer unlike other traditions anglicanism has never been governed by magisterium nor by appeal to one founding theologian nor by an extra credal summary of doctrine such as the westminster confession of the presbyterian churches instead anglicans have typically appealed to the book of common prayer and its offshoots as guide to anglican theology and practise this had the effect of inculcating the principle of lex orandi lex credendi latin loosely translated as the law of praying is the law of believing as the foundation of anglican identity and confession protracted conflict through the th century with radical protestants on the one hand and catholics who recognised the primacy of the pope on the other resulted in an association of churches that were both deliberately vague about doctrinal principles yet bold in developing parameters of acceptable deviation these parameters were most clearly articulated in the various rubrics of the successive prayer books as well as the thirty nine articles of religion these articles have historically shaped and continue to direct the ethos of the communion an ethos reinforced by their interpretation and expansion by such influential early theologians such as richard hooker lancelot andrewes and john cosin with the expansion of the british empire and hence the growth of anglicanism outside great britain and ireland the communion sought to establish new vehicles of unity the first major expression of this were the lambeth conferences of the communion bishops first convened in by charles longley the archbishop of canterbury from the beginning these were not intended to displace the autonomy of the emerging provinces of the communion but to discuss matters of practical interest and pronounce what we deem expedient in resolutions which may serve as safe guides to future action chicago lambeth quadrilateral one of the enduringly influential early resolutions of the conference was the so called chicago lambeth quadrilateral of its intent was to provide the basis for discussions of reunion with the roman catholic and orthodox churches but it had the ancillary effect of establishing parameters of anglican identity it establishes four principles with these words that in the opinion of this conference the following articles supply basis on which approach may be by god blessing made towards home reunion the holy scriptures of the old and new testaments as containing all things necessary to salvation and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith the apostles creed as the baptismal symbol and the nicene creed as the sufficient statement of the christian faith the two sacraments ordained by christ himself baptism and the supper of the lord ministered with unfailing use of christ words of
