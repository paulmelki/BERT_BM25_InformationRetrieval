the aspect ratio of geometric shape is the ratio of its sizes in different dimensions for example the aspect ratio of rectangle is the ratio of its longer side to its shorter sidethe ratio of width to height when the rectangle is oriented as landscape the aspect ratio is most often expressed as two integer numbers separated by colon less commonly as simple or decimal fraction the values and do not represent actual widths and heights but rather the proportion between width and height as an example and are all ways of representing the same aspect ratio in objects of more than two dimensions such as hyperrectangles the aspect ratio can still be defined as the ratio of the longest side to the shortest side applications and uses the term is most commonly used with reference to graphic image image aspect ratio display aspect ratio paper size standard photographic print sizes motion picture film formats standard ad size pixel aspect ratio the aspect ratio of an etched or deposited structure is the ratio of the height of its vertical side wall to its width harmst high aspect ratios allow the construction of tall microstructures without slant tire code tire sizing turbocharger impeller sizing wing aspect ratio of an aircraft or bird astigmatism of an optical lens nanorod dimensions shape factor image analysis and microscopy aspect ratios of simple shapes rectangles for rectangle the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the width to the height of the rectangle square has the smallest possible aspect ratio of examples some not all th century computer monitors vga xga etc standard definition television international paper sizes iso mm still camera film iphone until iphone displays commonly used widescreen computer displays wxga golden ratio close to super mm standard film gauge in many european countries widescreen tv dominoes ultra widescreen super ultra widescreen ellipses for an ellipse the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the major axis to the minor axis an ellipse with an aspect ratio of is circle px aspect ratios of general shapes in geometry there are several alternative definitions to aspect ratios of general compact sets in dimensional space the diameter width aspect ratio dwar of compact set is the ratio of its diameter to its width circle has the minimal dwar which is square has dwar of the cube volume aspect ratio cvar of compact set is the th root of the ratio of the volume of the smallest enclosing axes parallel cube to the set own volume square has the minimal cvar which is circle has cvar of an axis parallel rectangle of width and height where has cvar of if the dimension is fixed then all reasonable definitions of aspect ratio are equivalent to within constant factors notations aspect ratios are mathematically expressed as pronounced to cinematographic aspect ratios are usually denoted as rounded decimal multiple of width vs unit height while photographic and videographic aspect ratios are usually defined and denoted by whole number ratios of width to height in digital images there is subtle distinction between the display aspect ratio the image as displayed and the storage aspect ratio the ratio of pixel dimensions see distinctions see also axial ratio ratio equidimensional ratios in list of film formats squeeze mapping scale ratio vertical orientation references
