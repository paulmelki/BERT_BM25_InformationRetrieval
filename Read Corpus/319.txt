ashoka brƒÅhmi ëÄÖëÄ≤ asoka iast a≈õoka also known as ashoka the great was an indian emperor of the maurya dynasty who ruled almost all of the indian subcontinent from to bce grandson of the dynasty founder chandragupta maurya ashoka promoted the spread of buddhism across ancient asia considered by many to be one of india greatest emperors ashoka expanded chandragupta empire to reign over realm stretching from present day afghanistan in the west to bangladesh in the east it covered the entire indian subcontinent except for parts of present day tamil nadu karnataka and kerala the empire capital was pataliputra in magadha present day patna with provincial capitals at taxila and ujjain ashoka waged destructive war against the state of kalinga modern odisha which he conquered in about bce he converted to buddhism after witnessing the mass deaths of the kalinga war which he had waged out of desire for conquest and which reportedly directly resulted in more than deaths and deportations he is remembered for the ashoka pillars and edicts for sending buddhist monks to sri lanka and central asia and for establishing monuments marking several significant sites in the life of gautama buddha beyond the edicts of ashoka biographical information about him relies on legends written centuries later such as the nd century ce ashokavadana narrative of ashoka part of the divyavadana and in the sri lankan text mahavamsa great chronicle the emblem of the modern republic of india is an adaptation of the lion capital of ashoka his sanskrit name means painless without sorrow the privativum and ≈õoka pain distress in his edicts he is referred to as pali or the beloved of the gods and or priyadarshi pali or he who regards everyone with affection his fondness for tree is the reason for his name being connected to the ashoka tree or polyalthia longifolia and this is referenced in the ashokavadana in the outline of history wells wrote amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like the name of ashoka shines and shines almost alone star sources of information information about ashoka comes from his own inscriptions other inscriptions that mention him or are possibly from his reign and ancient literature especially buddhist texts these sources often contradict each other although various historians have attempted to correlate their testimony plenty is known or not known and so for example while ashoka is often attributed with building many hospitals during his time there is no clear evidence any hospitals existed in ancient india during the rd century bc or that ashoka was responsible for commissioning the construction of any ashoka major rock edict at junagadh contains inscriptions by ashoka fourteen of the edicts of ashoka rudradaman and skandagupta inscriptions ashoka own inscriptions are the earliest self representations of an imperial power in the indian subcontinent however these inscriptions are focused mainly on the topic of dhamma and provide little information regarding other aspects of the maurya state and society even on the topic of dhamma the content of these inscriptions cannot be taken at face value in words of american academic john strong it is sometimes useful to think of ashoka messages as propaganda by politician whose aim is to present favourable image of himself and his administration rather than record historical facts small number of other inscriptions also provide some information about ashoka for example he finds mention in the nd century junagadh rock inscription of rudradaman an inscription discovered at sirkap mentions lost word beginning with priy which is theorised to be ashoka title priyadarshi although this is not certain some other inscriptions such as the sohgaura copper plate inscription have been tentatively dated to ashoka period by section of scholars although this is contested by others buddhist legends much of the information about ashoka comes from buddhist legends which present him as great ideal king these legends appear in texts that are not contemporary to ashoka and were composed by buddhist authors who used various stories to illustrate the impact of their faith on ashoka this makes it necessary to exercise caution while relying on them for historical information among modern scholars opinions range from downright dismissal of these legends as mythological to acceptance of all historical portions that seem plausible the buddhist legends about ashoka exist in several languages including sanskrit pali tibetan chinese burmese sinhala thai lao and khotanese all these legends can be traced to two primary traditions the north indian tradition preserved in the sanskrit language texts such as divyavadana including its constituent ashokavadana and chinese sources such as y√º wang chuan and y√º wang ching the sri lankan tradition preserved in pali lanuage texts such as dipavamsa mahavamsa commentary on mahavamsa buddhaghosha commentary on the vinaya and samanta pasadika there are several major differences between the two traditions for example the sri lankan tradition emphasises ashoka role in convening the third buddhist council and his dispatch of several missionaries to distant regions including his son mahinda to sri lanka however the north indian tradition makes no mention of these events and describes other events not found in the sri lankan tradition such as story about another son named kunala even while narrating the common stories the two traditions diverge in several ways for example both ashokavadana and mahavamsa mention that ashoka queen tishyarakshita had the bodhi tree destroyed in ashokavadana the queen manages to have the tree healed after she realises her mistake in the mahavamsa she permanently destroys the tree but only after branch of the tree has been transplanted in sri lanka in another story both the texts describe ashoka unsuccessful attempts to collect relic of gautama buddha from ramagrama in ashokavadana he fails to do so because he cannot match the devotion of the nagas who hold the relic however in the mahavamsa he fails to do so because the buddha had destined the relic to be
