arminianism is branch of protestantism based on the theological ideas of the dutch reformed theologian jacobus arminius and his historic supporters known as remonstrants his teachings held to the five solae of the reformation but they were distinct from particular teachings of martin luther huldrych zwingli john calvin and other protestant reformers jacobus arminius jakob harmenszoon was student of theodore beza calvin successor at the theological university of geneva arminianism is known to some as soteriological diversification of calvinism to others arminianism is reclamation of early church theological consensus dutch arminianism was originally articulated in the remonstrance theological statement signed by ministers and submitted to the states general of the netherlands the synod of dort was called by the states general to consider the five articles of remonstrance these articles asserted that salvation and condemnation on the day of judgment was conditioned by the graciously enabled faith or unbelief of man the atonement is qualitatively adequate for all men yet that no one actually enjoys experiences this forgiveness of sins except the believer and thus is limited to only those who trust in christ that man has not saving grace of himself nor of the energy of his free will and unaided by the holy spirit no person is able to respond to god will the christian grace of god is the beginning continuance and accomplishment of any good yet man may resist the holy spirit and believers are able to resist sin through grace and christ will keep them from falling but whether they are beyond the possibility of ultimately forsaking god or becoming devoid of grace must be more particularly determined from the scriptures these points note keith stanglin and thomas mccall are consistent with the views of arminius indeed some come verbatim from his declaration of sentiments those who signed this remonstrance and others who supported its theology have since been known as remonstrants many christian denominations have been influenced by arminian views on the will of man being freed by grace prior to regeneration notably the baptists in the th century the methodists in the th century and the seventh day adventist church in the th century some assert that universalists and unitarians in the th and th centuries were theologically linked with arminianism denominations such as the anabaptists beginning in waldensians pre reformation and other groups prior to the reformation have also affirmed that each person may choose the contingent response of either resisting god grace or yielding to it the original beliefs of jacobus arminius himself are commonly defined as arminianism but more broadly the term may embrace the teachings of simon episcopius hugo grotius john wesley and others classical arminianism to which arminius is the main contributor and wesleyan arminianism to which john wesley is the main contributor are the two main schools of thought wesleyan arminianism is often identical with methodism some schools of thought notably semi pelagianism which teaches that the first step of salvation is by human will are confused as being arminian in nature but classical arminianism holds that the first step of salvation is solely the grace of god historically the council of orange condemned semi pelagian thought as well as supralapsarian calvinism and is accepted by some as document which can be understood as teaching doctrine between augustinian thought and semi pelagian thought relegating arminianism to the orthodoxy of the early church fathers the two systems of calvinism and arminianism share both history and many doctrines and the history of christian theology arminianism is related to calvinism historically however because of their differences over the doctrines of divine predestination and election many people view these schools of thought as opposed to each other the distinction is whether god allows his desire to save all to be resisted by an individual will in the arminian doctrine or if god only desires to save some people and that his grace is irresistible to those god chooses to save put another way is god sovereignty shown in part through his allowance of free decisions some calvinists assert that the arminian perspective presents synergistic system of salvation and therefore is not only by grace while arminians firmly reject this conclusion many consider the theological differences to be crucial differences in doctrine while others find them to be relatively minor history portrait of jacobus arminius from kupferstich aus theatrum europaeum by matthaeus merian in jacobus arminius was dutch pastor and theologian in the late th and early th centuries he was taught by theodore beza calvin hand picked successor but after examination of the scriptures he rejected his teacher theology that it is god who unconditionally elects some for salvation instead arminius proposed that the election of god was of believers thereby making it conditional on faith arminius views were challenged by the dutch calvinists especially franciscus gomarus but arminius died before national synod could occur arminius followers not wanting to adopt their leader name called themselves the remonstrants arminius died before he could satisfy holland state general request for page paper outlining his views the remonstrants replied in his stead crafting the five articles of remonstrance in which they express their points of divergence with the stricter calvinism of the belgic confession after some political maneuvering the dutch calvinists were able to convince prince maurice of nassau to deal with the situation maurice systematically removed arminian magistrates from office and called national synod at dordrecht this synod of dort was open primarily to dutch calvinists people while the arminians were excluded people banned from voting with calvinist representatives from other countries people and in published condemnation of arminius and his followers as heretics part of this publication was the famous five points of calvinism in response to the five articles of remonstrance arminians across holland were removed from office imprisoned banished and sworn to silence twelve years later holland officially granted arminianism protection as religion although animosity between arminians and calvinists continued baptists the debate between calvin followers and arminius followers
