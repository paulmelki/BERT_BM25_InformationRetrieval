ambergris ambergris from the north sea ambergris or ambergrease or grey amber is solid waxy flammable substance of dull grey or blackish colour produced in the digestive system of sperm whales freshly produced ambergris has marine fecal odor it acquires sweet earthy scent as it ages commonly likened to the fragrance of rubbing alcohol without the vaporous chemical astringency ambergris has been highly valued by perfumers as fixative that allows the scent to endure much longer although it has been mostly replaced by synthetic ambroxide dogs are attracted to the smell of ambergris and are sometimes used by ambergris searchers etymology the word ambergris comes from the old french ambre gris or grey amber the word amber comes from the same source but it has been applied almost exclusively to fossilized tree resins from the baltic region since the late th century in europe formation ambergris is formed from secretion of the bile duct in the intestines of the sperm whale and can be found floating on the sea or washed up on coastlines it is sometimes found in the abdomens of dead sperm whales because the beaks of giant squids have been discovered within lumps of ambergris scientists have theorized that the substance is produced by the whale tract to ease the passage of hard sharp objects that it may have eaten ambergris is passed like fecal matter it is speculated that an ambergris mass too large to be passed through the intestines is expelled via the mouth but this remains under debate ambergris takes years to form christopher kemp the author of floating gold natural and unnatural history of ambergris says that it is only produced by sperm whales and only by an estimated one percent of them ambergris is rare once expelled by whale it often floats for years before making landfall the very small chance of finding ambergris and the legal ambiguity involved led perfume makers away from ambergris and led chemists on quest to find viable alternatives ambergris is primarily found in the atlantic ocean and on the coasts of south africa brazil madagascar the east indies the maldives china japan india australia new zealand and the molucca islands most commercially collected ambergris comes from the bahamas in the atlantic particularly new providence fossilised ambergris from million years ago has also been found physical properties ambergris is found in lumps of various shapes and sizes usually weighing from to sometimes more when initially expelled by or removed from the whale the fatty precursor of ambergris is pale white in colour sometimes streaked with black soft with strong fecal smell following months to years of and oxidation in the ocean this precursor gradually hardens developing dark grey or black colour crusty and waxy texture and peculiar odour that is at once sweet earthy marine and animalic its scent has been generally described as vastly richer and smoother version of isopropanol without its stinging harshness in this developed condition ambergris has specific gravity ranging from to it melts at about to fatty yellow resinous liquid and at it is volatilised into white vapour it is soluble in ether and in volatile and fixed oils chemical properties ambergris is relatively nonreactive to acid white crystals of terpene known as ambrein can be separated from ambergris by heating raw ambergris in alcohol then allowing the resulting solution to cool breakdown of the relatively scentless ambrein through oxidation produces ambroxan and ambrinol the main odor components of ambergris file ambrein svg ambrein file ambrox svg ambroxan file ambrinol svg ambrinol ambroxan is now produced synthetically and used extensively in the perfume industry applications ambergris has been mostly known for its use in creating perfume and fragrance much like musk perfumes can still be found with ambergris ambergris has historically been used in food and drink serving of eggs and ambergris was reportedly king charles ii of england favorite dish recipe for rum shrub liqueur from the mid th century called for thread of ambergris to be added to rum almonds cloves cassia and the peel of oranges in making cocktail from the english and australian cookery book it has been used as flavoring agent in turkish coffee and in hot chocolate in th century europe the substance is considered an aphrodisiac in some cultures ancient egyptians burned ambergris as incense while in modern egypt ambergris is used for scenting cigarettes the ancient chinese called the substance dragon spittle fragrance during the black death in europe people believed that carrying ball of ambergris could help prevent them from contracting plague this was because the fragrance covered the smell of the air which was believed to be cause of plague during the middle ages europeans used ambergris as medication for headaches colds epilepsy and other ailments legality from the th to the mid th century the whaling industry prospered by some reports nearly whales including sperm whales were killed each year throughout the millions of whales were killed for their oil whalebone and ambergris to fuel profits and they soon became endangered as species as result due to studies showing that the whale populations were being threatened the international whaling commission instituted moratorium on commercial whaling in although ambergris is not harvested from whales many countries also ban the trade of ambergris as part of the more general ban on the hunting and exploitation of whales urine faeces and ambergris that has been naturally excreted by sperm whale are waste products not considered parts or derivatives of cites species and are therefore not covered by the provisions of the convention illegal australia under federal law the export and import of ambergris for commercial purposes is banned by the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act the various states and territories have additional laws regarding ambergris united states the possession and trade of ambergris is prohibited by the endangered species act of legal united kingdom france switzerland maldives in popular culture historical the knowledge of ambergris and how it is produced may have been
