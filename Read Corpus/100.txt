changed over time general descriptions typically include an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from human agency and creation the nature of art and related concepts such as creativity and interpretation are explored in branch of philosophy known as aesthetics overview in the perspective of the history of art artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind from early pre historic art to contemporary art however some theorists feel that the typical concept of artistic works fits less well outside modern western societies one early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older latin meaning which roughly translates to skill or craft as associated with words such as artisan english words derived from this meaning include artifact artificial artifice medical arts and military arts however there are many other colloquial uses of the word all with some relation to its etymology th century bottle twa peoples rwanda artistic works may serve practical functions in addition to their decorative value over time philosophers like plato aristotle socrates and kant among others questioned the meaning of art several dialogues in plato tackle
