an allele modern formation from greek ἄλλος állos other is one of two or more forms of given gene variant the abo blood grouping is controlled by the abo gene which has six common alleles nearly every living human phenotype for the abo gene is some combination of just these six alleles an allele is one of two or more versions of the same gene at the same place on chromosome it can also refer to different sequence variations for several hundred base pair or more region of the genome that codes for protein alleles can come in different extremes of size at the lowest possible size an allele can be single nucleotide polymorphism snp at the higher end it can be up to several thousand base pairs long most alleles result in little or no observable change in the function of the protein the gene codes for however sometimes different alleles can result in different observable phenotypic traits such as different pigmentation notable example of this is gregor mendel discovery that the white and purple flower colors in pea plants were the result of pure line traits that is single gene with two alleles nearly all multicellular organisms have two sets of chromosomes at some point in their life cycle that is they are diploid in this case the chromosomes can be paired each chromosome in the pair contains the same genes in the same order and place along the length of the chromosome for given gene if the two chromosomes contain the same allele they and the organism are homozygous with respect to that gene if the alleles are different they and the organism are heterozygous with respect to that gene etymology the word allele is short form of allelomorph other form word coined by british geneticists william bateson and edith rebecca saunders which was used in the early days of genetics to describe variant forms of gene detected as different phenotypes it derives from the greek prefix ἀλληλο allelo meaning mutual reciprocal or each other which itself is related to the greek adjective ἄλλος allos cognate with latin alius meaning other alleles that lead to dominant or recessive phenotypes in many cases genotypic interactions between the two alleles at locus can be described as dominant or recessive according to which of the two homozygous phenotypes the heterozygote most resembles where the heterozygote is from one of the homozygotes the allele expressed is the one that leads to the dominant phenotype and the other allele is said to be recessive the degree and pattern of dominance varies among loci this type of interaction was first formally described by gregor mendel however many traits defy this simple categorization and the phenotypes are modeled by co dominance and polygenic inheritance the term wild type allele is sometimes used to describe an allele that is thought to contribute to the typical phenotypic character as seen in wild populations of organisms such as fruit flies drosophila melanogaster such wild type allele was historically regarded as leading to dominant overpowering always expressed common and normal phenotype in contrast to mutant alleles that lead to recessive rare and frequently deleterious phenotypes it was formerly thought that most individuals were homozygous for the wild type allele at most gene loci and that any alternative mutant allele was found in homozygous form in small minority of affected individuals often as genetic diseases and more frequently in heterozygous form in carriers for the mutant allele it is now appreciated that most or all gene loci are highly polymorphic with multiple alleles whose frequencies vary from population to population and that great deal of genetic variation is hidden in the form of alleles that do not produce obvious phenotypic differences multiple alleles in the abo blood group system person with type blood displays antigens and may have genotype iaia or iai person with type blood displays antigens and may have the genotype ibib or ibi person with type ab blood displays both and antigens and has the genotype iaib and person with type blood displaying neither antigen has the genotype ii population or species of organisms typically includes multiple alleles at each locus among various individuals allelic variation at locus is measurable as the number of alleles polymorphism present or the proportion of heterozygotes in the population null allele is gene variant that lacks the gene normal function because it either is not expressed or the expressed protein is inactive for example at the gene locus for the abo blood type carbohydrate antigens in humans classical genetics recognizes three alleles ia ib and which determine compatibility of blood transfusions any individual has one of six possible genotypes iaia iai ibib ibi iaib and ii which produce one of four possible phenotypes type produced by iaia homozygous and iai heterozygous genotypes type produced by ibib homozygous and ibi heterozygous genotypes type ab produced by iaib heterozygous genotype and type produced by ii homozygous genotype it is now known that each of the and alleles is actually class of multiple alleles with different dna sequences that produce proteins with identical properties more than alleles are known at the abo locus hence an individual with type blood may be an ao heterozygote an aa homozygote or an aa heterozygote with two different alleles genotype frequencies the frequency of alleles in diploid population can be used to predict the frequencies of the corresponding genotypes see hardy weinberg principle for simple model with two alleles where is the frequency of one allele and is the frequency of the alternative allele which necessarily sum to unity then is the fraction of the population homozygous for the first allele pq is the fraction of heterozygotes and is the fraction homozygous for the alternative allele if the first allele is dominant to the second then the fraction of the population that will show the dominant phenotype is pq and the fraction with the recessive phenotype is with three alleles and in the case of multiple alleles
