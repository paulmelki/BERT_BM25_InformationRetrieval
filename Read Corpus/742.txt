alpha centauri is the closest star system and closest planetary system to earth solar system at light years parsecs from the sun the name is latinized from centauri and abbreviated alpha cen or cen it is triple star system consisting of three stars centauri officially rigil kentaurus centauri officially toliman and centauri officially proxima centauri alpha centauri and are sun like stars class and and together they form the binary star alpha centauri ab to the naked eye the two main components appear to be single star with an apparent magnitude of the brightest star in the southern constellation of centaurus and the third brightest in the night sky outshone only by sirius and canopus alpha centauri has times the mass and times the luminosity of the sun while alpha centauri is smaller and cooler at times the sun mass and times its luminosity the pair orbit around common centre with an orbital period of years their elliptical orbit is eccentric so that the distance between and varies from au astronomical units or about the distance between pluto and the sun to au or about the distance between saturn and the sun alpha centauri or proxima centauri is small and faint red dwarf class though not visible to the naked eye proxima centauri is the closest star to the sun at distance of slightly closer than alpha centauri ab currently the distance between proxima centauri and alpha centauri ab is about equivalent to about times the radius of neptune orbit proxima centauri has two planets proxima an earth sized exoplanet in the habitable zone discovered in and proxima super earth au away which is possibly surrounded by huge ring system discovered in alpha centauri has possible planet bc nomenclature alt image of night sky with stars behind silhouetted treeline with several of the brighter stars joined by lines and labelled centaurus centauri latinised to alpha centauri is the system designation given by johann bayer in it bears the traditional name rigil kentaurus which is latinisation of the arabic name rijl al qinṭūrus meaning the foot of the centaur the name is frequently abbreviated to rigil kent or even rigil though the latter name is better known for beta orionis rigel an alternative name found in european sources toliman is an approximation of the arabic aẓ ẓalīmān in older transcription aṭ ṭhalīmān meaning the two male ostriches an appellation zakariya al qazwini had applied to lambda and mu sagittarii also in the southern hemisphere third name that has been applied is bungula of obscure origin allen can only surmise it may have been coined from the greek letter beta and latin hoof alpha centauri was discovered in by robert innes who suggested that it be named proxima centaurus the name proxima centauri later became more widely used and is now listed by the iau as the approved proper name in the working group on star names of the international astronomical union iau having decided to attribute proper names to individual component stars rather than to multiple systems approved the name rigil kentaurus as being restricted to alpha centauri and the name proxima centauri for alpha centauri on august the iau approved the name toliman for alpha centauri stellar system alpha centauri is triple star system with its two main stars alpha centauri and alpha centauri being binary component the ab designation or older denotes the mass centre of main binary system relative to companion star in multiple star system ab refers to the component of proxima centauri in relation to the central binary being the distance between the centre of mass and the outlying companion because the distance between proxima and either of alpha centauri or is similar the ab binary system is sometimes treated as single gravitational object orbital properties alt graphic image of near circle and narrow ellipse labelled respectively as real trajectory and apparent trajectory with years marked along portions of the ellipses the and components of alpha centauri have an orbital period of years their orbit is moderately eccentric their closest approach or periastron is or about the distance between the sun and saturn and their furthest separation or apastron is about the distance between the sun and pluto the most recent periastron was in august and the next will occur in may the most recent apastron was in may and will next occur in viewed from earth the apparent orbit of and means that their separation and position angle pa are in continuous change throughout their projected orbit observed stellar positions in are separated by arcsec through the pa of increasing to arcsec through in the closest recent approach was in february at arcsec through the pa of the observed maximum separation of these stars is about arcsec while the minimum distance is arcsec the widest separation occurred during february and the next will be in january alpha centauri is about au away from alpha centauri ab this is equivalent to about the distance between alpha centauri ab and the sun until measurements of its small speed and its trajectory were of too little accuracy and duration in years to determine whether it is bound to alpha centauri ab or unrelated radial velocity measurements made in were precise enough to show that proxima centauri and alpha centauri ab are gravitationally bound the orbital period of proxima centauri is approximately years with an eccentricity of much more eccentric than mercury proxima centauri comes within of ab at periastron and its apastron occurs at physical properties the relative sizes and colours of stars in the alpha centauri system compared to the alt four disks of different colours side by side labelled sun centauri centauri and proxima asteroseismic studies chromospheric activity and stellar rotation gyrochronology are all consistent with the alpha centauri system being similar in age to or slightly older than the sun asteroseismic analyses that incorporate tight observational constraints on the stellar parameters for the alpha centauri stars have yielded age estimates of gyr gyr gyr gyr
