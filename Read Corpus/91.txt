actinopterygii new latin actino having rays ancient greek πτέρυξ ptérux wing fins members of which are known as ray finned fishes is clade traditionally class or subclass of the bony fishes the ray finned fishes are so called because their fins are webs of skin supported by bony or horny spines rays as opposed to the fleshy lobed fins that characterize the class sarcopterygii lobe finned fish these actinopterygian fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements the radials which represent the link or connection between these fins and the internal skeleton pelvic and pectoral girdles numerically are the dominant class of vertebrates comprising nearly of the over species of fish they are ubiquitous throughout freshwater and marine environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams extant species can range in size from paedocypris at to the massive ocean sunfish at and the long bodied oarfish at the vast majority of actinopterygii are teleosts characteristics dorsal fin fin rays lateral line kidney swim bladder weberian apparatus inner ear brain nostrils eye gills heart stomach gall bladder spleen internal sex organs ovaries or testes ventral fins spine anal fin tail caudal fin possible other parts not shown barbels adipose fin external genitalia gonopodium ray finned fishes occur in many variant forms the main features of typical ray finned fish are shown in the adjacent diagram the swim bladder is the more derived structure ray finned fishes have many different types of scales but all teleosts the most advanced have leptoid scales the outer part of these scales fan out with bony ridges while the inner part is crossed with fibrous connective tissue leptoid scales are thinner and more transparent than other types of scales and lack the hardened enamel or dentine like layers found in the scales of many other fish unlike ganoid scales which are found in non teleost new scales are added in concentric layers as the fish grows ray finned and lobe finned fishes including tetrapods possessed lungs used for aerial respiration only bichirs retain ventrally budding lungs fin arrangements ray finned fish are very varied in size and shape and in the number of their ray fins and the manner in which they arrange them reproduction three spined stickleback males red belly build nests and compete to attract females to lay eggs in them males then defend and fan the eggs painting by alexander francis lydon in nearly all ray finned fish the sexes are separate and in most species the females spawn eggs that are fertilized externally typically with the male inseminating the eggs after they are laid development then proceeds with free swimming larval stage however other patterns of ontogeny exist with one of the commonest being sequential hermaphroditism in most cases this involves protogyny fish starting life as females and converting to males at some stage triggered by some internal or external factor protandry where fish converts from male to female is much less common than protogyny most families use external rather than internal fertilization of the oviparous teleosts most do not provide parental care viviparity ovoviviparity or some form of parental care for eggs whether by the male the female or both parents is seen in significant fraction of the teleost families no care is likely the ancestral condition viviparity is relatively rare and is found in about of teleost species male care is far more common than female care male territoriality preadapts species for evolving male parental care there are few examples of fish that self fertilise the mangrove rivulus is an amphibious simultaneous hermaphrodite producing both eggs and spawn and having internal fertilisation this mode of reproduction may be related to the fish habit of spending long periods out of water in the mangrove forests it inhabits males are occasionally produced at temperatures below and can fertilise eggs that are then spawned by the female this maintains genetic variability in species that is otherwise highly inbred fossil record right the earliest known fossil actinopterygian is andreolepis hedei dating back million years late silurian remains have been found in russia sweden and estonia classification actinopterygia is divided into the subclasses chondrostei and neopterygii the neopterygii in turn is divided into the infraclasses holostei and teleostei during the mesozoic and cenozoic the teleosts in particular diversified widely and as result of all known fish species are teleosts the cladogram shows the major groups of and their relationship to the terrestrial vertebrates tetrapods that evolved from related group of fish approximate dates are from near et al the polypterids bichirs and reedfish are the sister lineage of all other the sturgeons and paddlefishes are the sister lineage of neopterygii and holostei bowfin and gars are the sister lineage of teleosts the elopomorpha eels and tarpons appear to be the most basal teleosts chondrostei pxatlantic sturgeon chondrostei cartilage bone is subclass of primarily cartilaginous fish showing some ossification earlier definitions of chondrostei are now known to be paraphyletic meaning that this subclass does not contain all the descendants of their common ancestor there were species divided among two orders the sturgeons and paddlefishes and the polypteriformes reedfishes and bichirs reedfish and birchirs are now separated from the chondrostei into their own sister lineage the cladistia it is thought that the chondrosteans evolved from bony fish but lost the bony hardening of their cartilaginous skeletons resulting in lightening of the frame elderly chondrosteans show beginnings of ossification of the skeleton suggesting that this process is delayed rather than lost in these fish this group had once been classified with the sharks the similarities are obvious as not only do the chondrosteans mostly lack bone but the structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than other bony fish and both lack scales excluding the polypteriforms additional shared features include spiracles and in sturgeons heterocercal tail the vertebrae extend into the larger lobe of the caudal fin however the fossil record suggests that these fish have more in common
