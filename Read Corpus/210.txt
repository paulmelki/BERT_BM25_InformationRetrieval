aaron or ahărōn was prophet high priest and the elder brother of moses in the abrahamic religions knowledge of aaron along with his brother moses comes exclusively from religious texts such as the bible and quran the hebrew bible relates that unlike moses who grew up in the egyptian royal court aaron and his elder sister miriam remained with their kinsmen in the eastern border land of egypt goshen when moses first confronted the egyptian king about the israelites aaron served as his brother spokesman prophet to the pharaoh part of the law torah that moses received from god at sinai granted aaron the priesthood for himself and his male descendants and he became the first high priest of the israelites aaron died before the israelites crossed the north jordan river and he was buried on mount hor numbers deuteronomy says he died and was buried at moserah aaron is also mentioned in the new testament of the bible biblical narrative aaron depicted by jacques bergé according to the book of exodus aaron first functioned as moses assistant because moses complained that he could not speak well god appointed aaron as moses prophet exodus at the command of moses he let his rod turn into snake then he stretched out his rod in order to bring on the first three plagues after that moses tended to act and speak for himself during the journey in the wilderness aaron was not always prominent or active at the battle with amalek he was chosen with hur to support the hand of moses that held the rod of god when the revelation was given to moses at biblical mount sinai he headed the elders of israel who accompanied moses on the way to the summit while joshua went with moses to the top however aaron and hur remained below to look after the people from here on in exodus leviticus and numbers joshua appears in the role of moses assistant while aaron functions instead as the first high priest high priest the books of exodus leviticus and numbers maintain that aaron received from god monopoly over the priesthood for himself and his male descendants exodus the family of aaron had the exclusive right and responsibility to make offerings on the altar to yahweh the rest of his tribe the levites were given subordinate within the sanctuary numbers moses anointed and consecrated aaron and his sons to the priesthood and arrayed them in the robes of office leviticus cf exodus he also related to them god detailed instructions for performing their duties while the rest of the israelites listened leviticus aaron and his successors as high priest were given control over the urim and thummim by which the will of god could be determined exodus god commissioned the aaronide priests to distinguish the holy from the common and the clean from the unclean and to teach the divine laws the torah to the israelites leviticus the priests were also commissioned to bless the people numbers when aaron completed the altar offerings for the first time and with moses blessed the people and the glory of the appeared unto all the people and there came fire out from before the and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people saw they shouted and fell on their faces leviticus in this way the institution of the aaronide priesthood was established in later books of the hebrew bible aaron and his kin are not mentioned very often except in literature dating to the babylonian captivity and later the books of judges samuel and kings mention priests and levites but do not mention the aaronides in particular the book of ezekiel which devotes much attention to priestly matters calls the priestly upper class the zadokites after one of king david priests it does reflect two tier priesthood with the levites in subordinate position two tier hierarchy of aaronides and levites appears in ezra nehemiah and chronicles as result many historians think that aaronide families did not control the priesthood in pre exilic israel what is clear is that high priests claiming aaronide descent dominated the second temple period most scholars think the torah reached its final form early in this period which may account for aaron prominence in exodus leviticus and numbers conflicts aaron plays leading role in several stories of conflicts during israel wilderness wanderings during the prolonged absence of moses on mount sinai the people provoked aaron to make golden calf exodus this incident nearly caused god to destroy the israelites exodus moses successfully intervened but then led the loyal levites in executing many of the culprits plague afflicted those who were left exodus aaron however escaped punishment for his role in the affair because of the intercession of moses according to deuteronomy later retellings of this story almost always excuse aaron for his role for example in rabbinic sources and in the quran aaron was not the idol maker and upon moses return begged his pardon because he felt mortally threatened by the israelites quran on the day of aaron consecration his oldest sons nadab and abihu were burned up by divine fire because they offered strange incense leviticus most interpreters think this story reflects conflict between priestly families some time in israel past others argue that the story simply shows what can happen if the priests do not follow god instructions given through moses the torah generally depicts the siblings moses aaron and miriam as the leaders of israel after the exodus view also reflected in the biblical book of micah numbers however reports that on one occasion aaron and miriam complained about moses exclusive claim to be the prophet their presumption was rebuffed by god who affirmed moses uniqueness as the one with whom the spoke face to face miriam was punished with skin disease tzaraath that turned her skin white aaron pleaded with moses to intercede for her and miriam after seven days quarantine was
