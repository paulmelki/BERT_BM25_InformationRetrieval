alfred habdank skarbek korzybski july march was polish american independent scholar who developed field called general semantics which he viewed as both distinct from and more encompassing than the field of semantics he argued that human knowledge of the world is limited both by the human nervous system and the languages humans have developed and thus no one can have direct access to reality given that the most we can know is that which is filtered through the brain responses to reality his best known dictum is the map is not the territory early life and career alfred korzybski family coat of arms see abdank coat of arms born in warsaw poland then part of the russian empire korzybski belonged to an aristocratic polish family whose members had worked as mathematicians scientists and engineers for generations he learned the polish language at home and the russian language in schools and having french and german governess he became fluent in four languages as child korzybski studied engineering at the warsaw university of technology during the first world war korzybski served as an intelligence officer in the russian army after being wounded in leg and suffering other injuries he moved to north america in first to canada then to the united states to coordinate the shipment of artillery to russia he also lectured to polish american audiences about the conflict promoting the sale of war bonds after the war he decided to remain in the united states becoming naturalized citizen in he met mira edgerly painter of portraits on ivory shortly after the armistice they married in january the marriage lasted until his death dutton published korzybski first book manhood of humanity in in this work he proposed and explained in detail new theory of humankind mankind as time binding class of life humans perform time binding by the transmission of knowledge and abstractions through time which become accreted in cultures general semantics korzybski work culminated in the initiation of discipline that he named general semantics gs this should not be confused with semantics the basic principles of general semantics which include time binding are described in the publication science and sanity published in in korzybski founded the institute of general semantics in chicago the post world war ii housing shortage in chicago cost him the institute building lease so in he moved the institute to lakeville connecticut where he directed it until his death in korzybski maintained that humans are limited in what they know by the structure of their nervous systems and the structure of their languages humans cannot experience the world directly but only through their abstractions nonverbal impressions or gleanings derived from the nervous system and verbal indicators expressed and derived from language these sometimes mislead us about what is the truth our understanding sometimes lacks similarity of structure with what is actually happening he sought to train our awareness of abstracting using techniques he had derived from his study of mathematics and science he called this awareness this goal of his system consciousness of abstracting his system included the promotion of attitudes such as don know let see in order that we may better discover or reflect on its realities as revealed by modern science another technique involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet an experience he termed silence on the objective levels to be many devotees and critics of korzybski reduced his rather complex system to simple matter of what he said about the verb form is of the general verb to be his system however is based primarily on such terminology as the different orders of abstraction and formulations such as consciousness of abstracting the contention that korzybski opposed the use of the verb to be would be profound exaggeration he thought that certain uses of the verb to be called the is of identity and the is of predication were faulty in structure statement such as elizabeth is fool said of person named elizabeth who has done something that we regard as foolish in korzybski system one assessment of elizabeth belongs to higher order of abstraction than elizabeth herself korzybski remedy was to deny identity in this example to be aware continually that elizabeth is not what we call her we find elizabeth not in the verbal domain the world of words but the nonverbal domain the two he said amount to different orders of abstraction this was expressed by korzybski most famous premise the map is not the territory note that this premise uses the phrase is not form of to be this and many other examples show that he did not intend to abandon to be as such in fact he said explicitly that there were no structural problems with the verb to be when used as an auxiliary verb or when used to state existence or location it was even acceptable at times to use the faulty forms of the verb to be as long as one was aware of their structural limitations anecdotes one day korzybski was giving lecture to group of students and he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve packet of biscuits wrapped in white paper from his briefcase he muttered that he just had to eat something and he asked the students on the seats in the front row if they would also like biscuit few students took biscuit nice biscuit don you think said korzybski while he took second one the students were chewing vigorously then he tore the white paper from the biscuits in order to reveal the original packaging on it was big picture of dog head and the words dog cookies the students looked at the package and were shocked two of them wanted to vomit put their hands in front of their mouths and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet you see korzybski remarked have just demonstrated that people don just eat food but also words and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the
