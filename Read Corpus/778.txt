this color spectrum image alpha channel falls off to zero at its base where it is blended with the background color in computer graphics alpha compositing is the process of combining one image with background to create the appearance of partial or full transparency it is often useful to render picture elements pixels in separate passes or layers and then combine the resulting images into single final image called the composite compositing is used extensively in film when combining computer rendered image elements with live footage alpha blending is also used in computer graphics to put rasterized foreground elements over background in order to combine the picture elements of the images correctly it is necessary to keep an associated matte for each element in addition to its color this matte layer contains the coverage information the shape of the geometry being drawn making it possible to distinguish between parts of the image where something was drawn and parts that are empty although the most basic operation of combining two images is to put one over the other there are many operations or blend modes that are used description to store matte information the concept of an alpha channel was introduced by alvy ray smith in the late and fully developed in paper by thomas porter and tom duff in image color combination is stored for each picture element pixel additional data for each pixel is stored in the alpha channel with value ranging from to value of means that the pixel is transparent and does not provide any coverage information there is no occlusion at the image pixel window because the geometry did not overlap this pixel value of means that the pixel is fully occluding because the geometry completely overlaps the pixel window straight versus premultiplied if an alpha channel is used in an image there are two common representations that are available straight unassociated alpha and premultiplied associated alpha with straight alpha the rgb components represent the color of the object or pixel disregarding its opacity with premultiplied alpha the rgb components represent the emission of the object or pixel and the alpha represents the occlusion more obvious advantage of this is that in certain situations it can save subsequent multiplication if the image is used many times during later compositing however the most significant advantages of using premultiplied alpha are for correctness and simplicity rather than performance premultiplied alpha allows correct filtering and blending in addition premultiplied alpha allows regions of regular alpha blending and regions with additive blending mode to be encoded within the same image because channel values are usually stored in fixed point format which bounds the values to be between and assuming that the pixel color is expressed using straight non premultiplied rgba tuples pixel value of implies pixel that has of the maximum green intensity and opacity if the color were fully green its rgba would be however if this pixel uses premultiplied alpha all of the rgb values are multiplied or scaled for occlusion by the alpha value which is appended to yield in this case the value for the channel actually indicates green emission intensity with occlusion pure green emission would be encoded as knowing whether file uses straight or premultiplied alpha is essential to correctly process or composite it as different calculation is required it is also entirely acceptable to have an rgba triplet express emission with no occlusion such as fires and flames glows flares and other such phenomena can only be represented using associated premultiplied alpha the only important difference is in the dynamic range of the colour representation in finite precision numerical calculations which is in all applications premultiplied alpha has unique representation for transparent pixels avoiding the need to choose clear color or resultant artifacts such as edge fringes see the next paragraphs in an associated premultiplied alpha image the rgb represents the emission amount while the alpha is occlusion premultiplied alpha has some practical advantages over normal alpha blending because interpolation and filtering give correct results ordinary interpolation without premultiplied alpha leads to rgb information leaking out of fully transparent regions even though this rgb information is ideally invisible when interpolating or filtering images with abrupt borders between transparent and opaque regions this can result in borders of colors that were not visible in the original image errors also occur in areas of because the rgb components are not correctly weighted giving incorrectly high weighting to the color of the more transparent lower alpha pixels can reduce the available relative precision in the rgb values when using integer or fixed point representation for the color components which may cause noticeable loss of quality if the color information is later brightened or if the alpha channel is removed in practice this is not usually noticeable because during typical composition operations such as over the influence of the low precision colour information in low alpha areas on the final output image after composition is correspondingly reduced this loss of precision also makes premultiplied images easier to compress using certain compression schemes as they do not record the color variations hidden inside transparent regions and can allocate fewer bits to encode low alpha areas the same limitations of lower quantisation bit depths such as bit per channel are also present in imagery without alpha and this argument is problematic as result with the existence of an alpha channel it is possible to express compositing image operations using compositing algebra for example given two image elements and the most common compositing operation is to combine the images such that appears in the foreground and appears in the background this can be expressed as over in addition to over porter and duff defined the compositing operators in held out by the phrase refers to holdout matting and is usually abbreviated out atop and xor and the reverse operators rover rin rout and ratop from consideration of choices in blending the colors of two pixels when their coverage is conceptually
