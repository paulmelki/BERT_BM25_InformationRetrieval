sir andrew john wiles born april is an english mathematician and royal society research professor at the university of oxford specializing in number theory he is best known for proving fermat last theorem for which he was awarded the abel prize and the copley medal by the royal society he was appointed knight commander of the order of the british empire in and in was appointed as the first regius professor of mathematics at oxford wiles is also macarthur fellow education and early life wiles was born on april in cambridge england the son of maurice frank wiles later the regius professor of divinity at the university of oxford and patricia wiles née mowll his father worked as the chaplain at ridley hall cambridge for the years wiles attended king college school cambridge and the leys school cambridge wiles states that he came across fermat last theorem on his way home from school when he was years old he stopped at his local library where he found book about the theorem fascinated by the existence of theorem that was so easy to state that he ten year old could understand it but that no one had proven he decided to be the first person to prove it however he soon realised that his knowledge was too limited so he abandoned his childhood dream until it was brought back to his attention at the age of by ken ribet proof of the epsilon conjecture which gerhard frey had previously linked to fermat famous equation career and research wiles earned his bachelor degree in mathematics in at merton college oxford and phd in as graduate student of clare college cambridge after stay at the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey in wiles became professor of mathematics at princeton university in wiles was guggenheim fellow at the institut des hautes études scientifiques near paris and at the école normale supérieure from to wiles was royal society research professor at the university of oxford and then he returned to princeton from to wiles was eugene higgins professor at princeton he rejoined oxford in as royal society research professor in may he was appointed regius professor of mathematics at oxford the first in the university history wiles graduate research was guided by john coates beginning in the summer of together these colleagues worked on the arithmetic of elliptic curves with complex multiplication by the methods of iwasawa theory he further worked with barry mazur on the main conjecture of iwasawa theory over the rational numbers and soon afterward he generalized this result to totally real fields proof of fermat last theorem starting in mid based on successive progress of the previous few years of gerhard frey jean pierre serre and ken ribet it became clear that fermat last theorem could be proven as corollary of limited form of the modularity theorem unproven at the time and then known as the taniyama shimura weil conjecture the modularity theorem involved elliptic curves which was also wiles own specialist area the conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as important but extraordinarily difficult or perhaps impossible to prove for example wiles ex supervisor john coates states that it seemed impossible to actually prove and ken ribet considered himself one of the vast majority of people who believed it was completely inaccessible adding that andrew wiles was probably one of the few people on earth who had the audacity to dream that you can actually go and prove it despite this wiles with his from childhood fascination with fermat last theorem decided to undertake the challenge of proving the conjecture at least to the extent needed for frey curve he dedicated all of his research time to this problem for over six years in near total secrecy covering up his efforts by releasing prior work in small segments as separate papers and confiding only in his wife in june he presented his proof to the public for the first time at conference in cambridge in august it was discovered that the proof contained flaw in one area wiles tried and failed for over year to repair his proof according to wiles the crucial idea for circumventing rather than closing this area came to him on september when he was on the verge of giving up together with his former student richard taylor he published second paper which circumvented the problem and thus completed the proof both papers were published in may in dedicated issue of the annals of mathematics awards and honours andrew wiles in front of the statue of pierre de fermat in beaumont de lomagne fermat birthplace in southern france wiles proof of fermat last theorem has stood up to the scrutiny of the world other mathematical experts wiles was interviewed for an episode of the bbc documentary series horizon that focused on fermat last theorem this was renamed the proof and was made an episode of the pbs science television series nova his work and life are also described in great detail in simon singh popular book fermat last theorem wiles has been awarded number of major prizes in mathematics and science junior whitehead prize of the london mathematical society elected fellow of the royal society frs in schock prize fermat prize wolf prize in mathematics elected foreign associate of the national academy of sciences nas award in mathematics from the national academy of sciences royal medal ostrowski prize cole
