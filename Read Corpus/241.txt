the almond prunus dulcis syn prunus amygdalus is species of tree native to iran and surrounding countries but widely cultivated elsewhere the almond is also the name of the edible and widely cultivated seed of this tree within the genus prunus it is classified with the peach in the subgenus amygdalus distinguished from the other subgenera by corrugations on the shell endocarp surrounding the seed the fruit of the almond is drupe consisting of an outer hull and hard shell with the seed which is not true nut inside shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed almonds are sold shelled or unshelled blanched almonds are shelled almonds that have been treated with hot water to soften the seedcoat which is then removed to reveal the white embryo description tree the almond is deciduous tree growing in height with trunk of up to in diameter the young twigs are green at first becoming purplish where exposed to sunlight then grey in their second year the leaves are long with serrated margin and petiole the flowers are white to pale pink diameter with five petals produced singly or in pairs and appearing before the leaves in early spring almond grows best in mediterranean climates with warm dry summers and mild wet winters the optimal temperature for their growth is between and the tree buds have chilling requirement of to hours below to break dormancy almonds begin bearing an economic crop in the third year after planting trees reach full bearing five to six years after planting the fruit matures in the autumn months after flowering drupe almonds arranged on plate the almond fruit is long in botanical terms it is not nut but drupe the outer covering or exocarp fleshy in other members of prunus such as the plum and cherry is instead thick leathery grey green coat with downy exterior called the hull inside the hull is reticulated hard woody shell like the outside of peach pit called the endocarp inside the shell is the edible seed commonly called nut generally one seed is present but occasionally two occur after the fruit matures the hull splits and separates from the shell and an abscission layer forms between the stem and the fruit so that the fruit can fall from the tree file green almonds jpg green almonds file mandel gr jpg almond in shell and shelled file blanched almonds jpg blanched almonds file almond shelled jpg

surrounding countries it was spread by humans in ancient times along the shores of the mediterranean into northern africa and southern europe and more recently transported to other parts of the world notably california united states the wild form of domesticated almond grows in parts of the levant selection of the sweet type from the many bitter types in the wild marked the beginning of almond domestication it is unclear as to which wild ancestor of the almond created the domesticated species the species prunus fenzliana may be the most likely wild ancestor of the almond in part because it is native to armenia and western azerbaijan where it was apparently domesticated wild almond species were grown by early farmers at first unintentionally in the garbage heaps and later intentionally in their orchards almonds were one of the earliest domesticated fruit trees due to the ability of the grower to raise attractive almonds from seed thus in spite of the fact that this plant does not lend itself to propagation from suckers or from cuttings it could have been domesticated even before the introduction of grafting domesticated almonds appear in the early bronze age bc such as the archaeological sites of numeira jordan or possibly earlier another well known archaeological example of the almond is the fruit found in tutankhamun tomb in egypt bc probably imported from the levant of the european countries that the royal botanic garden edinburgh reported as cultivating almonds germany is the northernmost though the domesticated form can be found as far north as iceland etymology and names the word almond comes from old french almande or alemande late latin amandula derived from amygdala from the ancient greek ἀμυγδάλη amygdálē cf amygdala an almond shaped portion of the brain the al in english for the used in other languages may be due confusion with the arabic article al the word having first dropped the as in the italian form mandorla the british pronunciation ah mond and the modern catalan ametlla and modern french amande show form of the word closer to the original other related names of almond include mandel or knackmandel german mandorlo italian for the tree mandorla italian for the fruit amêndoa portuguese and almendro spanish for the tree almendra spanish for the fruit interestingly however in hebrew the word for almond pronounced shak ed is also the word for tonsil the adjective amygdaloid literally like an almond is used to describe objects which are roughly almond shaped particularly shape which is part way between triangle and an ellipse see for example the brain structure amygdala which uses direct borrowing of the greek term amygdalē cultivation pollination the pollination of california almonds is the largest annual managed pollination event in the world with million hives nearly half of all beehives in the us being trucked in february to the almond groves much of the pollination is managed by pollination brokers who contract with migratory beekeepers from at least states for the event this business has been heavily affected by colony collapse disorder causing nationwide shortages of honey bees and increasing the price of insect pollination to partially protect almond growers from the rising cost of insect pollination researchers at the agricultural research service ars have developed new line of self pollinating almond trees self pollinating almond trees such as the tuono have been
