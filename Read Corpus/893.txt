ascorbic acid is an organic compound with formula originally called hexuronic acid it is white solid but impure samples can appear yellowish it dissolves well in water to give mildly acidic solutions it is mild reducing agent ascorbic acid exists as two enantiomers mirror image isomers commonly denoted for levo and for dextro the isomer is the one most often encountered it occurs naturally in many foods and is one form vitamer of vitamin an essential nutrient for humans and many animals deficiency of vitamin causes scurvy formerly major disease of sailors in long sea voyages it is used as food additive and dietary supplement for its antioxidant properties the form can be made via chemical synthesis but has no significant biological role history the antiscorbutic properties of certain foods were demonstrated in the th century by james lind in axel holst and theodor frølich discovered that the antiscorbutic factor was water soluble chemical substance distinct from the one that prevented beriberi between and albert szent györgyi isolated candidate for this substance which he called it hexuronic acid first from plants and later from animal adrenal glands in charles glen king confirmed that it was indeed the antiscorbutic factor in sugar chemist walter norman haworth working with samples of hexuronic acid that szent györgyi had isolated from paprika and sent him in the previous year deduced the correct structure and optical isomeric nature of the compound and in reported its first synthesis in reference to the compound antiscorbutic properties haworth and szent györgyi proposed to rename it scorbic acid for the compound and later specifically ascorbic acid because of their work in the nobel prizes for chemistry and medicine were awarded to haworth and szent györgyi respectively chemical properties acidity ascorbic acid is vinylogous acid and forms the ascorbate anion when deprotonated on one of the hydroxyls this property is characteristic of reductones enediols with carbonyl group adjacent to the enediol group namely with the group oh oh the ascorbate anion is stabilized by electron delocalization that results from resonance between two forms px for this reason ascorbic acid is much more acidic than would be expected if the compound contained only isolated hydroxyl groups salts the ascorbate anion forms salts such as sodium ascorbate calcium ascorbate and potassium ascorbate esters ascorbic acid can also react with organic acids as an alcohol forming esters such as ascorbyl palmitate and ascorbyl stearate nucleophilic attack nucleophilic attack of ascorbic acid on proton results in diketone image ascorbic diketone png oxidation acid radical dehydroascorbic acid the ascorbate ion is the predominant species at typical biological ph values it is mild reducing agent and antioxidant it is oxidized with loss of one electron to form radical cation and then with loss of second electron to form dehydroascorbic acid it typically reacts with oxidants of the reactive oxygen species such as the hydroxyl radical ascorbic acid is special because it can transfer single electron owing to the resonance stabilized nature of its own radical ion called the net reaction is ro ro roh on exposure to oxygen ascorbic acid will undergo further oxidative decomposition to various products including diketogulonic acid xylonic acid threonic acid and oxalic acid reactive oxygen species are damaging to animals and plants at the molecular level due to their possible interaction with nucleic acids proteins and lipids sometimes these radicals initiate chain reactions ascorbate can terminate these chain radical reactions by electron transfer the oxidized forms of ascorbate are relatively unreactive and do not cause cellular damage however being good electron donor excess ascorbate in the presence of free metal ions can not only promote but also initiate free radical reactions thus making it potentially dangerous pro oxidative compound in certain metabolic contexts ascorbic acid and its sodium potassium and calcium salts are commonly used as antioxidant food additives these compounds are water soluble and thus cannot protect fats from oxidation for this purpose the fat soluble esters of ascorbic acid with long chain fatty acids ascorbyl palmitate or ascorbyl stearate can be used as food antioxidants other reactions it creates volatile compounds when mixed with glucose and amino acids in it is cofactor in tyrosine oxidation uses food additive the main use of ascorbic acid and its salts is as food additives mostly to combat oxidation it is approved for this purpose in the eu with number usa australia and new zealand dietary supplement another major use of ascorbic acid is as dietary supplement niche non food uses ascorbic acid is easily oxidized and so is used as reductant in photographic developer solutions among others and as preservative in fluorescence microscopy and related fluorescence based techniques ascorbic acid can be used as an antioxidant to increase fluorescent signal and chemically retard dye photobleaching it is also commonly used to remove dissolved metal stains such as iron from fiberglass swimming pool surfaces in plastic manufacturing ascorbic acid can be used to assemble molecular chains more quickly and with less waste than traditional synthesis methods heroin users are known to use ascorbic acid as means to convert heroin base to water soluble salt so that it can be injected as justified by its reaction with iodine it is used to negate the effects of iodine tablets in water purification it reacts with the sterilized water removing the taste color and smell of the iodine this is why it is often sold as second set of tablets in most sporting goods stores as potable aqua neutralizing tablets along with the potassium iodide tablets intravenous high dose ascorbate is being used as and biological response modifying agent currently it is still under clinical trials synthesis natural biosynthesis of vitamin occurs in many plants and animals by variety of processes industrial preparation the outdated but historically important industrial synthesis of ascorbic acid from glucose via the reichstein process eighty percent of the world supply of ascorbic acid is produced in china ascorbic acid is prepared in industry from glucose in method based on the historical
