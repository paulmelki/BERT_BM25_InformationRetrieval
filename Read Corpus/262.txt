the ashes is test cricket series played between england and australia the ashes are regarded as being held by the team that most recently won the series if the series is drawn the team that currently holds the ashes retains the trophy the term originated in satirical obituary published in british newspaper the sporting times immediately after australia victory at the oval its first test win on english soil the obituary stated that english cricket had died and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to australia the mythical ashes immediately became associated with the series played in australia before which the english captain ivo bligh had vowed to regain those ashes the english media therefore dubbed the tour the quest to regain the ashes after england had won two of the three tests on the tour small urn was presented to bligh by group of melbourne women including florence morphy whom bligh married within year the contents of the urn are reputed to be the ashes of wooden bail and were humorously described as the ashes of australian cricket it is not clear whether that tiny silver urn is the same as the small terracotta urn given to the mcc by bligh widow after his death in the urn has never been the official trophy of the ashes series having been personal gift to bligh however replicas of the urn are often held aloft by victorious teams as symbol of their victory in an ashes series since the ashes series waterford crystal representation of the ashes urn called the ashes trophy has been presented to the winners of an ashes series as the official trophy of that series irrespective of which side holds the tournament the urn remains in the mcc museum at lord it has however been taken to australia to be put on touring display on two occasions as part of the australian bicentenary celebrations in and to accompany the ashes series in an ashes series traditionally consists of five tests hosted in turn by england and australia at least once every two years there have been ashes series australia have won england and six series have been drawn origins fred spofforth the demon bowler was instrumental in australia victory over england with wickets for the first test match between england and australia was played in melbourne australia in though the ashes legend started later after the ninth test played in on their tour of england that year the australians played just one test at the oval in london it was low scoring affair on difficult wicket australia made mere runs in its first innings and england led by hornby took run lead with total of in its second innings australia boosted by spectacular runs off deliveries from hugh massie managed which left england only runs to win the australians were greatly demoralised by the manner of their second innings collapse but fast bowler fred spofforth spurred on by the gamesmanship of his opponents in particular grace refused to give in this thing can be done he declared spofforth went on to devastate the english batting taking his final four wickets for only two runs to leave england just eight runs short of victory when ted peate england last batsman came to the crease his side needed just ten runs to win but peate managed only two before he was bowled by harry boyle an astonished oval crowd fell silent struggling to believe that england could possibly have lost to colony on home soil when it finally sank in the crowd swarmed onto the field cheering loudly and chairing boyle and spofforth to the pavilion when peate returned to the pavilion he was reprimanded by his captain for not allowing his partner charles studd one of the best batsman in england having already hit two centuries that season against the colonists to get the runs peate humorously replied had no confidence in mr studd sir so thought had better do my best the momentous defeat was widely recorded in the british press which praised the australians for their plentiful pluck and berated the englishmen for their lack thereof celebrated poem appeared in punch on saturday september the first verse quoted most frequently reads well done cornstalks whipt us fair and square was it luck that tript us was it

australia he would as england captain recover those ashes he spoke of them several times over the course of the tour and the australian media quickly caught on the three match series resulted in two one win to england notwithstanding fourth match won by the australians whose status remains matter of ardent dispute in the years following bligh campaign the term the ashes largely disappeared from public use there is no indication that this was the accepted name for the series at least not in england the term became popular again in australia first when george giffen in his memoirs with bat and ball used the term as if it were well known the true and global revitalisation of interest in the concept dates from when pelham warner took team to australia with the promise that he would regain the ashes as had been the case on bligh tour years before the australian media latched fervently onto the term and this time it stuck having fulfilled his promise warner published book entitled how we recovered the ashes although the origins of the term are not referred to in the text the title served along with the general hype created in australia to revive public interest in the legend the first
