the advanced encryption standard aes also known by its original name rijndael is specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the national institute of standards and technology nist in aes is subset of the rijndael block cipher developed by two belgian cryptographers vincent rijmen and joan daemen who submitted proposal to nist during the aes selection process rijndael is family of ciphers with different key and block sizes for aes nist selected three members of the rijndael family each with block size of bits but three different key lengths and bits aes has been adopted by the government and is now used worldwide it supersedes the data encryption standard des which was published in the algorithm described by aes is symmetric key algorithm meaning the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data in the united states aes was announced by the nist as fips pub fips on november this announcement followed five year standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were presented and evaluated before the rijndael cipher was selected as the most suitable see advanced encryption standard process for more details aes is included in the iso iec standard aes became effective as federal government standard on may after approval by the secretary of commerce aes is available in many different encryption packages and is the first and only publicly accessible cipher approved by the national security agency nsa for top secret information when used in an nsa approved cryptographic module see security of aes below definitive standards the advanced encryption standard aes is defined in each of fips pub advanced encryption standard aes iso iec block ciphers description of the ciphers aes is based on design principle known as substitution permutation network and is efficient in both software and hardware unlike its predecessor des aes does not use feistel network aes is variant of rijndael with fixed block size of bits and key size of or bits by contrast rijndael per se is specified with block and key sizes that may be any multiple of bits with minimum of and maximum of bits aes operates on column major order array of bytes termed the state most aes calculations are done in particular finite field for instance bytes are represented as this two dimensional array the key size used for an aes cipher specifies the number of transformation rounds that convert the input called the plaintext into the final output called the ciphertext the number of rounds are as follows rounds for bit keys rounds for bit keys rounds for bit keys each round consists of several processing steps including one that depends on the encryption key itself set of reverse rounds are applied to transform ciphertext back into the original plaintext using the same encryption key high level description of the algorithm round keys are derived from the cipher key using the aes key schedule aes requires separate bit round key block for each round plus one more initial round key addition each byte of the state is combined with byte of the round key using bitwise xor or rounds non linear substitution step where each byte is replaced with another according to lookup table transposition step where the last three rows of the state are shifted cyclically certain number of steps linear mixing operation which operates on the columns of the state combining the four bytes in each column final round making or rounds in total the step in the step each byte in the state is replaced with its entry in fixed bit lookup table bij aij in the step each byte in the state array is replaced with using an bit substitution box this operation provides the non linearity in the cipher the box used is derived from the multiplicative inverse over known to have good non linearity properties to avoid attacks based on simple algebraic properties the box is constructed by combining the inverse function with an invertible affine transformation the box is also chosen to avoid any fixed points and so is derangement and also any opposite fixed points while performing the decryption the step the inverse of is used which requires first taking the inverse of the affine transformation and then finding the multiplicative inverse the step in the step bytes in each row of the state are shifted cyclically to the left the number of places each byte is shifted differs incrementally for each row the step operates on the rows of the state it cyclically shifts the bytes in each row by certain offset for aes the first row is left unchanged each byte of the second row is shifted one to the left similarly the third and fourth rows are shifted by offsets of two and three respectively in this way each column of the output state of the step is composed of bytes from each column of the input state the importance of this step is to avoid the columns being encrypted independently in which case aes would degenerate into four independent block ciphers the step in the step each column of the state is multiplied with fixed polynomial in the step the four bytes of each column of the state are combined using an invertible linear transformation the function takes four bytes as input and outputs four bytes where each input byte affects all four output bytes together with provides diffusion in the cipher during this operation each column is transformed using fixed matrix matrix left multiplied by column gives new value of column in the state matrix multiplication is composed of multiplication and addition of the entries entries are bytes treated as coefficients of polynomial of order addition is simply xor multiplication is modulo irreducible polynomial if processed bit by bit then after shifting conditional xor with should be performed if the shifted value is larger than ff overflow must be corrected by subtraction of generating polynomial these are special cases of the usual multiplication in in more general sense
