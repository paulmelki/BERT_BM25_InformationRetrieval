the native people of hokkaido sakhalin and the kurils early ainu speaking groups mostly hunters and fishermen migrated also into the kamchatka peninsula and into honshu were their descendants are today known as the matagi hunters which still use large amount of ainu vocabulary in their dialect other evidence for ainu speaking hunters and fishermen migrating down from northern hokkaido into

smallpox reduced the population although the increased contact created by the trade between the japanese and the ainu contributed to increased mutual understanding it also led to conflict which occasionally intensified into violent ainu revolts the most important was shakushain revolt an ainu rebellion against japanese authority another large scale revolt by ainu against japanese rule was

and fishermen who were told that taboo forbade them from bringing their wives to hokkaidō women were often tortured if they resisted rape by their new japanese husbands and frequently ran away into
