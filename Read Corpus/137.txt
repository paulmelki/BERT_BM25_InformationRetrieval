mig the most produced jet fighter in the world px the mil mi is the most produced helicopter in history the cessna skyhawk is the most produced aircraft in history an aircraft is vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air it counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil or in few cases the downward thrust from jet engines common examples of aircraft include airplanes helicopters airships including blimps gliders paramotors and hot air balloons the human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation the science of aviation including designing and building aircraft is called aeronautics crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot but unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self controlled by onboard computers aircraft may be classified by different criteria such as lift type aircraft propulsion usage and others history flying model craft and stories of manned flight go back many centuries however the first manned ascent and safe descent in modern times took place by larger hot air balloons developed in the th century each of the two world wars led to great technical advances consequently the history of aircraft can be divided into five eras pioneers of flight from the earliest experiments to first world war to aviation between the world wars to second world war to postwar era also called the jet age to the present day methods of lift lighter than air aerostats balloons aerostats use buoyancy to float in the air in much the same way that ships float on the water they are characterized by one or more large cells or canopies filled with relatively low density gas such as helium hydrogen or hot air which is less dense than the surrounding air when the weight of this is added to the weight of the aircraft structure it adds up to the same weight as the air that the craft displaces small hot air balloons called sky lanterns were first invented in ancient china prior to the rd century bc and used primarily in cultural celebrations and were only the second type of aircraft to fly the first being kites which were first invented in ancient china over two thousand years ago see han dynasty uss akron over manhattan in the balloon was originally any aerostat while the term airship was used for large powered aircraft designs usually fixed wing in frederick handley page was reported as referring to ships of the air with smaller passenger types as air yachts in the large flying boats were also sometimes referred to as ships of the air or flying ships though none had yet been built the advent of powered balloons called dirigible balloons and later of rigid hulls allowing great increase in size began to change the way these words were used huge powered aerostats characterized by rigid outer framework and separate aerodynamic skin surrounding the gas bags were produced the zeppelins being the largest and most famous there were still no fixed wing aircraft or non rigid balloons large enough to be called airships so airship came to be synonymous with these aircraft then several accidents such as the hindenburg disaster in led to the demise of these airships nowadays balloon is an unpowered aerostat and an airship is powered one powered steerable aerostat is called dirigible sometimes this term is applied only to non rigid balloons and sometimes dirigible balloon is regarded as the definition of an airship which may then be rigid or non rigid non rigid dirigibles are characterized by moderately aerodynamic gasbag with stabilizing fins at the back these soon became known as blimps during world war ii this shape was widely adopted for tethered balloons in windy weather this both reduces the strain on the tether and stabilizes the balloon the nickname blimp was adopted along with the shape in modern times any small dirigible or airship is called blimp though blimp may be unpowered as well as powered heavier than air aerodynes heavier than air aircraft such as airplanes must find some way to push air or gas downwards so that reaction occurs by newton laws of motion to push the aircraft upwards this dynamic movement through the air is the origin of the term aerodyne there are two ways to produce dynamic upthrust aerodynamic lift and powered lift in the form of engine thrust aerodynamic lift involving wings is the most common with fixed wing aircraft being kept in the air by the forward movement of wings and rotorcraft by spinning wing shaped rotors sometimes called rotary wings wing is flat horizontal surface usually shaped in cross section as an aerofoil to fly air must flow over the wing and generate lift flexible wing is wing made of fabric or thin sheet material often stretched over rigid frame kite is tethered to the ground and relies on the speed of the wind over its wings which may be flexible or rigid fixed or rotary with powered lift the aircraft directs its engine thrust vertically downward stol aircraft such as the harrier jump jet and lockheed martin take off and land vertically using powered lift and transfer to aerodynamic lift in steady flight pure rocket is not usually regarded as an aerodyne because it does not depend on the air for its lift and can even fly into space however many aerodynamic lift vehicles have been powered or assisted by rocket motors rocket powered missiles that obtain aerodynamic lift at very high speed due to airflow over their bodies are marginal case fixed wing an airbus the world largest passenger airliner the forerunner of the fixed wing aircraft is the kite whereas fixed wing aircraft relies on its forward speed to create airflow over the wings kite is tethered to the ground and relies on the wind blowing over its wings to provide lift kites were the first kind of aircraft to fly and were invented in
