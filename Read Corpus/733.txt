apollo was may human spaceflight the fourth crewed mission in the united states apollo program and the second after apollo to orbit the moon it was the fmission dress rehearsal for the first moon landing testing all the components and procedures just short of actually landing while astronaut john young remained in the command module orbiting the moon astronauts thomas stafford and gene cernan flew the apollo lunar module lm to descent orbit within of the lunar surface the point where powered descent for landing would begin after orbiting the moon times apollo returned safely to earth and its success enabled the first actual landing apollo two months later apollo set the record for the highest speed attained by crewed vehicle km km or mph on may during the return from the moon the

team pete frank orange team crew notes apollo and apollo were the only apollo missions whose crew were all veterans of spaceflight thomas stafford had flown on gemini and gemini john young had flown on gemini and gemini and eugene cernan had flown with stafford on gemini in addition apollo was the only saturnv flight from launch complex as preparations for apollo at lc had begun in march almost immediately after apollo launch they were also the only apollo crew all of whose members went on to fly subsequent missions aboard apollo spacecraft young later commanded apollo cernan commanded apollo and stafford commanded the vehicle on the apollo soyuz test project it was on apollo that john young became the first human to fly solo around the moon while stafford and cernan flew the lm in lunar orbit as part of the preparations for apollo young was also backup commander of apollo and apollo and cernan was backup commander of apollo the apollo crew are the humans who have traveled the farthest away from their houston homes at distance of though the apollo crew was km further away from earth as whole while most apollo missions orbited the moon at the same from the lunar surface the distance between the earth and moon varies by about between perigee and apogee throughout each lunar month and the earth rotation makes the distance to houston vary by at most another each day the apollo crew reached the farthest point in their orbit around the far side of the moon at about the same time earth rotation put houston nearly full earth diameter away by the normal rotation in place during apollo the backup crew would have been scheduled to fly on apollo however alan shepard then number two at the astronaut office gave himself the apollo command slot instead gordon cooper jr commander of the apollo backup crew was enraged and resigned from nasa deke slayton the director of the flight crew operations also removed donn eisele from the crew due to the personal misconduct and professional misconduct in the apollo mission and was replaced by stuart roosa later shepard crew was forced to switch places with jim lovell tentative apollo crew slayton wrote in his memoirs that cooper and eisele were never intended to rotate to another mission as both were out of favor with nasa management for various reasons cooper for his lax attitude towards training and eisele for incidents aboard apollo plus an extramarital affair and were assigned to the backup crew simply because of lack of qualified manpower in the astronaut office at the time the assignment needed to be made cooper slayton noted had very small chance of receiving the apollo command if he did an outstanding job with the assignment which he did not eisele despite his issues with management was always intended for future assignment to the apollo applications program which was eventually cut down to only the skylab component and not lunar mission objectives comparison of lm weights apollo lm apollo

the point where powered descent would begin on the actual landing practicing this approach orbit would refine knowledge of the lunar gravitational field needed to calibrate the powered descent guidance system to within needed for landing earth based observations uncrewed spacecraft and apollo had respectively allowed calibration to within and except for this final stretch the mission was designed to duplicate how landing would have gone both in space and for ground control putting nasa flight controllers and extensive tracking and control network through rehearsal the ascent stage was loaded with the amount of fuel and oxidizer it would have had remaining if it had lifted off from the surface and reached the altitude at which the apollo ascent stage fired this was only about half the total amount required for lift off and rendezvous with the csm the mission loaded lm weighed compared to for the apollo lm which made the first landing craig nelson wrote in his book rocket men that nasa took special precaution to ensure stafford and cernan would not attempt to make the first landing nelson quoted cernan as saying lot of people thought about the kind of people we were don give those guys an opportunity to land cause they might so the ascent module the part we lifted off the lunar surface with was short fueled the fuel tanks weren full so had we literally tried to land on the moon we couldn have gotten off mission parameters mass csm lm earth parking orbit perigee apogee inclination period min lunar orbit perilune apolune inclination period
