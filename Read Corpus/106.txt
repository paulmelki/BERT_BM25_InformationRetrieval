flowchart of an algorithm euclid algorithm for calculating the greatest common divisor of two numbers and in locations named and the algorithm proceeds by successive subtractions in two loops if the test yields yes or true more accurately the number in location is greater than or equal to the number in location then the algorithm specifies meaning the number replaces the old similarly if then the process terminates when the contents of is yielding the in algorithm derived from scott symbols and drawing style from tausworthe ada lovelace diagram from note the first published computer algorithm in mathematics and computer science an algorithm is finite sequence of well defined computer implementable instructions typically to solve class of problems or to perform computation algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations data processing automated reasoning and other tasks as an effective method an algorithm can be expressed within finite amount of space and time and in well defined formal language for calculating function starting from an initial state and initial input perhaps empty the instructions describe computation that when executed proceeds through finite number of well defined successive states eventually producing output and terminating at final ending state the transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic some algorithms known as randomized algorithms incorporate random input the concept of algorithm has existed since antiquity arithmetic algorithms such as division algorithm was used by ancient babylonian mathematicians bc and egyptian mathematicians bc greek mathematicians later used algorithms in the sieve of eratosthenes for finding prime numbers and the euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers arabic mathematicians such as al kindi in the th century used cryptographic algorithms for code breaking based on frequency analysis the word algorithm itself is derived from the name of the th century mathematician muḥammad ibn mūsā al khwārizmī whose nisba identifying him as from khwarazm was latinized as algoritmi partial formalization of what would become the modern concept of algorithm began with attempts to solve the decision problem posed by david hilbert in later formalizations were framed as attempts to define effective calculability or effective method those formalizations included the gödel herbrand kleene recursive functions of and alonzo church lambda calculus of emil post formulation of and alan turing turing machines of and etymology the word algorithm has its roots in latinizing the nisba indicating his geographic origin of the name of persian mathematician muhammad ibn musa al khwarizmi to algorismus al khwārizmī arabized persian الخوارزمی was mathematician astronomer geographer and scholar in the house of wisdom in baghdad whose name means the native of khwarazm region that was part of greater iran and is now in uzbekistan about al khwarizmi wrote an arabic language treatise on the hindu arabic numeral system which was translated into latin during the th century the manuscript starts with the phrase dixit algorizmi thus spake al khwarizmi where algorizmi was the translator latinization of al khwarizmi name al khwarizmi was the most widely read mathematician in europe in the late middle ages primarily through another of his books the algebra in late medieval latin algorismus english algorism the corruption of his name simply meant the decimal number system in the th century under the influence of the greek word ἀριθμός arithmos number cf arithmetic the latin word was altered to algorithmus and the corresponding english term algorithm is first attested in the th century the modern sense was introduced in the th century in english it was first used in about and then by chaucer in english adopted the french term but it wasn until the late th century that algorithm took on the meaning that it has in modern english another early use of the word is from in manual titled carmen de algorismo composed by alexandre de villedieu it begins with which translates to the poem is few hundred lines long and summarizes the art of calculating with the new styled indian dice tali indorum or hindu numerals informal definition an informal definition could be set of rules that precisely defines sequence of operations which would include all computer programs including programs that do not perform numeric calculations and for example any prescribed bureaucratic procedure or cook book recipe in general program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually even though infinite loops may sometimes prove desirable prototypical example of an algorithm is the euclidean algorithm which is used to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers an example there are others is described by the flowchart above and as an example in later section offer an informal meaning of the word algorithm in the following quotation no human being can write fast enough or long enough or small enough smaller and smaller without limit you be trying to write on molecules on atoms on electrons to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names one after another in some notation but humans can do something equally useful in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets they can give explicit instructions for determining the th member of the set for arbitrary finite such instructions are to be given quite explicitly in form in which they could be followed by computing machine or by human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols an enumerably infinite set is one whose elements can be put into one to one correspondence with the integers thus boolos and jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for process that creates output integers from an arbitrary input integer or integers that in theory can be arbitrarily large for example an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as two arbitrary input variables and that produce an output but various authors attempts to define the notion indicate that the word implies much more than this something on the order of for the addition example precise instructions in language understood by the computer
