artificial omni directional sound source in an anechoic chamber acoustics is branch of physics that deals with the study of mechanical waves in gases liquids and solids including topics such as vibration sound ultrasound and infrasound scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an acoustician while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be called an acoustical engineer the application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and noise control industries hearing is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world and speech is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture accordingly the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of human society music medicine architecture industrial production warfare and more likewise animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as key element of mating rituals or marking territories art craft science and technology have provoked one another to advance the whole as in many other fields of knowledge robert bruce lindsay wheel of acoustics is well accepted overview of the various fields in acoustics history etymology the word acoustic is derived from the greek word ἀκουστικός akoustikos meaning of or for hearing ready to hear and that from ἀκουστός akoustos heard audible which in turn derives from the verb ἀκούω akouo hear the latin synonym is sonic after which the term sonics used to be synonym for acoustics and later branch of acoustics frequencies above and below the audible range are called ultrasonic and infrasonic respectively early research in acoustics fundamental and the first overtones of vibrating string the earliest records of the study of this phenomenon are attributed to the philosopher pythagoras in the th century bc in the th century bc the ancient greek philosopher pythagoras wanted to know why some combinations of musical sounds seemed more beautiful than others and he found answers in terms of numerical ratios representing the harmonic overtone series on string he is reputed to have observed that when the lengths of vibrating strings are expressible as ratios of integers to to the tones produced will be harmonious and the smaller the integers the more harmonious the sounds for example string of certain length would sound particularly harmonious with string of twice the length other factors being equal in modern parlance if string sounds the note when plucked string twice as long will sound an octave lower in one system of musical tuning the tones in between are then given by for for for for for and for in ascending order aristotle bc understood that sound consisted of compressions and rarefactions of air which falls upon and strikes the air which is next to it very good expression of the nature of wave motion on things heard generally ascribed to strato of lampsacus states that the pitch is related to the frequency of vibrations of the air and to the speed of sound in about bc the roman architect and engineer vitruvius wrote treatise on the acoustic properties of theaters including discussion of interference echoes and reverberation the beginnings of architectural acoustics in book of his de architectura the ten books of architecture vitruvius describes sound as wave comparable to water wave extended to three dimensions which when interrupted by obstructions would flow back and break up following waves he described the ascending seats in ancient theaters as designed to prevent this deterioration of sound and also recommended bronze vessels of appropriate sizes be placed in theaters to resonate with the fourth fifth and so on up to the double octave in order to resonate with the more desirable harmonious notes during the islamic golden age abū rayhān al bīrūnī is believed to postulated that the speed of sound was much slower than the speed of light roman theatre in the city of amman the physical understanding of acoustical processes advanced rapidly during and after the scientific revolution mainly galileo galilei but also marin mersenne independently discovered the complete laws of vibrating strings completing what pythagoras and pythagoreans had started years earlier galileo wrote waves are produced by the vibrations of sonorous body which spread through the air bringing to the tympanum of the ear stimulus which the mind interprets as sound remarkable statement that points to the beginnings of physiological and psychological acoustics experimental measurements of the speed of sound in air were carried out successfully between and by number of investigators prominently mersenne meanwhile newton derived the relationship for wave velocity in solids cornerstone of physical acoustics principia age of enlightenment and onward substantial progress in acoustics resting on firmer mathematical and physical concepts was made during the eighteenth century by euler lagrange and alembert during this era continuum physics or field theory began to receive definite mathematical structure the wave equation emerged in number of contexts including the propagation of sound in air in the nineteenth century the major figures of mathematical acoustics were helmholtz in germany who consolidated the field of physiological acoustics and lord rayleigh in england who combined the previous knowledge with his own copious contributions to the field in his monumental work the theory of sound also in the th century wheatstone ohm and henry developed the analogy between electricity and acoustics the twentieth century saw burgeoning of technological applications of the large body of scientific knowledge that was by then in place the first such application was sabine groundbreaking work in architectural acoustics and many others followed underwater acoustics was used for detecting submarines in the first world war sound recording and the telephone played important roles in global transformation of society sound measurement and analysis reached new levels of accuracy and sophistication through the use of electronics and computing the ultrasonic frequency range enabled wholly new kinds of application in medicine and industry new kinds of transducers generators and receivers of acoustic energy were invented and put to use fundamental concepts of acoustics definition acoustics is defined
