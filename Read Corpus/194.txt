acute disseminated adem or acute demyelinating is rare autoimmune disease marked by sudden widespread attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord as well as causing the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed adem also attacks the nerves of the central nervous system and damages their myelin insulation which as result destroys the white matter it is often triggered by viral infection or very rarely specific non routine vaccinations adem symptoms resemble the symptoms of multiple sclerosis ms so the disease itself is sorted into the classification of the multiple sclerosis borderline diseases however adem has several features that distinguish it from ms unlike ms adem occurs usually in children and is marked with rapid fever although adolescents and adults can get the disease too adem consists of single flare up whereas ms is marked with several flare ups or relapses over long period of time relapses following adem are reported in up to quarter of patients but the majority of these multiphasic presentations following adem likely represent ms adem is also distinguished by loss of consciousness coma and death which is very rare in ms except in severe cases it affects about per people per year although it occurs in all ages most reported cases are in children and adolescents with the average age around to years old the disease affects males and females almost equally adem shows seasonal variation with higher incidence in winter and spring months which may coincide with higher viral infections during these months the mortality rate may be as high as however full recovery is seen in to of cases with increase in survival rates up to to with figures including minor residual disability as well the average time to recover from adem flare ups is one to six months adem produces multiple inflammatory lesions in the brain and spinal cord particularly in the white matter usually these are found in the subcortical and central white matter and cortical gray white junction of both cerebral hemispheres cerebellum brainstem and spinal cord but periventricular white matter and gray matter of the cortex thalami and basal ganglia may also be involved when person has more than one demyelinating episode of adem the disease is then called recurrent disseminated or multiphasic disseminated mdem also fulminant course in adults has been described signs and symptoms adem has an abrupt onset and monophasic course symptoms usually begin weeks after infection major symptoms include fever headache nausea and vomiting confusion vision impairment drowsiness seizures and coma although initially the symptoms are usually mild they worsen rapidly over the course of hours to days with the average time to maximum severity being about four and half days additional symptoms include hemiparesis paraparesis and cranial nerve palsies causes since the discovery of the anti mog specificity against multiple sclerosis diagnosis it is considered that adem is one of the possible clinical causes of anti mog associated about how the anti mog antibodies appear in the patients serum there are several theories preceding antigenic challenge can be identified in approximately two thirds of people some viral infections thought to induce adem include influenza virus dengue enterovirus measles mumps rubella varicella zoster epstein barr virus cytomegalovirus herpes simplex virus hepatitis coxsackievirus and covid bacterial infections include mycoplasma pneumoniae borrelia burgdorferi leptospira and beta hemolytic streptococci exposure to vaccines the only vaccine proven related to adem is the semple form of the rabies vaccine but hepatitis pertussis diphtheria measles mumps rubella pneumococcus varicella influenza japanese encephalitis and polio vaccines have all been implicated the majority of the studies that correlate vaccination with adem onset use small samples or case studies large scale epidemiological studies of mmr vaccine or smallpox vaccine do not show increased risk of adem following vaccination an upper bound for the risk of adem from measles vaccination if it exists can be estimated to be per million which is far lower than the risk of developing adem from an actual measles infection which is about per cases for rubella infection the risk is per cases some early vaccines later shown to have been contaminated with host animal cns tissue had adem incident rates as high as in in rare cases adem seems to follow from organ transplantation diagnosis adem term has been inconsistently used at different times currently the commonly accepted international standard for the clinical case definition is the one published by the international pediatric ms study group revision given that the definition is clinical it is currently unknown if all the cases with adem are positive for anti mog autoantibody but in any case it seems strongly related to adem diagnosis differential diagnosis multiple sclerosis while adem and ms both involve autoimmune demyelination they differ in many clinical genetic imaging and aspects some authors consider ms and its borderline forms to constitute spectrum differing only in chronicity severity and clinical course while others consider them discretely different diseases typically adem appears in children following an antigenic challenge and remains monophasic nevertheless adem does occur in adults and can also be clinically multiphasic problems for differential diagnosis increase due to the lack of agreement for definition of multiple sclerosis if ms were defined just by the separation in time and space of the demyelinating lesions as mcdonald did it would not be enough to make difference as some cases of adem satisfy these conditions therefore some authors propose to establish the separation line in the shape of the lesions around the veins being therefore perivenous vs confluent demyelination acute hemorrhagic in patient with multiple sclerosis the pathology of adem is very similar to that of ms with some differences the pathological hallmark of adem is perivenular inflammation with limited sleeves of demyelination nevertheless ms like plaques confluent demyelination can appear plaques in the white matter in ms are sharply delineated while the glial scar in adem is smooth axons are better preserved in adem lesions inflammation in adem is widely disseminated and ill defined and finally lesions are strictly
