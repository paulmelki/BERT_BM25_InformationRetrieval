abiotic stress is the negative impact of non living factors on the living organisms in specific environment the non living variable must influence the environment beyond its normal range of variation to adversely affect the population performance or individual physiology of the organism in significant way whereas biotic stress would include living disturbances such as fungi or harmful insects abiotic stress factors or stressors are naturally occurring often intangible and inanimate factors such as intense sunlight temperature or wind that may cause harm to the plants and animals in the area affected abiotic stress is essentially unavoidable abiotic stress affects animals but plants are especially dependent if not solely dependent on environmental factors so it is particularly constraining abiotic stress is the most harmful factor concerning the growth and productivity of crops worldwide research has also shown that abiotic stressors are at their most harmful when they occur together in combinations of abiotic stress factors examples abiotic stress comes in many forms the most common of the stressors are the easiest for people to identify but there are many other less recognizable abiotic stress factors which affect environments constantly the most basic stressors include high winds extreme temperatures drought flood other natural disasters such as tornadoes and wildfires cold heat lesser known stressors generally occur on smaller scale they include poor edaphic conditions like rock content and ph levels high radiation compaction contamination and other highly specific conditions like rapid rehydration during seed germination effects abiotic stress as natural part of every ecosystem will affect organisms in variety of ways although these effects may be either beneficial or detrimental the location of the area is crucial in determining the extent of the impact that abiotic stress will have the higher the latitude of the area affected the greater the impact of abiotic stress will be on that area so taiga or boreal forest is at the mercy of whatever abiotic stress factors may come along while tropical zones are much less susceptible to such stressors benefits one example of situation where abiotic stress plays constructive role in an ecosystem is in natural wildfires while they can be human safety hazard it is productive for these ecosystems to burn out every once in while so that new organisms can begin to grow and thrive even though it is healthy for an ecosystem wildfire can still be considered an abiotic stressor because it puts an obvious stress on individual organisms within the area every tree that is scorched and each bird nest that is devoured is sign of the abiotic stress on the larger scale though natural wildfires are positive manifestations of abiotic stress what also needs to be taken into account when looking for benefits of abiotic stress is that one phenomenon may not affect an entire ecosystem in the same way while flood will kill most plants living low on the ground in certain area if there is rice there it will thrive in the wet conditions another example of this is in phytoplankton and zooplankton the same types of conditions are usually considered stressful for these two types of organisms they act very similarly when exposed to ultraviolet light and most toxins but at elevated temperatures the phytoplankton reacts negatively while the thermophilic zooplankton reacts positively to the increase in temperature the two may be living in the same environment but an increase in temperature of the area would prove stressful only for one of the organisms lastly abiotic stress has enabled species to grow develop and evolve furthering natural selection as it picks out the weakest of group of organisms both plants and animals have evolved mechanisms allowing them to survive extremes detriments the most obvious detriment concerning abiotic stress involves farming it has been claimed by one study that abiotic stress causes the most crop loss of any other factor and that most major crops are reduced in their yield by more than from their potential yield because abiotic stress is widely considered detrimental effect the research on this branch of the issue is extensive for more information on the harmful effects of abiotic stress see the sections below on plants and animals in plants plant first line of defense against abiotic stress is in its roots if the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse the plant will have higher chance of surviving stressful conditions the plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress for example transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved one of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the na ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell high concentrations of na for example can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis have led to wide variety of stress tolerant plants facilitation or the positive interactions between different species of plants is an intricate web of association in natural environment it is how plants work together in areas of high stress the level of facilitation is especially high as well this could possibly be because the plants need stronger network to survive in harsher environment so their interactions between species such as cross pollination or mutualistic actions become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat plants also adapt very differently from one another even from plant living in the same area when group of different plant species was prompted by variety of different stress signals such as drought or cold each plant responded uniquely hardly any of the responses were similar even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment sunflowers are plants that can absorb large amount of metal serpentine soils
