alternative medicine is any practice that aims to achieve the healing effects of medicine but which lacks biological plausibility and is untested untestable or proven ineffective complementary medicine cm complementary and alternative medicine cam integrated medicine or integrative medicine im and holistic medicine are among many rebrandings of the same phenomenon alternative therapies share in common that they reside outside medical science and rely on pseudoscience traditional practices become alternative when used outside their original settings without proper scientific explanation and evidence frequently used derogatory terms for the alternative are new age or pseudo with little distinction from quackery some alternative practices are based on theories that contradict the science of how the human body works others resort to the supernatural or superstitious to explain their effect in others the practice is plausibly effective but has too many side effects alternative medicine is distinct from scientific medicine which employs the scientific method to test plausible therapies by way of responsible and ethical clinical trials producing evidence of either effect or of no effect research into alternative therapies often fails to follow proper research protocols such as placebo controlled trials blind experiments and calculation of prior probability providing invalid results much of the perceived effect of an alternative practice arises from belief that it will be effective the placebo effect or from the treated condition resolving on its own the natural course of disease this is further exacerbated by the tendency to turn to alternative therapies upon the failure of medicine at which point the condition will be at its worst and most likely to spontaneously improve in the absence of this bias especially for diseases that are not expected to get better by themselves such as cancer or hiv infection multiple studies have shown significantly worse outcomes if patients turn to alternative therapies while this may be because these patients avoid effective treatment some alternative therapies are actively harmful cyanide poisoning from amygdalin or the intentional ingestion of hydrogen peroxide or actively interfere with effective treatments the alternative sector is highly profitable industry with strong lobby and faces far less regulation over the use and marketing of unproven treatments its marketing often advertises the treatments as being natural or holistic in comparison to those offered by big pharma billions of dollars have been spent studying alternative medicine with few or no positive results some of the successful practices are only considered alternative under very specific definitions such as those which include all physical activity under the umbrella of alternative medicine definitions and terminology the terms alternative medicine complementary medicine integrative medicine holistic medicine natural medicine unorthodox medicine fringe medicine unconventional medicine and new age medicine are used interchangeably as having the same meaning and are almost synonymous in most contexts terminology has shifted over time reflecting the preferred branding of practitioners for example the united states national institutes of health department studying alternative medicine currently named the national center for complementary and integrative health nccih was established as the office of alternative medicine oam and was renamed the national center for complementary and alternative medicine nccam before obtaining its current name therapies are often framed as natural or holistic implicitly and intentionally suggesting that conventional medicine is artificial and narrow in scope marcia angell there cannot be two kinds of medicine conventional and alternative the meaning of the term alternative in the expression alternative medicine is not that it is an effective alternative to medical science although some alternative medicine promoters may use the loose terminology to give the appearance of effectiveness loose terminology may also be used to suggest meaning that dichotomy exists when it does not the use of the expressions western medicine and eastern medicine to suggest that the difference is cultural difference between the asiatic east and the european west rather than that the difference is between evidence based medicine and treatments that do not work alternative medicine alternative medicine is defined loosely as set of products practices and theories that are believed or perceived by their users to have the healing effects of medicine but whose effectiveness has not been established using scientific methods or whose theory and practice is not part of biomedicine or whose theories or practices are directly contradicted by scientific evidence or scientific principles used in biomedicine biomedicine or medicine is that part of medical science that applies principles of biology physiology molecular biology biophysics and other natural sciences to clinical practice using scientific methods to establish the effectiveness of that practice unlike medicine an alternative product or practice does not originate from using scientific methods but may instead be based on hearsay religion tradition superstition belief in supernatural energies pseudoscience errors in reasoning propaganda fraud or other unscientific sources some other definitions seek to specify alternative medicine in terms of its social and political marginality to mainstream healthcare this can refer to the lack of support that alternative therapies receive from medical scientists regarding access to research funding sympathetic coverage in the medical press or inclusion in the standard medical curriculum for example widely used definition devised by the us nccih calls it group of diverse medical and health care systems practices and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine however these descriptive definitions are inadequate in the present day when some conventional doctors offer alternative medical treatments and introductory courses or modules can be offered as part of standard undergraduate medical training alternative medicine is taught in more than half of us medical schools and us health insurers are increasingly willing to provide reimbursement for alternative therapies complementary or integrative medicine complementary medicine cm or integrative medicine im is when alternative medicine is used together with functional medical treatment in belief that it improves the effect of treatments for example acupuncture piercing the body with needles to influence the flow of supernatural energy might be believed to increase the effectiveness or complement science based medicine when used at the same time instead significant drug interactions caused
