the approximate positions of some germanic peoples reported by graeco roman authors in the st century suevian peoples in red and other irminones in purple the angles were one of the main germanic peoples who settled in great britain in the post roman period they founded several kingdoms in anglo saxon england and their name is the root of the name england land of ængle according to tacitus writing before their move to britain angles lived alongside langobardi and semnones in historical regions of schleswig and holstein which are today part of southern denmark and northern germany schleswig holstein etymology the name of the angles may have been first recorded in latinised form as anglii in the germania of tacitus it is thought to derive from the name of the area they originally inhabited the anglia peninsula angeln in modern german angel in danish this name has been hypothesised to originate from the germanic root for narrow compare german and dutch eng narrow meaning the narrow water the schlei estuary the root would be h₂enǵʰ tight another theory is that the name meant hook as in angling for fish in reference to the shape of the peninsula indo european linguist julius pokorny derives it from proto indo european h₂enk bend see ankle alternatively the angles may have been called such because they were fishing people or were originally descended from such during the fifth century all germanic tribes who invaded britain were referred to as either englisc ængle or engle who were all speakers of old english which was known as englisc ænglisc or anglisc englisc and its descendant english also goes back to proto indo european h₂enǵʰ meaning narrow gregory the great in an epistle simplified the latinised name anglii to angli the latter form developing into the preferred form of the word the country remained anglia in latin alfred the great translation of orosius history of the world uses angelcynn kin to describe the english people bede uses angelfolc folk also such forms as engel englan the people englaland and englisc occur all showing mutation greco roman historiography tacitus anglia angeln and the schwansen peninsulas possible locations of the angles and jutes before their migration to britain the earliest known mention of the angles may be in chapter of tacitus germania written around ad tacitus describes the anglii as one of the more remote suebic tribes compared to the semnones and langobardi who lived on the elbe and were better known to the romans he grouped the angles with several other tribes in that region the reudigni aviones varini eudoses suarini and nuitones these were all living behind ramparts of rivers and woods and therefore inaccessible to attack he gives no precise indication of their geographical situation but states that together with the six other tribes they worshipped nerthus or mother earth whose sanctuary was located on an island in the ocean the eudoses are the jutes these names probably refer to localities in jutland or on the baltic coast the coast contains sufficient estuaries inlets rivers islands swamps and marshes to have been then inaccessible to those not familiar with the terrain such as the romans who considered it unknown inaccessible with small population and of little economic interest the majority of scholars believe that the anglii lived on the coasts of the baltic sea probably in the southern part of the jutland peninsula this view is based partly on old english and danish traditions regarding persons and events of the fourth century and partly because striking affinities to the cult of nerthus as described by tacitus are to be found in pre christian scandinavian religion ptolemy ptolemy writing in around ad in his atlas geography describes them in confusing manner in one passage the sueboi angeilloi in greek equivalent to latin spelling suevi angili are living in stretch of land between the northern rhine and central elbe but apparently not touching either river with the suebic langobardi on the rhine to their west and the suebic semnones on the elbe stretching to their east this is unexpected however as pointed out by schütte the langobards also appear as the laccobardi in another position near the elbe and the saxons which is considered more likely to be correct and the angles probably lived in that region also owing to the uncertainty of this passage much speculation existed regarding the original home of the anglii one theory is that they or part of them dwelt or moved among other coastal people perhaps confederated up to the basin of the saale in the neighbourhood of the ancient canton of engilin on the unstrut valleys below the kyffhäuserkreis from which region the lex anglorum et werinorum hoc est thuringorum is believed by many to have come the ethnic names of frisians and warines are also attested in these saxon districts second possible solution is that these angles of ptolemy are not those of schleswig at all according to julius pokorny the angri in angrivarii the angr in hardanger and the angl in anglii all come from the same root meaning bend but in different senses in other words the similarity of the names is strictly coincidental and does not reflect any ethnic unity beyond germanic gudmund schütte in his analysis of ptolemy believes that the angles have simply been moved by an error coming from ptolemy use of imperfect sources he points out that angles are placed correctly just to the northeast of the langobardi but that these have been duplicated so that they appear once correctly on the lower elbe and second time incorrectly at the northern rhine medieval historiography manuscript of bede bede states that the anglii before coming to great britain dwelt in land called angulus which lies between the province of the jutes and the saxons and remains unpopulated to this day similar evidence is given by the historia brittonum king alfred the great and the chronicler æthelweard identified this place with anglia in the province
