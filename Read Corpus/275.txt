the square root of is an algebraic number equal to the length of the hypotenuse of right triangle with legs of length an algebraic number is any complex number including real numbers that is root of non zero polynomial that is value which causes the polynomial to equal in one variable with rational coefficients or equivalently by clearing denominators with integer coefficients all integers and rational numbers are algebraic as are all roots of integers real and complex numbers that are not algebraic such as and are called transcendental numbers while the set of complex numbers is uncountable the set of algebraic numbers is countable and has measure zero in the lebesgue measure as subset of the complex numbers in this sense almost all complex numbers are transcendental examples all rational numbers are algebraic any rational number expressed as the quotient of an integer and non zero natural number satisfies the above definition because is the root of non zero polynomial namely the quadratic surds irrational roots of quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients and are algebraic numbers if the quadratic polynomial is monic then the roots are further qualified as quadratic integers the constructible numbers are those numbers that can be constructed from given unit length using straightedge and compass these include all quadratic surds all rational numbers and all numbers that can be formed from these using the basic arithmetic operations and the extraction of square roots by designating cardinal directions for and complex numbers such as are considered constructible any expression formed from algebraic numbers using any combination of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of th roots gives another algebraic number polynomial roots that cannot be expressed in terms of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of th roots such as the roots of this happens with many but not all polynomials of degree or higher gaussian integers those complex numbers where both and are integers and are also quadratic integers values of trigonometric functions of rational multiples of except when undefined that is the trigonometric numbers for example each of satisfies this polynomial is irreducible over the rationals and so these three cosines are conjugate algebraic numbers likewise all satisfy the irreducible polynomial and so are conjugate algebraic integers some irrational numbers are algebraic and some are not the numbers and are algebraic since they are roots of polynomials and respectively the golden ratio is algebraic since it is root of the polynomial the numbers and are not algebraic numbers see the lindemann weierstrass theorem properties algebraic numbers on the complex plane colored by degree red green blue yellow given an algebraic number there is unique monic polynomial with rational coefficients of least degree that has the number as root this polynomial is called its minimal polynomial if its minimal polynomial has degree then the algebraic number is said to be of degree for example all rational numbers have degree and an algebraic number of degree is quadratic irrational the real algebraic numbers are dense in the reals linearly ordered and without first or last element and therefore order isomorphic to the set of rational numbers the set of algebraic numbers is countable enumerable and therefore its lebesgue measure as subset of the complex numbers is essentially the algebraic numbers take up no space in the complex numbers that is to say almost all real and complex numbers are transcendental all algebraic numbers are computable and therefore definable and arithmetical for real numbers and the complex number is algebraic if and only if both and are algebraic the field of algebraic numbers algebraic numbers colored by degree blue cyan red green the unit circle is black the sum difference product and quotient if the denominator is nonzero of two algebraic numbers is again algebraic this fact can be demonstrated using the resultant and the algebraic numbers therefore form field sometimes denoted by though this usually denotes the adele ring every root of polynomial equation whose coefficients are algebraic numbers is again algebraic this can be rephrased by saying that the field of algebraic numbers is algebraically closed in fact it is the smallest algebraically closed field containing the rationals and is therefore called the algebraic closure of the rationals the set of real algebraic numbers itself forms field related fields numbers defined by radicals all numbers that can be obtained from the integers using finite number of complex additions subtractions multiplications divisions and taking th roots where is positive integer radical expressions are algebraic the converse however is not true there are algebraic numbers that cannot be obtained in this manner these numbers are roots of polynomials of degree or higher result of galois theory see quintic equations and the abel ruffini theorem an example is where the unique real root is where is the generalized hypergeometric function closed form number algebraic numbers are all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials starting from the rational numbers one may generalize this to closed form numbers which may be defined in various ways most broadly all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials exponentials and logarithms are called elementary numbers and these include the algebraic numbers plus some transcendental numbers most narrowly one may consider numbers explicitly defined in terms of polynomials exponentials and logarithms this does not include all algebraic numbers but does include some simple transcendental numbers such as or ln algebraic integers algebraic numbers colored by leading coefficient red signifies for an algebraic integer an algebraic integer is an algebraic number that is root of polynomial with integer coefficients with leading coefficient monic polynomial examples of algebraic integers are and therefore the algebraic integers constitute proper superset of the integers as the latter are the roots of monic polynomials for all in this sense algebraic integers are to algebraic numbers what integers are to rational numbers the sum difference and product of algebraic integers are again algebraic integers which means that the algebraic integers
