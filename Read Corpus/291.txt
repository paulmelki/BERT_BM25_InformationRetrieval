name of the city of athens athena is associated with the city of athens the name of the city in ancient greek is plural toponym designating the place where according to myth she presided over the athenai sisterhood devoted to her worship in ancient times scholars argued whether athena was named after athens or athens after athena now scholars generally agree that the goddess takes her name from the city the ending ene is common in names of locations but rare for personal names testimonies from different cities in ancient greece attest that similar city goddesses were worshipped in other cities and like athena took their names from the cities where they were worshipped for example in mycenae there was goddess called mykene whose sisterhood was known as mykenai whereas at thebes an analogous deity was called thebe and the city was known under the plural form thebai or thebes in english where the is the plural formation the name athenai is likely of pre greek origin because it contains the presumably pre greek morpheme ƒÅn in his dialogue cratylus the ancient greek philosopher plato bc gives some rather imaginative etymologies of athena name based on the theories of the ancient athenians and his own etymological speculations thus plato believed that athena name was derived from greek which the later greeks rationalised as from the deity mind the second century ad orator aelius aristides attempted to derive natural symbols from the etymological roots of athena names to be aether air earth and moon origins fragment of fresco from the cult center at mycenae dating the late thirteenth century bc depicting warrior goddess possibly athena wearing boar tusk helmet and clutching griffin athena was originally the aegean goddess of the palace who presided over household crafts and protected the king single mycenaean greek inscription athana potnia appears at knossos in the linear tablets from the late minoan ii era room of the chariot tablets these comprise the earliest linear archive anywhere although athana potnia is often translated as mistress athena it could also mean the potnia of athana or the lady of athens however any connection to the city of athens in the knossos inscription is uncertain sign series appears in the still undeciphered corpus of linear tablets written in the unclassified minoan language this could be connected with the linear mycenaean expressions and or diwia of zeus or possibly related to homonymous goddess resulting in translation athena of zeus or divine athena similarly in the greek mythology and epic tradition athena figures as daughter of zeus cfr dyeus however the inscription quoted seems to be very similar to quoted as sy za by jan best best translates the initial which is recurrent in line beginnings as have given mycenean fresco depicts two women extending their hands towards central figure who is covered by an enormous figure eight shield this may depict the warrior goddess with her palladion or her palladion in an aniconic representation in the procession fresco at knossos which was reconstructed by the mycenaeans two rows of figures carrying vessels seem to meet in front of central figure which is probably the minoan precursor to athena the early twentieth century scholar martin persson nilsson argued that the minoan snake goddess figurines are early representations of athena nilsson and others have claimed that in early times athena was either an owl herself or bird goddess in general in the third book
