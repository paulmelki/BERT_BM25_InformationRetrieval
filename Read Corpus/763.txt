atle selberg june august was norwegian mathematician known for his work in analytic number theory and the theory of automorphic forms and in particular for bringing them into relation with spectral theory he was awarded the fields medal in early years selberg was born in langesund norway the son of teacher anna kristina selberg and mathematician ole michael ludvigsen selberg two of his three brothers sigmund and henrik were also mathematicians his other brother arne was professor of engineering while he was still at school he was influenced by the work of srinivasa ramanujan and he found an exact analytical formula for the partition function as suggested by the works of ramanujan however this result was first published by hans rademacher during the war he fought against the german invasion of norway and was imprisoned several times he studied at the university of oslo and completed his ph in world war ii during world war ii selberg worked in isolation due to the german occupation of norway after the war his accomplishments became known including proof that positive proportion of the zeros of the riemann zeta function lie on the line after the war he turned to sieve theory previously neglected topic which selberg work brought into prominence in paper he introduced the selberg sieve method well adapted in particular to providing auxiliary upper bounds and which contributed to chen theorem among other important results in selberg submitted two papers in annals of mathematics in which he proved by elementary means the theorems for primes in arithmetic progression and the density of primes this challenged the widely held view of his time that certain theorems are only obtainable with the advanced methods of complex analysis both results were based on his work on the asymptotic formula where for primes he established this result by elementary means in march and by july of that year selberg and paul erd≈ës each obtained elementary proofs of the prime number theorem both using the asymptotic formula above as starting point circumstances leading up to the proofs as well as publication disagreements led to bitter dispute between the two mathematicians for his fundamental accomplishments during the selberg received the fields medal institute for advanced study selberg moved to the united states and worked as an associate professor at syracuse university and later settled at the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey in the where he remained until his death during the he worked on introducing spectral theory into number theory culminating in his development of the selberg trace formula the most famous and influential of his results in its simplest form this establishes duality between the lengths of closed geodesics on compact riemann surface and the eigenvalues of the laplacian which is analogous to the duality between the prime numbers and the zeros of the zeta function he was awarded the wolf prize in mathematics he was also awarded an honorary abel prize in its founding year before the awarding of the regular prizes began selberg received many distinctions for his work in addition to the fields medal the wolf prize and the gunnerus medal he was elected to the norwegian academy of science and letters the royal danish academy of sciences and letters and the american academy of arts and sciences in he was awarded an honorary degree doctor philos honoris causa at the norwegian institute of technology later part of norwegian university of science and technology selberg had two children ingrid selberg and lars selberg ingrid selberg is married to playwright mustapha matura he died at home in princeton new jersey on august of heart failure selected publications atle selberg collected papers springer verlag heidelberg collected papers springer verlag heidelberg mai references further reading albers donald and alexanderson gerald fascinating mathematical people interviews and memoirs atle selberg pp princeton university press interview with selberg external links atle selberg archive webpage obituary at ias obituary in the times atle selbergs private archive exists at ntnu university library
