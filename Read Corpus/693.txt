digital image of plasmid restriction digests run on agarose gel volt cm stained with ethidium bromide the dna size marker is commercial kbp ladder the position of the wells and direction of dna migration is noted agarose gel electrophoresis is method of gel electrophoresis used in biochemistry molecular biology genetics and clinical chemistry to separate mixed population of macromolecules such as dna or proteins in matrix of agarose one of the two main components of agar the proteins may be separated by charge and or size isoelectric focusing agarose electrophoresis is essentially size independent and the dna and rna fragments by length biomolecules are separated by applying an electric field to move the charged molecules through an agarose matrix and the biomolecules are separated by size in the agarose gel matrix agarose gel is easy to cast has relatively fewer charged groups and is particularly suitable for separating dna of size range most often encountered in laboratories which accounts for the popularity of its use the separated dna may be viewed with stain most commonly under uv light and the dna fragments can be extracted from the gel with relative ease most agarose gels used are between dissolved in suitable electrophoresis buffer properties of agarose gel an agarose gel cast in tray to be used for gel electrophoresis agarose gel is three dimensional matrix formed of helical agarose molecules in supercoiled bundles that are aggregated into three dimensional structures with channels and pores through which biomolecules can pass the structure is held together with hydrogen bonds and can therefore be disrupted by heating back to liquid state the melting temperature is different from the gelling temperature depending on the sources agarose gel has gelling temperature of and melting temperature of low melting and low gelling agaroses made through chemical modifications are also available agarose gel has large pore size and good gel strength making it suitable as an anticonvection medium for the electrophoresis of dna and large protein molecules the pore size of gel has been estimated from nm to nm and its gel strength allows gels as dilute as to form slab for gel electrophoresis low concentration gels however are fragile and therefore hard to handle agarose gel has lower resolving power than polyacrylamide gel for dna but has greater range of separation and is therefore used for dna fragments of usually bp in size the limit of resolution for standard agarose gel electrophoresis is around kb but resolution of over mb is possible with pulsed field gel electrophoresis pfge it can also be used to separate large proteins and it is the preferred matrix for the gel electrophoresis of particles with effective radii larger than nm agarose gel has pores large enough for the entry of bacteriophage the agarose polymer contains charged groups in particular pyruvate and sulphate these negatively charged groups create flow of water in the opposite direction to the movement of dna in process called eeo and can therefore retard the movement of dna and cause blurring of bands higher concentration gels would have higher flow low eeo agarose is therefore generally preferred for use in agarose gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids but high eeo agarose may be used for other purposes the lower sulphate content of low eeo agarose particularly low melting point lmp agarose is also beneficial in cases where the dna extracted from gel is to be used for further manipulation as the presence of contaminating sulphates may affect some subsequent procedures such as ligation and pcr zero eeo agaroses however are undesirable for some applications as they may be made by adding positively charged groups and such groups can affect subsequent enzyme reactions is reason agarose is used in preference to agar as the agaropectin component in agar contains significant amount of negatively charged sulphate and carboxyl groups the removal of agaropectin in agarose substantially reduces the eeo as well as reducing the non specific adsorption of biomolecules to the gel matrix however for some applications such as the electrophoresis of serum proteins high eeo may be desirable and agaropectin may be added in the gel used migration of nucleic acids in agarose gel factors affecting migration of nucleic acid in gel gels of plasmid preparations usually show major band of supercoiled dna with other fainter bands in the same lane note that by convention dna gel is displayed with smaller dna fragments nearer to the bottom of the gel this is because historically dna gels were run vertically and the smaller dna fragments move downwards faster number of factors can affect the migration of nucleic acids the dimension of the gel pores gel concentration size of dna being electrophoresed the voltage used the ionic strength of the buffer and the concentration of intercalating dye such as ethidium bromide if used during electrophoresis smaller molecules travel faster than larger molecules in gel and double stranded dna moves at rate that is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the number of base pairs this relationship however breaks down with very large dna fragments and separation of very large dna fragments requires the use of pulsed field gel electrophoresis pfge which applies alternating current from two different directions and the large dna fragments are separated as they reorient themselves with the changing current for standard agarose gel electrophoresis larger molecules are resolved better using low concentration gel while smaller molecules separate better at high concentration gel high concentrations gel however requires longer run times sometimes days the movement of the dna may be affected by the conformation of the dna molecule for example supercoiled dna usually moves faster than relaxed dna because it is tightly coiled and hence more compact in normal plasmid dna preparation multiple forms of dna may be present gel electrophoresis of the plasmids would normally show the negatively supercoiled form as the main band while nicked dna open circular form and the relaxed closed circular form appears as minor bands the rate at which the various forms move however
