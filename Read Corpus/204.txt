an analog signal is any continuous signal for which the time varying feature of the signal is representation of some other time varying quantity analogous to another time varying signal for example in an analog audio signal the instantaneous voltage of the signal varies continuously with the pressure of the sound waves it differs from digital signal in which the continuous quantity is representation of sequence of discrete values which can only take on one of finite number of values the term analog signal usually refers to electrical signals however mechanical pneumatic hydraulic and other systems may also convey or be considered analog signals representation an analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal information for example an aneroid barometer uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information in an electrical signal the voltage current or frequency of the signal may be varied to represent the information any information may be conveyed by an analog signal such signal may be measured response to changes in physical variable such as sound light temperature position or pressure the physical variable is converted to an analog signal by transducer for example sound striking the diaphragm of microphone induces corresponding fluctuations in the current produced by coil in an electromagnetic microphone or the voltage produced by condenser microphone the voltage or the current is said to be an analog of the sound noise an analog signal is subject to electronic noise and distortion introduced by communication channels and signal processing operations which can progressively degrade the signal to noise ratio snr in contrast although converting an analog signal to digital form introduces low level quantization noise into the signal due to finite resolution of digital systems once in digital form the signal can be processed or transmitted without introducing significant additional noise or distortion in analog systems it is difficult to detect when such degradation occurs however in digital systems degradation can not only be detected but corrected as well the most serious disadvantage of analog signals compared to digital transmission is that analog transmissions always contain noise as the signal is copied transmitted or processed the unavoidable noise introduced in the signal path will accumulate as generation loss progressively and irreversibly degrading the signal to noise ratio until in extreme cases the signal can be overwhelmed noise can show up as hiss and intermodulation distortion in audio signals or snow in video signals generation loss is irreversible as there is no reliable method to distinguish the noise from the signal partly because amplifying the signal to recover attenuated parts of the signal amplifies the noise as well digital signals can be transmitted stored and processed without introducing noise in electrical analog signals noise can be minimized by shielding good connections and the use of certain cable types such as coaxial or twisted pair see also analog computer analog device analog recording analog signal processing analog video analog to digital converter digital signal electronics magnetic tape references
