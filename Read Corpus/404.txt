primary amine secondary amine tertiary amine primary amine secondary amine tertiary amine in organic chemistry amines are compounds and functional groups that contain basic nitrogen atom with lone pair amines are formally derivatives of ammonia wherein one or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced by substituent such as an alkyl or aryl group these may respectively be called alkylamines and arylamines amines in which both types of substituent are attached to one nitrogen atom may be called alkylarylamines important amines include amino acids biogenic amines trimethylamine and aniline see category amines for list of amines inorganic derivatives of ammonia are also called amines such as monochloramine nclh the substituent nh is called an amino group compounds with nitrogen atom attached to carbonyl group thus having the structure co nr are called amides and have different chemical properties from amines classification of amines amines can be classified according to the nature and number of substituents on nitrogen aliphatic amines contain only and alkyl substituents aromatic amines have the nitrogen atom connected to an aromatic ring amines alkyl and aryl alike are organized into three subcategories see table based on the number of carbon atoms adjacent to the nitrogen primary amines primary amines arise when one of three hydrogen atoms in ammonia is replaced by an alkyl or aromatic group important primary alkyl amines include methylamine most amino acids and the buffering agent tris while primary aromatic amines include aniline secondary amines secondary amines have two organic substituents alkyl aryl or both bound to the nitrogen together with one hydrogen important representatives include dimethylamine while an example of an aromatic amine would be diphenylamine tertiary amines in tertiary amines nitrogen has three organic substituents examples include trimethylamine which has distinctively fishy smell and edta fourth subcategory is determined by the connectivity of the substituents attached to the nitrogen cyclic amines cyclic amines are either secondary or tertiary amines examples of cyclic amines include the membered ring aziridine and the six membered ring piperidine and are examples of cyclic tertiary amines it is also possible to have four organic substituents on the nitrogen these species are not amines but are quaternary ammonium cations and have charged nitrogen center quaternary ammonium salts exist with many kinds of anions naming conventions amines are named in several ways typically the compound is given the prefix amino or the suffix amine the prefix shows substitution on the nitrogen atom an organic compound with multiple amino groups is called diamine triamine tetraamine and so forth systematic names for some common amines lower amines are named with the suffix amine px methylamine higher amines have the prefix amino as functional group iupac however does not recommend this convention but prefers the alkanamine form pentan amine px aminopentane or sometimes pent yl amine or pentan amine physical properties hydrogen bonding significantly influences the properties of primary and secondary amines for example methyl and ethyl amines are gases under standard conditions whereas the corresponding methyl and ethyl alcohols are liquids amines possess characteristic ammonia smell liquid amines have distinctive fishy smell the nitrogen atom features lone electron pair that can bind to form an ammonium ion nh the lone electron pair is represented in this article by two dots above or next to the the water solubility of simple amines is enhanced by hydrogen bonding involving these lone electron pairs typically salts of ammonium compounds exhibit the following order of solubility in water primary ammonium secondary ammonium tertiary ammonium nh small aliphatic amines display significant solubility in many solvents whereas those with large substituents are lipophilic aromatic amines such as aniline have their lone pair electrons conjugated into the benzene ring thus their tendency to engage in hydrogen bonding is diminished their boiling points are high and their solubility in water is low spectroscopic identification typically the presence of an amine functional group is deduced by combination of techniques including mass spectrometry as well as nmr and ir spectroscopies nmr signals for amines disappear upon treatment of the sample with in their infrared spectrum primary amines exhibit two bands whereas secondary amines exhibit only one structure alkyl amines alkyl amines feature tetrahedral nitrogen centers and angles approach the idealized angle of distances are slightly shorter than distances the energy barrier for the nitrogen inversion of the stereocenter is about kcal mol for trialkylamine the interconversion has been compared to the inversion of an open umbrella into strong wind amines of the type nhrr and nrr are chiral the nitrogen center bears four substituents counting the lone pair because of the low barrier to inversion amines of the type nhrr cannot be obtained in optical purity for chiral tertiary amines nrr can only be resolved when the and groups are constrained in cyclic structures such as substituted aziridines quaternary ammonium salts are resolvable px px inversion of an amine the pair of dots represents the lone electron pair on the nitrogen atom aromatic amines in aromatic amines anilines nitrogen is often nearly planar owing to conjugation of the lone pair with the aryl substituent the distance is correspondingly shorter in aniline the distance is the same as the distances basicity like ammonia amines are bases compared to alkali metal hydroxides amines are weaker see table for examples of conjugate acid

nitroaniline no nh cf nh the basicity of amines depends on the electronic properties of the substituents alkyl groups enhance the basicity aryl groups diminish it the degree of solvation of the protonated amine which includes steric hindrance by the groups on nitrogen electronic effects owing to inductive effects the basicity of an amine might be expected to increase with the number of alkyl groups on the amine correlations are complicated owing to the effects of solvation which are opposite the trends for inductive effects solvation effects also dominate the basicity of aromatic amines anilines
