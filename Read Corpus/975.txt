minute of arc arcminute arcmin arc minute or minute arc denoted by the symbol is unit of angular measurement equal to of one degree since one degree is of turn or complete rotation one minute of arc is of turn the nautical mile was originally defined as minute of latitude on hypothetical spherical earth so the actual earth circumference is very near nautical miles minute of arc is of radian second of arc arcsecond arcsec or arc second denoted by the symbol is of an arcminute of degree of turn and about of radian these units originated in babylonian astronomy as sexagesimal subdivisions of the degree they are used in fields that involve very small angles such as astronomy optometry ophthalmology optics navigation land surveying and marksmanship to express even smaller angles standard si prefixes can be employed the milliarcsecond mas and microarcsecond μas for instance are commonly used in astronomy the number of square arcminutes in complete sphere is square arcminutes the surface area of unit sphere in square units divided by the solid angle area subtended by square arcminute also in square units so that the final result is dimensionless number the fact that the terms minute and second also denote units of time derives from babylonian astronomy where the corresponding time related terms denoted the duration of the sun apparent motion of one minute or one second of arc respectively through the ecliptic in present terms the babylonian degree of time was four minutes long so the minute of time was four seconds long and the second of second symbols and abbreviations the prime symbol designates the arcminute though single quote is commonly used where only ascii characters are permitted one arcminute is thus written as it is also abbreviated as arcmin or amin or less commonly the prime with circumflex over it similarly double prime designates the arcsecond though double quote is commonly used where only ascii characters are permitted one arcsecond is thus written as it is also abbreviated as arcsec or asec sexagesimal system of angular measurement unit value symbol abbreviations in radians approx degree turn degree deg arcminute degree prime arcmin amin am moa arcsecond arcminute degree double prime arcsec asec as milliarcsecond arcsecond degree mas microarcsecond mas arcsecond μas in celestial navigation seconds of arc are rarely used in calculations the preference usually being for degrees minutes and decimals of minute for example written as or this notation has been carried over into marine gps receivers which normally display latitude and longitude in the latter format by default common examples the full moon average apparent size is about arcminutes or an arcminute is approximately the resolution of the human eye an arcsecond is approximately the angle subtended by dime coin mm at distance of an arcsecond is also the angle subtended by an object of diameter at distance of one astronomical unit an object of diameter at one light year an object of diameter one astronomical unit at distance of one parsec per the definition of the latter milliarcsecond is about the size of dime atop the eiffel tower as seen from new york city microarcsecond is about the size of period at the end of sentence in the apollo mission manuals left on the moon as seen from earth nanoarcsecond is about the size of penny on neptune moon triton as observed from earth also notable examples of size in arcseconds are hubble space telescope has calculational resolution of arcseconds and actual resolution of almost arcseconds which is close to the diffraction limit crescent venus measures between and seconds of arc uses astronomy comparison of angular diameter of the sun moon planets and the international space station true represen tation of the sizes is achieved when the image is viewed at distance of times the width of the moon max circle for example if the moon max circle is cm wide on computer display viewing it from away will show true representation of the sizes since antiquity the arcminute and arcsecond have been used in astronomy in the ecliptic coordinate system as latitude and longitude in the horizon system as altitude alt and azimuth az and in the equatorial coordinate system as declination all are measured in degrees arcminutes and arcseconds the principal exception is right ascension ra in equatorial coordinates which is measured in time units of hours minutes and seconds the arcsecond is also often used to describe small astronomical angles such as the angular diameters of planets the angular diameter of venus which varies between and the proper motion of stars the separation of components of binary star systems and parallax the small change of position of star in the course of year or of solar system body as the earth rotates these small angles may also be written in milliarcseconds mas or thousandths of an arcsecond the unit of distance the parsec named from the par allax of one arc sec ond was developed for such parallax measurements it is the distance at which the mean radius of the earth orbit more precisely one astronomical unit would subtend an angle of one arcsecond the esa astrometric satellite gaia launched in can approximate star positions to microarcseconds µas milky way central region with an angular resolution of apart from the sun the star with the largest angular diameter from earth is doradus red giant with diameter of because of the effects of atmospheric blurring ground based telescopes will smear the image of star to an angular diameter of about in poor conditions this increases to or even more the dwarf planet pluto has proven difficult to resolve because its angular diameter is about space telescopes are not affected by the earth atmosphere but are diffraction limited for example the hubble space telescope can reach an angular size of stars down to about techniques exist for improving seeing on the ground adaptive optics for example can produce images around on class telescope cartography minutes and seconds of arc are
