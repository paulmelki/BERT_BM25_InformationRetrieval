the achaeans akhaioí the achaeans or of achaea constitute one of the collective names for the mycenean greeks in homer iliad used times and odyssey the other common names are danaans danaoi used times in the iliad and argives used times in the iliad the terms panhellenes all of the greeks and hellenes both appear only once and they are used to denote common greek civilizational identity in the future the achaeans were used to describe the inhabitants of the region of achaea region in the north west part of the peloponnese the city states of this region later formed confederation known as the achaean league which was influential during the rd and nd centuries bc and expanded all over the pelloponese homeric versus later use the homeric long haired achaeans would have been part of the mycenaean civilization that dominated the southern parts of greece from circa bc until bc later by the archaic and classical periods the term achaeans referred to inhabitants of the much smaller region of achaea herodotus identified the achaeans of the northern peloponnese as descendants of the earlier homeric achaeans according to pausanias writing in the nd century ce the term achaean was originally given to those greeks inhabiting the argolis and laconia pausanias and herodotus both recount the legend that the achaeans were forced from their homelands by the dorians during the legendary dorian invasion of the peloponnese they then moved into the region later called achaea scholarly consensus has not yet been reached on the origin of the historic achaeans relative to the homeric achaeans and is still hotly debated former emphasis on presumed race such as john scott article about the blond locks of the achaeans as compared to the dark locks of mediterranean poseidon on the basis of hints in homer has been rejected by some the contrasting belief that achaeans as understood through homer is name without state an ethnos created in the epic tradition has modern supporters among those who conclude that achaeans were redefined in the th century bc as contemporary speakers of aeolic greek karl beloch suggested there was no dorian invasion but rather that the peloponnesian dorians were the achaeans eduard meyer disagreeing with beloch instead put forth the suggestion that the real life achaeans were mainland pre dorian greeks his conclusion is based on his research on the similarity between the languages of the achaeans and pre historic arcadians william prentice disagreed with both noting archeological evidence suggests the achaeans instead migrated from southern asia minor to greece probably settling first in lower thessaly probably prior to bc hittite documents emil forrer swiss hittitologist who worked on the boghazköy tablets in berlin said the achaeans of pre homeric greece were directly associated with the term land of ahhiyawa mentioned in the hittite texts his conclusions at the time were challenged by other hittitologists johannes friedrich in and albrecht götze in as well as by ferdinand sommer who published his die ahhijava urkunden the ahhiyawa documents in map showing the hittite empire ahhiyawa achaeans and wilusa troy in bc some hittite texts mention nation lying to the west called ahhiyawa in the earliest reference to this land letter outlining the treaty violations of the hittite vassal madduwatta it is called ahhiya another important example is the tawagalawa letter written by an unnamed hittite king most probably hattusili iii of the empire period th th century bc to the king of ahhiyawa treating him as an equal and implying miletus millawanda was under his control it also refers to an earlier wilusa episode involving hostility on the part of ahhiyawa ahhiya wa has been identified with the achaeans of the trojan war and the city of wilusa with the legendary city of troy note the similarity with early greek wilion later ilion the name of the acropolis of troy the exact relationship of the term ahhiyawa to the achaeans beyond similarity in pronunciation was hotly debated by scholars even following the discovery that mycenaean linear is an early form of greek the earlier debate was summed up in by hans güterbock of the oriental institute more recent research based on new readings and interpretations of the hittite texts as well as of the material evidence for mycenaean contacts with the anatolian mainland came to the conclusion that ahhiyawa referred to the mycenaean world or at least to part of it egyptian sources map of mycenaean cultural areas bc unearthed sites in red dots it has been proposed that ekwesh of the egyptian records may relate to achaea compared to hittite ahhiyawa whereas denyen and tanaju may relate to classical greek danaoi the earliest textual reference to the mycenaean world is in the annals of thutmosis iii ca bc which refers to messengers from the king of the tanaju circa bc offering greeting gifts to the egyptian king in order to initiate diplomatic relations when the latter campaigned in syria tanaju is also listed in an inscription at the mortuary temple of amenhotep iii the latter ruled egypt in circa bc moreover list of the cities and regions of the tanaju is also mentioned in this inscription among the cities listed are mycenae nauplion kythera messenia and the thebaid region of thebes during the th year of pharaoh merneptah confederation of libyan and northern peoples is supposed to have attacked the western delta included amongst the ethnic names of the repulsed invaders is the ekwesh or eqwesh whom some have seen as achaeans although egyptian texts specifically mention these ekwesh to be circumcised which does not seem to have been general practice in the aegean at the time homer mentions an achaean attack upon the delta and menelaus speaks of the same in book iv of the odyssey to telemachus when he recounts his own return home from the trojan war later greek myths also say helen had spent the time of the trojan war in egypt and not at troy and that after troy the achaeans
