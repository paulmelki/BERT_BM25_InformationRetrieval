the constellation argo navis drawn by johannes hevelius argo navis the ship argo or simply argo was large constellation in the southern sky the genitive was argus navis abbreviated arg flamsteed and other early modern astronomers called it navis the ship genitive navis abbreviated nav the constellation proved to be of unwieldy size as it was larger than the next largest constellation and had more than easily visible stars the catalogue of nicolas louis de lacaille divided it into the three modern constellations that occupy much of the same area carina the hull puppis the poop deck and vela the sails argo derived from the ship argo in greek mythology sailed by jason and the argonauts to colchis in search of the golden fleece some stars of puppis and vela can be seen from mediterranean latitudes in winter and spring the ship appearing to skim along the river of the milky way due to precession of the equinoxes the position of the stars from earth viewpoint has shifted southward and though most of the constellation was visible in classical times the constellation is now not easily visible from most of the northern hemisphere all the stars of argo navis are easily visible from the tropics southward and pass near zenith from southern temperate latitudes the brightest of these is canopus carinae the second brightest night time star now assigned to carina history development of the greek constellation argo navis was long known to greek observers who are theorised to have derived it from egypt around bce plutarch attributed it to the egyptian boat of osiris some academics theorized sumerian origin related to the epic of gilgamesh hypothesis rejected for lack of evidence that the sumerians or other mesopotamian culture considered these stars or any portion of them to form boat manuchihr globe made in mashhad ce adilnor collection sweden over time argo became identified exclusively with ancient greek myth of jason and the argonauts in his almagest claudius ptolemy described argo navis as occupying the portion of the milky way between canis major and centaurus and identified stars comprising such details as the little shield the steering oar the mast holder and the stern ornament which continued to be reflected in cartographic representations in celestial atlases into the nineteenth century see below the ship appeared to rotate about the pole sternwards so nautically in reverse aratus the greek poet historian living in the third century bce noted this backward progression writing argo by the great dog canis major tail is drawn for hers is not usual course but backward turned she comes the constituent modern constellations in modern times argo navis was considered unwieldy due to its enormous size larger than hydra the largest modern constellation in his star atlas nicolas louis de lacaille explained that there were more than hundred and sixty stars clearly visible to the naked eye in navis and so he used the set of lowercase and uppercase latin letters three times on portions of the constellation referred to as argûs in carina carina the keel or hull argûs in puppi puppis the poop deck or stern and argûs in velis vela the sails lacaille replaced bayer designations with new ones that followed stellar magnitudes more closely but used only single greek letter sequence and described the constellation for those stars as argûs similarly faint unlettered stars were listed only as in argûs the final breakup and abolition of argo navis was proposed by sir john herschel in and again in despite this the constellation remained in use in parallel with its constituent parts into the th century in along with the other constellations it received three letter abbreviation arg the breakup and relegation to former constellation occurred in when the iau defined the modern constellations formally instituting carina puppis and vela and declaring argo obsolete lacaille designations were kept in the offspring so carina has and vela has and puppis has and so on as result of this breakup argo navis is the only one of the listed by ptolemy in his almagest no longer officially recognized as single constellation in addition the constellation pyxis the mariner compass occupies an area near that which in antiquity was considered part of argo mast some recent authors state that modern pyxis was part of the ancient greek conception of argo navis but magnetic compasses were unknown in ancient greek times nor does it appear that the stars now in pyxis were included in the original conception of argo navis lacaille considered it separate constellation representing modern scientific instrument like microscopium and telescopium that he created for maps of the stars of the southern hemisphere pyxis was listed among his new constellations separate from argo in john herschel suggested formalizing the mast as new constellation malus to replace lacaille pyxis but the idea did not catch on similarly an effort by edmond halley to detach the cloud of mist at the prow of argo navis to form new constellation named robur carolinum charles oak in honor of king charles ii his patron was unsuccessful representations in other cultures in vedic astronomy indian observers also saw the asterism as the boat the māori had several names for what was the constellation including te waka tamarereti the canoe of tamarereti te kohi autahi an expression meaning cold of autumn settling down on land and water and te kohi see also asterism astronomy list of stars in argo navis footnotes references
