radar and other avionics in the nose of cessna citation sp thunderchief with avionics laid out avionics are the electronic systems used on aircraft artificial satellites and spacecraft avionic systems include communications navigation the display and management of multiple systems and the hundreds of systems that are fitted to aircraft to perform individual functions these can be as simple as searchlight for police helicopter or as complicated as the tactical system for an airborne early warning platform the term avionics is portmanteau of the words aviation and electronics history the term avionics was coined in by philip klass senior editor at aviation week space technology magazine as portmanteau of aviation electronics radio communication was first used in aircraft just prior to world war the first airborne radios were in zeppelins but the military sparked development of light radio sets that could be carried by heavier than air craft so that aerial reconnaissance biplanes could report their observations immediately in case they were shot down the first experimental radio transmission from an airplane was conducted by the us navy august the first aircraft radios transmitted by radiotelegraphy so they required two seat aircraft with second crewman to tap on telegraph key to spell out messages by morse code during world war am voice two way radio sets were made possible in by the development of the triode vacuum tube which were simple enough that the pilot in single seat aircraft could use it while flying radar the central technology used today in aircraft navigation and air traffic control was developed by several nations mainly in secret as an air defense system in the during the runup to world war ii many modern avionics have their origins in world war ii wartime developments for example autopilot systems that are commonplace today began as specialized systems to help bomber planes fly steadily enough to hit precision targets from high altitudes britain decision to share its radar technology with its us ally particularly the magnetron vacuum tube in the famous tizard mission significantly shortened the war modern avionics is substantial portion of military aircraft spending aircraft like the and the now retired have roughly percent of their budget spent on avionics most modern helicopters now have budget splits of in favour of avionics the civilian market has also seen growth in cost of avionics flight control systems fly by wire and new navigation needs brought on by tighter airspaces have pushed up development costs the major change has been the recent boom in consumer flying as more people begin to use planes as their primary method of transportation more elaborate methods of controlling aircraft safely in these high restrictive airspaces have been invented modern avionics avionics plays heavy role in modernization initiatives like the federal aviation administration faa next generation air transportation system project in the united states and the single european sky atm research sesar initiative in europe the joint planning and development office put forth roadmap for avionics in six areas published routes and procedures improved navigation and routing negotiated trajectories adding data communications to create preferred routes dynamically delegated separation enhanced situational awareness in the air and on the ground lowvisibility ceilingapproach departure allowing operations with weather constraints with less ground infrastructure surface operations to increase safety in approach and departure atm efficiencies improving the atm process market the aircraft electronics association reports billion avionics sales for the first three quarters of in business and general aviation yearly improvement came from north america forward fit represented while were retrofits as the deadline of january for mandatory ads out approach aircraft avionics the cockpit of an aircraft is typical location for avionic equipment including control monitoring communication navigation weather and anti collision systems the majority of aircraft power their avionics using or volt dc electrical systems however larger more sophisticated aircraft such as airliners or military combat aircraft have ac systems operating at hz volts ac there are several major vendors of flight avionics including panasonic avionics corporation honeywell which now owns bendix king universal avionics systems corporation rockwell collins now collins aerospace thales group ge aviation systems garmin raytheon parker hannifin utc aerospace systems now collins aerospace selex es now leonardo shadin avionics and avidyne corporation international standards for avionics equipment are prepared by the airlines electronic engineering committee aeec and published by arinc communications communications connect the flight deck to the ground and the flight deck to the passengers on board communications are provided by public address systems and aircraft intercoms the vhf aviation communication system works on the airband of mhz to mhz each channel is spaced from the adjacent ones by khz in europe khz elsewhere vhf is also used for line of sight communication such as aircraft to aircraft and aircraft to atc amplitude modulation am is used and the conversation is performed in simplex mode aircraft communication can also take place using hf especially for trans oceanic flights or satellite communication navigation air navigation is the determination of position and direction on or above the surface of the earth avionics can use satellite navigation systems such as gps and waas ins inertial navigation system ground based radio navigation systems such as vor or loran or any combination thereof some navigation systems such as gps calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on moving map displays older ground based navigation systems such as vor or loran requires pilot or navigator to plot the intersection of signals on paper map to determine an aircraft location modern systems calculate the position automatically and display it to the flight crew on moving map displays monitoring the airbus glass cockpit featuring pull out keyboards and two wide computer screens on the sides for pilots the first hints of glass cockpits emerged in the when flight worthy cathode ray tube crt screens began to replace displays gauges and instruments glass cockpit refers to the use of computer monitors instead of gauges and other analog displays aircraft were
