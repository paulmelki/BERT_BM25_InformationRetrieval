the accelerated graphics port agp was designed as high speed point to point channel for attaching video card to computer system primarily to assist in the acceleration of computer graphics it was originally designed as successor to pci type connections for video cards since agp has been progressively phased out in favor of pci express pcie by mid pci express cards dominated the market and only few agp models were available with gpu manufacturers and add in board partners eventually dropping support for the interface in favor of pci express advantages over pci as computers increasingly became graphically oriented successive generations of graphics adapters began to push the limits of pci bus with shared bandwidth this led to the development of agp bus dedicated to graphics adapters agp is heavily based on pci and in fact the agp bus is superset of the conventional pci bus and agp cards must act as pci cards the primary advantage of agp over pci is that it provides dedicated pathway between the slot and the processor rather than sharing the pci bus in addition to lack of contention for the bus the direct connection allows for higher clock speeds the second major change is that agp uses split transactions where the address and data phases of pci transaction are separated the card may send many address phases and the host processes them in order this avoids long delays with the bus idle during read operations third pci bus handshaking is simplified unlike pci bus transactions whose length is negotiated on cycle by cycle basis using the frame and stop signals agp transfers are always multiple of bytes long and the total length is included in the request further rather than using the irdy and trdy signals for each word data is transferred in blocks of four clock cycles words at agp speed and pauses are allowed only between blocks finally agp allows optional in agp and mandatory in agp sideband addressing meaning that the address and data buses are separated so the address phase does not use the main address data ad lines at all this is done by adding an extra bit sideband address bus over which the graphics controller can issue new agp requests while other agp data is flowing over the main address data ad lines this results in improved overall agp data throughput this great improvement in memory read performance makes it practical for an agp card to read textures directly from system ram while pci graphics card must copy it from system ram to the card video memory system memory is made available using the graphics address remapping table gart which apportions main memory as needed for texture storage the maximum amount of system memory available to agp is defined as the agp aperture history an agp card the agp slot first appeared on compatible system boards based on socket intel pentium and slot pentium ii processors intel introduced agp support with the lx slot chipset on august and flood of products followed from all the major system board vendors the first socket chipsets to support agp were the via apollo vp sis and the ali aladdin intel never released an agp equipped socket chipset fic demonstrated the first socket agp system board in november as the fic pa based on the via apollo vp chipset followed very quickly by the epox vp also based on the via vp chipset which was first to market early video chipsets featuring agp support included the rendition vérité dfx voodoo banshee nvidia riva dlabs permedia intel ati rage series matrox millennium ii and virge gx some early agp boards used graphics processors built around pci and were simply bridged to agp this resulted in the cards benefiting little from the new bus with the only improvement used being the mhz bus clock with its resulting doubled bandwidth over pci and bus exclusivity examples of such cards were the voodoo banshee vérité millennium ii and virge gx intel was explicitly designed to exploit the new agp feature set in fact it was designed to texture only from agp memory making pci versions of the board difficult to implement local board ram had to emulate agp memory microsoft first introduced agp support into windows oem service release osr version or via the usb supplement to osr patch after applying the patch the windows system became windows version the first windows nt based operating system to receive agp support was windows nt with service pack introduced in linux support for agp enhanced fast data transfers was first added in with the implementation of the agpgart kernel module versions agp and pci bit buses operating at

garthi there are various physical interfaces connectors see the compatibility section official extensions apple macintosh agp pro graphics card agp pro an official extension for cards that required more electrical power with longer slot with additional pins for that purpose agp pro cards were usually workstation class cards used to accelerate professional computer aided design applications employed in the fields of architecture machining engineering simulations and similar fields bit agp bit channel was once proposed as an optional standard for agp in draft documents but it was dropped in the final version of the standard the standard allows
