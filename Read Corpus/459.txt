illustration from the morgan bible of abner in green taking michal away from paltiel in the hebrew bible abner avner was the cousin of king saul and the commander in chief of his army his name also appears as abiner son of ner where the longer form abiner means my father is ner biblical narrative abner is initially mentioned incidentally in saul history first appearing as the son of ner saul uncle and the commander of saul army he then comes to the story again as the commander who introduced david to saul following david killing of goliath he is not mentioned in the account of the disastrous battle of gilboa when saul power was crushed seizing the youngest but only surviving of saul sons ish bosheth also called eshbaal abner set him up as king over israel at mahanaim east of the jordan david who was accepted as king by judah alone was meanwhile reigning at hebron and for some time war was carried on between the two parties the only engagement between the rival factions which is told at length is noteworthy inasmuch as it was preceded by an encounter at gibeon between twelve chosen men from each side in which the whole twenty four seem to have perished in the general engagement which followed abner was defeated and put to flight he was closely pursued by asahel brother of joab who is said to have been light of foot as wild roe as asahel would not desist from the pursuit though warned abner was compelled to slay him in self defence this originated deadly feud between the leaders of the opposite parties for joab as next of kin to asahel was by the law and custom of the country the avenger of his blood however according to josephus in antiquities book chapter joab had forgiven abner for the death of his brother asahel the reason being that abner had slain asahel honorably in combat after he had first warned asahel and had no other choice but to kill him out of self defense this battle was part of civil war between david and ish bosheth the son of saul after this battle abner switched to the side of david and granted him control over the tribe of benjamin this act put abner in david favor for some time afterward the war was carried on the advantage being invariably on the side of david at length ish bosheth lost the main prop of his tottering cause by accusing abner of sleeping with rizpah cf one of saul concubines an alliance which according to contemporary notions would imply pretensions to the throne cf ff abner was indignant at the rebuke and immediately opened negotiations with david who welcomed him on the condition that his wife michal should be restored to him this was done and the proceedings were ratified by feast almost immediately after however joab who had been sent away perhaps intentionally returned and slew abner at the gate of hebron the ostensible motive for the assassination was desire to avenge asahel and this would be sufficient justification for the deed according to the moral standard of the time although abner should have been safe from such revenge killing in hebron which was city of refuge the conduct of david after the event was such as to show that he had no complicity in the act though he could not venture to punish its perpetrators cf ff david and the tomb of abner artist unknown th century david had abner buried in hebron as it states in and david said to all the people who were with him rend your clothes and gird yourselves with sackcloth and wail before abner and king david went after the bier and they buried abner in hebron and the king raised his voice and wept on abner grave and all the people wept shortly after abner death ish bosheth was assassinated as he slept and david became king of the reunited kingdoms tomb of abner the site known as the tomb of abner is
