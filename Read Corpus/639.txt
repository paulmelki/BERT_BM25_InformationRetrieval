interactive animation of the structure of atp adenosine triphosphate atp is an organic compound and hydrotrope that provides energy to drive many processes in living cells muscle contraction nerve impulse propagation condensate dissolution and chemical synthesis found in all known forms of life atp is often referred to as the molecular unit of currency of intracellular energy transfer when consumed in metabolic processes it converts either to adenosine diphosphate adp or to adenosine monophosphate amp other processes regenerate atp so that the human body recycles its own body weight equivalent in atp each day it is also precursor to dna and rna and is used as coenzyme from the perspective of biochemistry atp is classified as nucleoside triphosphate which indicates that it consists of three components nitrogenous base adenine the sugar ribose and the triphosphate structure atp consists of an adenine attached by the nitrogen atom to the carbon atom of sugar ribose which in turn is attached at the carbon atom of the sugar to triphosphate group in its many reactions related to metabolism the adenine and sugar groups remain unchanged but the triphosphate is converted to di and monophosphate giving respectively the derivatives adp and amp the three phosphoryl groups are referred to as the alpha beta and for the terminal phosphate gamma in neutral solution ionized atp exists mostly as atp with small proportion of atp binding of metal cations to atp being polyanionic and featuring potentially chelatable polyphosphate group atp binds metal cations with high affinity the binding constant for is the binding of divalent cation almost always magnesium strongly affects the interaction of atp with various proteins due to the strength of the atp mg interaction atp exists in the cell mostly as complex with bonded to the phosphate oxygen centers second magnesium ion is critical for atp binding in the kinase domain the presence of mg regulates kinase activity chemical properties salts of atp can be isolated as colorless solids the cycles of synthesis and degradation of atp and represent input and output of energy respectively atp is stable in aqueous solutions between ph and in the absence of catalysts at more extreme phs it rapidly hydrolyses to adp and phosphate living cells maintain the ratio of atp to adp at point ten orders of magnitude from equilibrium with atp concentrations fivefold higher than the concentration of adp in the context of biochemical reactions the bonds are frequently referred to as high energy bonds the hydrolysis of atp into adp and inorganic phosphate releases kj mol of enthalpy with change in free energy of kj mol the energy released by cleaving either phosphate pi or pyrophosphate ppi unit from atp at standard

of single gas phase magnesium atp chelate with charge of the anion was optimized at the ub lyp theoretical level and the atomic connectivity modified by the human optimizer to reflect the probable electronic structure production from amp and adp production aerobic conditions typical intracellular concentration of atp is hard to pin down however reports have shown there to be Î¼mol per gram of tissue in variety of eukaryotes the of atp and of adp and amp occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism atp can be produced by number of distinct cellular processes the three main pathways in eukaryotes are glycolysis the citric acid cycle oxidative phosphorylation and beta oxidation the overall process of oxidizing glucose to carbon dioxide the combination of pathways and known as cellular respiration produces about equivalents of atp from each molecule of glucose atp production by non photosynthetic aerobic eukaryote occurs mainly in the mitochondria which comprise nearly of the volume of typical cell glycolysis in glycolysis glucose and glycerol are metabolized to pyruvate glycolysis generates two equivalents of atp through substrate phosphorylation catalyzed by two enzymes pgk and pyruvate kinase two equivalents of nadh are also produced which can be oxidized via the electron transport chain and result in the generation of additional atp by atp synthase the pyruvate generated as an end product of glycolysis is substrate for the krebs cycle glycolysis is viewed as consisting of two phases with five steps each in phase the preparatory phase glucose is converted to glyceraldehyde phosphate one atp is invested in step and another atp is invested in step steps and of glycolysis are referred to as priming steps in phase two equivalents of are converted to two pyruvates in step two atp are produced also in step two further equivalents of atp are produced in steps and atp is generated from adp net of two atps is formed in the glycolysis cycle the glycolysis pathway is later associated with the citric acid cycle which produces additional equivalents of atp regulation in glycolysis hexokinase is directly inhibited by its product glucose phosphate and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by atp itself the main control point for the glycolytic pathway is pfk which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of atp and activated by high concentrations of amp the inhibition of pfk by atp is unusual since atp is also substrate in the reaction catalyzed by pfk the active form of the enzyme is tetramer that exists in two conformations only one of which binds the second substrate fructose phosphate the protein has two binding sites for atp the active site is accessible in either protein conformation but atp binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds poorly number of other small molecules can compensate for the atp induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate pfk including cyclic amp ammonium ions inorganic phosphate and fructose and biphosphate citric acid cycle in the mitochondrion pyruvate is oxidized by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to the acetyl group which is fully oxidized to carbon dioxide by the
