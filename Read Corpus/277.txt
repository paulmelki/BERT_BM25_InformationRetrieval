but are typically larger than an accordion and sit on surface or the floor the accordion is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or keys causing pallets to open which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel called reeds these vibrate to produce sound inside the body valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block the performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right hand manual and the accompaniment consisting of bass and pre set chord buttons on the left hand manual the accordion is widely spread across the world because of the waves of immigration from europe to the americas and other regions in some countries for example brazil colombia

automatically coupled chords on the bass side construction diatonic button accordion being played accordions have many configurations and types what may be easy to do with one type of accordion could be technically challenging or impossible with another and proficiency with one layout may not translate to another the most obvious difference between accordions is their right hand manuals piano accordions use piano style musical keyboard while button accordions use buttonboard button accordions are furthermore differentiated by their usage of chromatic or diatonic buttonboard for the right hand manual accordions may be either bisonoric producing different pitches depending on the direction of bellows movement or unisonoric producing the same pitch in both directions piano accordions are unisonoric chromatic button accordions also tend to be unisonoric while diatonic button accordions tend to be bisonoric though notable exceptions exist accordion size is not standardized and may vary significantly from model to model accordions vary not only in their dimensions and weight but also in number of buttons or keys present in the right and left hand manuals for example piano accordions may have as few as bass buttons or up to and even beyond this in rare cases accordions also vary by their available registers and by their specific tuning and voicing despite these differences all

accordions roland corporation bandoneon english concertina anglo german concertinas anglo concertinas the bellows is the most recognizable part of the instrument and the primary means of articulation the production of sound in an accordion is in direct proportion to the motion of the bellows by the player in sense the role of the bellows can be compared to the role of moving violin bow on bowed strings for more direct analogy the bellows can be compared to the role of breathing for singer the bellows is located between the right and left hand manuals and is made from pleated layers of cloth and cardboard with added leather and metal it is used to create pressure and vacuum driving air across the internal reeds and producing sound by their vibrations applied pressure increases the volume the keyboard touch is not expressive and does not affect dynamics all expression is effected through the bellows bellows effects include volume control including swells and fades repeated short rapid changes of direction bellows shake which has been popularized by musicians such as renato borghete gaucho music and luiz gonzaga and extensively used in forr칩 called resfulengo in brazil constant bellows motion while applying pressure at intervals constant bellows motion to produce clear tones with no resonance subtly changing the intonation to mimic the expressiveness of singer using the bellows with the silent air button gives the sound of air moving whooshing which is sometimes used in contemporary compositions for this instrument body petosa accordion shop showroom the accordion body consists of two wooden boxes joined together by the bellows these boxes house reed chambers for the right and left hand manuals each side has grilles in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument and to allow the sound to project better the grille for the right hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes the right hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left hand manual for playing the accompaniment however skilled players can reverse these roles and play melodies with the left hand the size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type layout and playing range which can be as small as to have only one or two rows of basses and single octave on the right hand manual to the standard bass accordion and through to large and heavy
