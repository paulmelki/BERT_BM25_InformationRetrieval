antibiotic resistance tests bacteria are streaked on dishes with white disks each impregnated with different antibiotic clear rings such as those on the left show that bacteria have not grown indicating that these bacteria are not resistant the bacteria on the right are fully resistant to all but two of the seven antibiotics tested alt two petri dishes with antibiotic resistance tests antimicrobial resistance amr or ar occurs when microbes evolve mechanisms that protect them from the effects of antimicrobials the term antibiotic resistance ar or abr is subset of amr as it applies to bacteria that become resistant to antibiotics resistant microbes are more difficult to treat requiring higher doses or alternative medications which may prove more toxic these approaches may also be more expensive microbes resistant to multiple antimicrobials are called multidrug resistant mdr all classes of microbes can evolve resistance fungi evolve antifungal resistance viruses evolve antiviral resistance protozoa evolve antiprotozoal resistance and bacteria evolve antibiotic resistance those bacteria that are considered extensively drug resistant xdr or totally drug resistant tdr are sometimes called superbugs resistance in bacteria can arise naturally by genetic mutation or by one species acquiring resistance from another resistance can appear spontaneously because of random mutations however extended use of antimicrobials appears to encourage selection for mutations which can render antimicrobials ineffective the prevention of antibiotic misuse which can lead to antibiotic resistance includes prescribing or using antibiotics only when they are needed narrow spectrum antibiotics are preferred over broad spectrum antibiotics when possible as effectively and accurately targeting specific organisms is less likely to cause resistance as well as side effects for people who take these medications at home education about proper use is essential health care providers can minimize spread of resistant infections by use of proper sanitation and hygiene including handwashing and disinfecting between patients and should encourage the same of the patient visitors and family members rising drug resistance is caused mainly by use of antimicrobials in humans and other animals and spread of resistant strains between the two growing resistance has also been linked to dumping of inadequately treated effluents from the pharmaceutical industry especially in countries where bulk drugs are manufactured antibiotics increase selective pressure in bacterial populations causing vulnerable bacteria to die this increases the percentage of resistant bacteria which continue growing even at very low levels of antibiotic resistant bacteria can have growth advantage and grow faster than vulnerable bacteria with resistance to antibiotics becoming more common there is greater need for alternative treatments calls for new antibiotic therapies have been issued but new drug development is becoming rarer antimicrobial resistance is increasing globally because of greater access to antibiotic drugs in developing countries estimates are that to several million deaths result per year and continues to pose major public health threat worldwide each year in the united states at least million people become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics and at least people die as result according to world health organization who estimates three hundred and fifty million deaths could be caused by amr by there are public calls for global collective action to address the threat that include proposals for international treaties on antimicrobial resistance worldwide antibiotic resistance is not completely identified but poorer countries with weaker healthcare systems are more affected definition alt diagram showing difference between non resistance bacteria and drug resistant bacteria the who defines antimicrobial resistance as microorganism resistance to an antimicrobial drug that was once able to treat an infection by that microorganism person cannot become resistant to antibiotics resistance is property of the microbe not person or other organism infected by microbe antibiotic resistance is subset of antimicrobial resistance this more specified resistance is linked to pathogenic bacteria and thus broken down into two further subsets microbiological and clinical resistance linked is the most common and occurs from genes mutated or inherited that allow the bacteria to resist the mechanism associated with certain antibiotics clinical resistance is shown through the failure of many therapeutic techniques where the bacteria that are normally susceptible to treatment become resistant after surviving the outcome of the treatment in both cases of acquired resistance the bacteria can pass the genetic catalyst for resistance through conjugation transduction or transformation this allows the resistance to spread across the same pathogen or even similar bacterial pathogens overview who report released april stated this serious threat is no longer prediction for the future it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone of any age in any country antibiotic resistance when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections is now major threat to public health in who considered antibiotic resistance to be one of the biggest threats to global health food security and development the european centre for disease prevention and control calculated that in there were infections in the eu and european economic area caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria resulting in deaths most were acquired in healthcare settings causes antimicrobial resistance is mainly caused by the overuse of antimicrobials this leads to microbes either evolving defense against drugs used to treat them or certain strains of microbes that have natural resistance to antimicrobials becoming much more prevalent than the ones that are easily defeated with medication while antimicrobial resistance does occur naturally over time the use of antimicrobial agents in variety of settings both within the healthcare industry and outside of has led to antimicrobial resistance becoming increasingly more prevalent natural occurrence cdc infographic on how antibiotic resistance major type of antimicrobial resistance happens and spreads antimicrobial resistance can evolve naturally due to continued exposure to antimicrobials natural selection means that organisms that are able to adapt to their environment survive and continue to produce offspring as result the types of microorganisms that are able to survive over time with continued attack by certain antimicrobial agents will naturally become more prevalent in the environment and those
