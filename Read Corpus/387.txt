wooden cup shaped mouthpiece it is used by mountain dwellers in the swiss alps austrian alps bavarian alps in germany french alps and elsewhere similar wooden horns were used for communication in most mountainous regions of europe from the alps to the carpathians alphorns are today used as musical instruments history for long time scholars believed that the alphorn had been derived from the roman etruscan lituus because of their resemblance in shape and because of the word liti meaning alphorn in the dialect of obwalden there is no documented evidence for this theory however and the word liti was probably borrowed from th th century writings in latin where the word lituus could describe various wind instruments such as the horn the crumhorn or the cornett swiss naturalist conrad gesner used the words lituum alpinum for the first known detailed description of the alphorn in his de raris et admirandis herbis in the oldest known document using the german word alphorn is page from account book from the former cistercian abbey st urban near pfaffnau mentioning the payment of two batzen for an itinerant alphorn player from the valais th th century collections of alpine myths and legends suggest that alphorn like instruments had frequently been used as signal instruments in village communities since medieval times or earlier sometimes substituting for the lack of church bells surviving artifacts dating back to as far as ca ad include wooden labrophones in their stretched form like the alphorn or coiled versions such as the büchel and the allgäuisches waldhorn or ackerhorn the alphorn exact origins remain indeterminate and the ubiquity of horn like signal instruments in valleys throughout europe may indicate long history of cross influences regarding their construction and usage construction and qualities swiss playing alphorn the alphorn is carved from solid softwood generally spruce but sometimes pine in former times the alphorn maker would find tree bent at the

bernese oberland michael praetorius mentions an alphorn like instrument under the name of hölzern trummet wooden trumpet in syntagma musicum wittenberg pl viii the alphorn has no lateral openings and therefore gives the pure natural harmonic series of the open pipe the notes of the natural harmonic series overlap but do not exactly correspond to notes found in the familiar chromatic scale in standard western equal temperament most prominently within the alphorn range the th and th harmonics are particularly noticeable because they fall between adjacent notes in the chromatic scale px accomplished alphornists often command range of nearly three octaves consisting of the nd through the th notes of the harmonic series the availability of the higher tones is due in part to the relatively small diameter of the bore of the mouthpiece and tubing in relation to the overall length of the horn dieß ner alphorn players the well known ranz des vaches score audio is traditional
