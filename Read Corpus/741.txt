mary james his father horace ayckbourn was an orchestral violinist at one time deputy leader of the london symphony orchestra his parents who separated shortly after world war ii never married and ayckbourn mother divorced her first husband to marry again in ayckbourn wrote his first play at wisborough lodge preparatory school in the village of wisborough green when he was about whilst at prep school as boarder his mother wrote to tell him she was marrying cecil pye bank manager when he went home for the holidays his new family consisted of his mother his stepfather and christopher his stepfather son by an earlier marriage this relationship too reportedly ran into difficulties early on ayckbourn attended haileybury and imperial service college in the village of hertford heath and whilst there toured europe and america with the school shakespeare company adult life after leaving school at ayckbourn career took several temporary jobs in various places before starting temporary job at the scarborough library theatre where he was introduced to the artistic director stephen joseph it is said that joseph became both mentor and father figure for ayckbourn until his untimely death in and ayckbourn has consistently spoken highly of him ayckbourn career was briefly interrupted when he was called for national service he was swiftly discharged officially on medical grounds but it is suggested that doctor who noticed his reluctance to join the armed forces deliberately failed the medical as favour although ayckbourn continued to move where his career took him he settled in scarborough eventually buying longwestgate house the house formerly owned by stephen joseph in ayckbourn married christine roland another member of the library theatre company and indeed ayckbourn first two plays were written jointly with her under the pseudonym of roland allen they had two sons steven and philip however the marriage had difficulties which eventually led to their separation in ayckbourn said that his relationship with roland became easy once they agreed their marriage was over around this time he started to share home with heather stoney an actress he had first met ten years earlier like his mother neither he nor roland sought divorce for the next thirty years and it was only in that they formally divorced ayckbourn married stoney one side effect of the timing is that as ayckbourn was awarded knighthood few months before the divorce both his first and second wife were entitled to take the title of lady ayckbourn in february he suffered stroke in scarborough and stated hope to be back on my feet or should say my left leg as soon as possible but know it is going to take some time in the meantime am in excellent hands and so is the stephen joseph theatre he left hospital after eight weeks and returned to directing after six months but the following year he announced he would step down as artistic director of the stephen joseph theatre ayckbourn however continues to write and direct his own work at the theatre influence on plays since ayckbourn plays started becoming established in the west end interviewers have raised the question of whether his work is there is no clear answer to this question there has only been one biography written by paul allen and this primarily covers his career in the theatre ayckbourn has frequently said he sees aspects of himself in all his characters for example in bedroom farce he admitted to being in some respects all four of the men in the play it has been suggested that after ayckbourn himself the person who is used the most in his plays is his mother particularly as susan in woman in mind what is less clear is how much influence events in ayckbourn life have had on his writing it is true that the theme of marriages in various difficulties was heavily present throughout his plays in the early seventies around the time his own marriage was coming to an end however by this time he had also witnessed the failures of his parents relationships as well as those of some of his friends which relationships if any he drew on for his plays is unclear in paul allen biography ayckbourn is briefly compared to dafydd and guy in chorus of disapproval both characters feel themselves in trouble and there was speculation that ayckbourn himself may have felt himself to be in trouble at the time he had reportedly become seriously involved with another actress which threatened his relationship with stoney but again it is unclear whether this had any effect on the writing and paul allen view is that it is not current experience that ayckbourn uses for his plays it could be that ayckbourn had written plays with himself and his own issues in mind but as ayckbourn is portrayed as guarded and private man
