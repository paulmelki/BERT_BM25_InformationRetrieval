mjölnir the hammer of thor is one of the major symbols of ásatrú heathenry is modern pagan new religious movement that has been active in the united states since at least the early although the term heathenry is often employed to cover the entire religious movement different heathen groups within the united states often prefer the term ásatrú or odinism as self designations heathenry appeared in the united states during the at the same time as the wider emergence of modern paganism in the united states among the earliest american group was the odinist fellowship founded by danish migrant else christensen in history ásatrú grew steadily in the united states during the in the danish odinist else christensen established the odinist fellowship from her home in florida heavily influenced by alexander rud mills writings she began publication of magazine the odinist although this focused to greater extent on right wing and racialist ideas than theological ones stephen mcnallen first founded the viking brotherhood in the early before creating the ásatrú free assembly afa in which broke up in amid widespread political disagreements after mcnallen repudiation of neo nazis within the group in the mcnallen founded the ásatrú folk assembly afa an ethnically oriented heathen group headquartered in california meanwhile valgard murray and his kindred in arizona founded the ásatrú alliance aa in the late which shared the afa perspectives on race and which published the vor tru newsletter in edred thorsson and james chisholm founded the troth which was incorporated in texas taking an inclusive non racialist view it soon grew into an international organisation terminology in english usage the genitive of æsir faith is often used on its own to denote adherents both singular and plural this term is favored by practitioners who focus on the deities of scandinavia although it is problematic as many asatruar worship deities and entities other than the æsir such as the vanir valkyries elves and dwarves other practitioners term their religion vanatrú meaning those who honour the vanir or dísitrú meaning those who honour the goddesses depending on their particular theological emphasis within the community it is sometimes stated that the term ásatrú pertains to groups which are not racially focused while odinism is the term preferred by racially oriented groups however in practice there is no such neat division in terminology there are notable differences of emphasis between ásatrú as practiced in the us and in scandinavia according to strmiska and sigurvinsson american asatruar tend to prefer more devotional form of worship and more emotional conception of the nordic gods than scandinavian practitioners reflecting the parallel tendency of highly emotional forms of christianity prevalent in the united states demographics although deeming it impossible to calculate the exact size of the heathen community in the us sociologist jeffrey kaplan estimated that in the mid there were around active practitioners in the country with further thousand individuals on the periphery of the movement he noted that the overwhelming majority of individuals in the movement were white male and young most had at least an undergraduate degree and worked in mix of white collar and blue collar jobs from her experience within the community snook concurred that the majority of american heathens were male adding also that most were also white and middle aged but believed that there had been growth in the proportion of heathen women in the us since the mid the pagan census project led by helen berger evan leach and leigh shaffer gained responses from heathens in the us noting that were male and female which they saw as the opposite of the rest of the country pagan community the majority had college education but were generally less well educated than the wider pagan community with lower median income than the wider pagan community too subsequent assessments have suggested larger support base to according to mcnallen and according to the census politics and controversies ásatrú organizations have memberships which span the entire political and spiritual spectrum there is history of political controversy within organized us ásatrú mostly surrounding the question of how to deal with such adherents as place themselves in context of the far right and white supremacy notably resulting in the fragmentation of the asatru free assembly in externally political activity on the part of ásatrú organizations has surrounded campaigns against alleged religious discrimination such as the call for the introduction of an ásatrú emblem of belief by the united states department of veterans affairs to parallel the wiccan pentacle granted to the widow of patrick stewart in in may the hammer of thor was added to the list of united states department of veterans affairs emblems for headstones and markers it was reported in early that heathenry service was held on the navy uss john stennis folkish ásatrú universalism and racialism historically the main dispute between the national organizations has generally centered on the interpretation of nordic heritage as either something cultural or as something genetic or racial in the internal discourse within american ásatrú this cultural racial divide has long been known as universalist vs folkish ásatrú the troth takes the universalist position claiming ásatrú as synonym for northern european heathenry taken to comprise many variations names and practices including theodism irminism odinism and anglo saxon heathenry the asatru folk assembly takes the folkish position claiming that ásatrú and the germanic beliefs are ancestral in nature and as an indigenous religion of the european folk should only be accessed by the descendants of europe in the uk germanic neopaganism is more commonly known as odinism or as heathenry this is mostly matter of terminology and us ásatrú may be equated with uk odinism for practical purposes as is evident in the short lived international asatru odinic alliance of folkish ásatrú odinist groups some groups identifying as ásatrú have been associated with national socialist and white nationalist movements wotansvolk for example is an explicitly racial form more recently however many ásatrú groups have been taking harder
