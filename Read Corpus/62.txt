charles morton updated version of edward bernard orbis eruditi comparing all known alphabets as of an alphabet is standardized set of basic written symbols or graphemes called letters that represent the phonemes of certain spoken languages not all writing systems represent language in this way in syllabary each character represents syllable for instance and logographic systems use characters to represent words morphemes or other semantic units the first fully phonemic script the proto canaanite script later known as the phoenician alphabet is considered to be the first alphabet and is the ancestor of most modern alphabets including arabic cyrillic greek hebrew latin and possibly brahmic it was created by semitic speaking workers and slaves in the sinai peninsula as the proto sinaitic script by selecting small number of hieroglyphs commonly seen in their egyptian surroundings to describe the sounds as opposed to the semantic values of their own canaanite language peter daniels however distinguishes an abugida or alphasyllabary set of graphemes that represent consonantal base letters which diacritics modify to represent vowels as in devanagari and other south asian scripts an abjad in which letters predominantly or exclusively represent consonants as in the original phoenician hebrew or arabic and an alphabet set of graphemes that represent both vowels and consonants in this narrow sense of the word the first true alphabet was the greek alphabet which was developed on the basis of the earlier phoenician alphabet of the dozens of alphabets in use today the most popular is the latin alphabet which was derived from the greek and which many languages modify by adding letters formed using diacritical marks while most alphabets have letters composed of lines linear writing there are also exceptions such as the alphabets used in braille the khmer alphabet for cambodian is the longest with letters alphabets are usually associated with standard ordering of letters this makes them useful for purposes of collation specifically by allowing words to be sorted in alphabetical order it also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of numbering ordered items in such contexts as numbered lists and number placements etymology the english word alphabet came into middle english from the late latin word alphabetum which in turn originated in the greek ἀλφάβητος alphabētos the greek word was made from the first two letters alpha and beta the names for the greek letters came from the first two letters of the phoenician alphabet aleph which also meant ox and bet which also meant house sometimes like in the alphabet song in english the term abcs is used instead of the word alphabet now know my abcs knowing one abcs in general can be used as metaphor for knowing the basics about anything history specimen of typeset fonts and languages by william caslon letter founder from the cyclopaedia ancient northeast african and middle eastern scripts the history of the alphabet started in ancient egypt egyptian writing had set of some hieroglyphs that are called uniliterals to represent syllables that begin with single consonant of their language plus vowel or no vowel to be supplied by the native speaker these glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logograms to write grammatical inflections and later to transcribe loan words and foreign names specimen of proto sinaitic script one of the earliest if not the very first phonemic scripts in the middle bronze age an apparently alphabetic system known as the proto sinaitic script appears in egyptian turquoise mines in the sinai peninsula dated to circa the th century bc apparently left by canaanite workers in john and deborah darnell discovered an even earlier version of this first alphabet at wadi el hol dated to circa bc and showing evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to circa bc strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had been developed about that time based on letter appearances and names it is believed to be based on egyptian hieroglyphs this script had no characters representing vowels although originally it probably was syllabary but unneeded symbols were discarded an alphabetic cuneiform script with signs including three that indicate the following vowel was invented in ugarit before the th century bc this script was not used after the destruction of ugarit the proto sinaitic script eventually developed into the phoenician alphabet which is conventionally called proto canaanite before ca bc the oldest text in phoenician script is an inscription on the sarcophagus of king ahiram this script is the parent script of all western alphabets by the tenth century two other forms can be distinguished namely canaanite and aramaic the aramaic gave rise to the hebrew script the south arabian alphabet sister script to the phoenician alphabet is the script from which the ge ez alphabet an abugida is descended vowelless alphabets are called abjads currently exemplified in scripts including arabic hebrew and syriac the omission of vowels was not always satisfactory solution and some weak consonants are sometimes used to indicate the vowel quality of syllable matres lectionis these letters have dual function since they are also used as pure consonants the proto sinaitic or proto canaanite script and the ugaritic script were the first scripts with limited number of signs in contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time cuneiform egyptian hieroglyphs and linear the phoenician script was probably the first phonemic script and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters making it script simple enough for common traders to learn another advantage of phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages since it recorded words phonemically illustration from acta eruditorum the script was spread by the phoenicians across the mediterranean in greece the script was modified to add vowels giving rise to the ancestor of all alphabets in the west it was the first alphabet in which vowels have independent letter forms separate from those of consonants the greeks chose letters representing sounds that did not
