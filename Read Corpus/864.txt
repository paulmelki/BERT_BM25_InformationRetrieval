in classical mathematics analytic geometry also known as coordinate geometry or cartesian geometry is the study of geometry using coordinate system this contrasts with synthetic geometry analytic geometry is used in physics and engineering and also in aviation rocketry space science and spaceflight it is the foundation of most modern fields of geometry including algebraic differential discrete and computational geometry usually the cartesian coordinate system is applied to manipulate equations for planes straight lines and squares often in two and sometimes three dimensions geometrically one studies the euclidean plane two dimensions and euclidean space three dimensions as taught in school books analytic geometry can be explained more simply it is concerned with defining and representing geometrical shapes in numerical way and extracting numerical information from shapes numerical definitions and representations that the algebra of the real numbers can be employed to yield results about the linear continuum of geometry relies on the cantor dedekind axiom history ancient greece the greek mathematician menaechmus solved problems and proved theorems by using method that had strong resemblance to the use of coordinates and it has sometimes been maintained that he had introduced analytic geometry apollonius of perga in on determinate section dealt with problems in manner that may be called an analytic geometry of one dimension with the question of finding points on line that were in ratio to the others apollonius in the conics further developed method that is so similar to analytic geometry that his work is sometimes thought to have anticipated the work of descartes by some years his application of reference lines diameter and tangent is essentially no different from our modern use of coordinate frame where the distances measured along the diameter from the point of tangency are the abscissas and the segments parallel to the tangent and intercepted between the axis and the curve are the ordinates he further developed relations between the abscissas and the corresponding ordinates that are equivalent to rhetorical equations of curves however although apollonius came close to developing analytic geometry he did not manage to do so since he did not take into account negative magnitudes and in every case the coordinate system was superimposed upon given curve posteriori instead of priori that is equations were determined by curves but curves were not determined by equations coordinates variables and equations were subsidiary notions applied to specific geometric situation persia the th century persian mathematician omar khayyam saw strong relationship between geometry and algebra and was moving in the right direction when he helped close the gap between numerical and geometric algebra with his geometric solution of the general cubic equations but the decisive step came later with descartes omar khayyam is credited with identifying the foundations of algebraic geometry and his book treatise on demonstrations of problems of algebra which laid down the principles of algebra is part of the body of persian mathematics that was eventually transmitted to europe because of his thoroughgoing geometrical approach to algebraic equations khayyam can be considered precursor to descartes in the invention of analytic geometry western europe analytic geometry was independently invented by ren√© descartes and pierre de fermat although descartes is sometimes given sole credit cartesian geometry the alternative term used for analytic geometry is named after descartes descartes made significant progress with the methods in an essay titled la geometrie geometry one of the three accompanying essays appendices published in together with his discourse on the method for rightly directing one reason and searching for truth in the sciences commonly referred to as discourse on method la geometrie written in his native french tongue and its philosophical principles provided foundation for calculus in europe initially the work was not well received due in part to the many gaps in arguments and complicated equations only after the translation into latin and the addition of commentary by van schooten in and further work thereafter did descartes masterpiece receive due recognition pierre de fermat also pioneered the development of analytic geometry although not published in his lifetime manuscript form of ad locos planos et solidos isagoge introduction to plane and solid loci was circulating in paris in just prior to the publication of descartes discourse clearly written and well received the introduction also laid the groundwork for analytical geometry the key difference between fermat and descartes treatments is matter of viewpoint fermat always started with an algebraic equation and then described the geometric curve that satisfied it whereas descartes started with geometric curves and produced their equations as one of several properties of the curves as consequence of this approach descartes had to deal with more complicated equations and he had to develop the methods to work with polynomial equations of higher degree it was leonhard euler who first applied the coordinate method in systematic study of space curves and surfaces coordinates illustration of cartesian coordinate plane four points are marked and labeled with their coordinates in green in red in blue and the origin in purple in analytic geometry the plane is given coordinate system by which every point has pair of real number coordinates similarly euclidean space is given coordinates where every point has three coordinates the value of the coordinates depends on the choice of the initial point of origin there are variety of coordinate systems used but the most common are the following cartesian coordinates in plane or space the most common coordinate system to use is the cartesian coordinate system where each point has an coordinate representing its horizontal position and coordinate representing its vertical position these are typically written as an ordered pair this system can also be used for three dimensional geometry where every point in euclidean space is represented by an ordered triple of coordinates polar coordinates in plane in polar coordinates every point of the plane is represented by its distance from the origin and its angle with normally measured from the positive axis using this notation points are typically written as an ordered pair one may
