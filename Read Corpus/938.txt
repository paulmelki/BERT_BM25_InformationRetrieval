pietro alessandro gaspare scarlatti may october was an italian baroque composer known especially for his operas and chamber cantatas he is considered the most important representative of the neapolitan school of opera he was the father of two other composers domenico scarlatti and pietro filippo scarlatti life scarlatti was born in palermo or in trapani then part of the kingdom of sicily he is generally said to have been pupil of giacomo carissimi in rome and some theorize that he had some connection with northern italy because his early works seem to show the influence of stradella and legrenzi the production at rome of his opera gli equivoci nel sembiante gained him the support of queen christina of sweden who at the time was living in rome and he became her maestro di cappella in february he became maestro di cappella to the viceroy of naples perhaps through the influence of his sister an opera singer who might have been the mistress of an influential neapolitan noble here he produced long series of operas remarkable chiefly for their fluency and expressiveness as well as other music for state occasions in scarlatti left naples and did not return until the spanish domination had been superseded by that of the austrians in the interval he enjoyed the patronage of ferdinando de medici for whose private theatre near florence he composed operas and of cardinal ottoboni who made him his maestro di cappella and procured him similar post at the basilica di santa maria maggiore in rome in after visiting venice and urbino in scarlatti took up his duties in naples again in and remained there until by this time naples seems to have become tired of his music the romans however appreciated it better and it was at the teatro capranica in rome that he produced some of his finest operas telemaco marco attilio regolò la griselda as well as some noble specimens of church music including messa di santa cecilia for chorus and orchestra composed in honor of saint cecilia for cardinal francesco acquaviva in his last work on large scale appears to have been the unfinished erminia serenata for the marriage of the prince of stigliano in he died in naples in and is entombed there at the church of santa maria di montesanto scarlatti music scarlatti as young man scarlatti music forms an important link between the early baroque italian vocal styles of the th century with their centers in florence venice and rome and the classical school of the th century scarlatti style however is more than transitional element in western music like most of his naples colleagues he shows an almost modern understanding of the psychology of modulation and also frequently makes use of the ever changing phrase lengths so typical of the napoli school his early operas gli equivoci nel sembiante honestà negli amori containing the famous aria già il sole dal gange il pompeo containing the well known airs cessate di piagarmi and toglietemi la vita ancor and others down to about retain the older cadences in their recitatives and considerable variety of neatly constructed forms in their charming little arias accompanied sometimes by the string quartet treated with careful elaboration sometimes with the continuo alone by he had definitely established the italian overture form second edition of dal male il bene and had abandoned the ground bass and the binary form air in two stanzas in favour of the ternary form or da capo type of air his best operas of this period are la rosaura printed by the gesellschaft für musikforschung and pirro demetrio in which occur the arias le violette and ben ti sta traditor from about onwards la caduta del decemviri influenced partly perhaps by the style of giovanni bononcini and probably more by the taste of the viceregal court his opera arias become more conventional and commonplace in rhythm while his scoring is hasty and crude yet not without brilliance eraclea the oboes and trumpets being frequently used and the violins often playing in unison the operas composed for ferdinando de medici are lost they might have given more favourable idea of his style as his correspondence with the prince shows that they were composed with very sincere sense of inspiration griselda mitridate eupatore accounted his masterpiece composed for venice in contains music far in advance of anything that scarlatti had written for naples both in technique and in intellectual power the later neapolitan operas amor volubile tiranno la principessa fedele tigrane are showy and effective rather than profoundly emotional the instrumentation marks great advance on previous work since the main duty of accompanying the voice is thrown upon the string quartet the harpsichord being reserved exclusively for the noisy instrumental ritornelli in his opera teodora he originated the use of the orchestral ritornello his last group of operas composed for rome exhibit deeper poetic feeling broad and dignified style of melody strong dramatic sense especially in accompanied recitatives device which he himself had been the first to use as early as olimpia vendicata and much more modern style of orchestration the horns appearing for the first time and being treated with striking effect besides the operas oratorios agar et ismaele esiliati la maddalena la giuditta christmas oratorio filippo neri and others and serenatas which all exhibit similar style scarlatti composed upwards of five hundred chamber cantatas for solo voice these represent the most intellectual type of chamber music of their period and it is to be regretted that they have remained almost entirely in manuscript since careful study of them is indispensable to anyone who wishes to form an adequate idea of scarlatti development his few remaining masses the story of his having composed two hundred is hardly credible and church music in general are comparatively unimportant except the great saint cecilia mass which is one of the first attempts at the style which reached its height in the great masses of johann sebastian bach and ludwig van beethoven
