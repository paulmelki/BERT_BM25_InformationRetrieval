the apollo program also known as project apollo was the third united states human spaceflight program carried out by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa which succeeded in landing the first humans on the moon from to it was first conceived during dwight eisenhower administration as three person spacecraft to follow the one person project mercury which put the first americans in space apollo was later dedicated to president john kennedy national goal for the of landing man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth in an address to congress on may it was the third us human spaceflight program to fly preceded by the two person project gemini conceived in to extend spaceflight capability in support of apollo kennedy goal was accomplished on the apollo mission when astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin landed their apollo lunar module lm on july and walked on the lunar surface while michael collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module csm and all three landed safely on earth on july five subsequent apollo missions also landed astronauts on the moon the last apollo in december in these six spaceflights twelve people walked on the moon buzz aldrin pictured walked on the moon with neil armstrong on apollo july alt astronaut buzz aldrin standing on the moon earthrise the iconic image from apollo taken by astronaut william anders apollo ran from to with the first crewed flight in it encountered major setback in when an apollo cabin fire killed the entire crew during prelaunch test after the first successful landing sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow on landings with plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings but the apollo landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the moon which destroyed the service module capability to provide electrical power crippling the csm propulsion and life support systems the crew returned to earth safely by using the lunar module as lifeboat for these functions apollo used saturn family rockets as launch vehicles which were also used for an apollo applications program which consisted of skylab space station that supported three crewed missions in and apollo soyuz joint us soviet union earth orbit mission in apollo set several major human spaceflight milestones it stands alone in sending crewed missions beyond low earth orbit apollo was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body and apollo was the first crewed spacecraft to land humans on one overall the apollo program returned of lunar rocks and soil to earth greatly contributing to the understanding of the moon composition and geological history the program laid the foundation for nasa subsequent human spaceflight capability and funded construction of its johnson space center and kennedy space center apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and human spaceflight including avionics and computers background origin and spacecraft feasibility studies the apollo program was conceived during the eisenhower administration in early as follow up to project mercury while the mercury capsule could support only one astronaut on limited earth orbital mission apollo would carry three possible missions included ferrying crews to space station circumlunar flights and eventual crewed lunar landings the program was named after apollo the greek god of light music and the sun by nasa manager abe silverstein who later said was naming the spacecraft like name my baby silverstein chose the name at home one evening early in because he felt apollo riding his chariot across the sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program in july nasa deputy administrator hugh dryden announced the apollo program to industry representatives at series of space task group conferences preliminary specifications were laid out for spacecraft with mission module cabin separate from the command module piloting and reentry cabin and propulsion and equipment module on august feasibility study competition was announced and on october three study contracts were awarded to general dynamics convair general electric and the glenn martin company meanwhile nasa performed its own in house spacecraft design studies led by maxime faget to serve as gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs political pressure builds in november john kennedy was elected president after campaign that promised american superiority over the soviet union in the fields of space exploration and missile defense up to the election of kennedy had been speaking out against the missile gap that he and many other senators felt had developed between the soviet union and the united states due to the inaction of president eisenhower beyond military power kennedy used aerospace technology as symbol of national prestige pledging to make the us not first but first and first if but first period despite kennedy rhetoric he did not immediately come to decision on the status of the apollo program once he became president he knew little about the technical details of the space program and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by crewed moon landing when kennedy newly appointed nasa administrator james webb requested percent budget increase for his agency kennedy supported an acceleration of nasa large booster program but deferred decision on the broader issue on april soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person to fly in space reinforcing american fears about being left behind in technological competition with the soviet union at meeting of the us house committee on science and astronautics one day after gagarin flight many congressmen pledged their support for crash program aimed at ensuring that america would catch up kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news refusing to make commitment on america response to the soviets president kennedy delivers his proposal to put man on the moon before joint session of congress may alt
