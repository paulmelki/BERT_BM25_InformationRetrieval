transport in antarctica has transformed from explorers crossing the isolated remote area of antarctica by foot to more open era due to human technologies enabling more convenient and faster transport predominantly by air and water as well as land transportation technologies on remote area like antarctica need to be able to deal with extremely low temperatures and continuous winds to ensure the travelers safety due to the fragility of the antarctic environment only limited amount of transport movements can take place and sustainable transportation technologies have to be used to reduce the ecological footprint the infrastructure of land water and air transport needs to be safe and sustainable currently thousands of tourists and hundreds of scientists year depend on the antarctic transportation system land transport roads winds continuously blow snow on roads in antarctica the south pole traverse mcmurdo south pole highway is approximately long and links the united states mcmurdo station on the coast to the amundsen scott south pole station it was constructed by leveling snow and filling in crevasses but is not paved there are flags to mark the route also the united states antarctic program maintains two ice roads during the austral summer one provides access to pegasus field on the ross ice shelf the ice road between pegasus field and mcmurdo station is about miles the other road provides access to the ice runway which is on sea ice the road between the ice runway and mcmurdo station varies in length from year to year depending on many factors including ice stability these roads are critical for resupplying mcmurdo station scott base and amundsen scott south pole station vehicles the scarcity and poor quality of road infrastructure limits land transportation by conventional vehicles normal car on tires has very limited capability for antarctic conditions scientific bases are often built on snow free areas oases close to the ocean around these stations and on hard packed snow or ice tire based vehicles can drive but on deeper and softer snow normal tire based vehicle cannot travel due to these limitations vehicles on belts have been the preferred option in antarctica in two specialized cars with very large tires running tire pressure as low as psi bar travelled onto the high antarctica plateau giving strong indication that tire based vehicles could be an option for efficient travelling in antarctica mawson station started using classic volkswagen beetles the first production cars to be used in antarctica the first of these was named antarctica in december into february two at cars built in iceland by arctic trucks with tire size of inch tall joined an expedition by the swedish polar institution swea the cars got used to transport people and supplies from the ice shelf to wasa station to perform scanning of the snow and support drilling expedition to on the antarctica plateau this is the first time tire based vehicles successfully travel on the antarctica high plateau in team of six people took part in the ice challenger expedition travelling in specially designed six wheel drive vehicle the team completed the journey from the antarctic coast at patriot hills to the geographic south pole in hours in doing so they easily beat the previous record of days they arrived at the south pole on december the team members on that expedition were andrew regan jason de carteret andrew moon richard griffiths gunnar egilsson and andrew miles the expedition successfully showed that wheeled transport on the continent is not only possible but also often more practical the expedition also hoped to raise awareness about global warming and climate change from start of december into february four at cars were used to support ski race by amundsen omega from to south pole film was made of this race by bbc called on thin ice with ben fogle and james cracknell the cars started from novo airbase at establish route onto the plateau through the crevasse areas in the shcherbakov mountain range driving nearly km to the start line of the ski race for the return journey each car covered between and km with one fuel depot on the way from to date dec tire based cars at and at have been used every season to support various ngo and scientific expedition projects supporting flights fuel drops filming skiers biker tractor collecting snow samples and more the combined distance covered on the antarctica plateau is over thousand km and even though towing capacity is much lower than for most belt based vehicles the tire based cars multiply the travel speed and use only fraction of the fuel making this an option for some expeditions projects second expedition led by andrew regan and andrew moon departed in november the moon regan trans antarctic expedition this time traversed the entire continent twice using two six wheel drive vehicles and concept ice vehicle designed by lotus this time the team used the expedition to raise awareness about the global environmental importance of the antarctic region and to show that biofuel can be viable and environmentally friendly option water transport tour boat in fast ice near the coast antarctica only harbour is at mcmurdo station most coastal stations have offshore anchorages and supplies are transferred from ship to shore by small boats barges and helicopters few stations have basic wharf facility all ships at port are subject to inspection in accordance with article antarctic treaty offshore anchorage is sparse and intermittent but poses no problem to sailboats designed for the ice typically with lifting keels and long shorelines mcmurdo station palmer station government use only except by permit see permit office under legal system number of tour boats ranging from large motorized vessels to small sailing yachts visit the antarctic peninsula during the summer months january march most are based in ushuaia argentina air transport transport in antarctica takes place by air using fixed wing aircraft and helicopters runways and helicopter pads have to be kept snow free to ensure safe take off and landing
