mark tank an armoured fighting vehicle afv is an armed combat vehicle protected by armour generally combining operational mobility with offensive and defensive capabilities afvs can be wheeled or tracked main battle tanks armoured cars armoured self propelled guns infantry fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers are all examples of afvs armoured fighting vehicles are classified according to their intended role on the battlefield and characteristics the classifications are not absolute two countries may classify the same vehicle differently and the criteria change over time for example relatively lightly armed armoured personnel carriers were largely superseded by infantry fighting vehicles with much heavier armament in similar role successful designs are often adapted to wide variety of applications for example the mowag piranha originally designed as an apc has been adapted to fill numerous roles such as mortar carrier infantry fighting vehicle and assault gun armoured fighting vehicles began to appear in use in world war with the armoured car the tank the self propelled gun and the personnel carrier seeing use by world war ii armies had large numbers of afvs together with other vehicles to carry troops this permitted highly mobile manoeuvre warfare evolution of afvs battle of zama by henri paul motte the concept of highly mobile and protected fighting unit has been around for centuries from hannibal war elephants to leonardo contraptions military strategists endeavoured to maximize the mobility and survivability of their soldiers armoured fighting vehicles were not possible until internal combustion engines of sufficient power became available at the start of the th century history helepolis like siege engine showing ballistae stairs and movement capstan modern armoured fighting vehicles represent the realization of an ancient concept that of providing troops with mobile protection and firepower armies have deployed war machines and cavalries with rudimentary armour in battle for millennia use of these animals and engineering designs sought to achieve balance between the conflicting paradoxical needs of mobility firepower and protection siege machine model of vehicle sketched by leonardo da vinci siege engines such as battering rams and siege towers would often be armoured in order to protect their crews from enemy action polyidus of thessaly developed very large movable siege tower the helepolis as early as bc and greek forces used such structures in the siege of rhodes bc the idea of protected fighting vehicle has been known since antiquity frequently cited is leonardo da vinci th century sketch of mobile protected gun platform the drawings show conical wooden shelter with apertures for cannons around the circumference the machine was to be mounted on four wheels which would be turned by the crew through system of hand cranks and cage or lantern gears leonardo claimed will build armored wagons which will be safe and invulnerable to enemy attacks there will be no obstacle which it cannot overcome modern replicas have demonstrated that the human crew would have been able to move it over only short distances war wagon hussite forces in bohemia developed war wagons medieval apc weapon platforms that doubled as wagon forts around during the hussite wars these heavy wagons were given protective sides with firing slits their heavy firepower came from either cannon or from force of hand gunners and crossbowmen supported by light cavalry and infantry using pikes and flails heavy arquebuses mounted on wagons were called arquebus croc these carried ball of about armed and armoured car simms motor scout built in as an armed car the first modern afvs were armed cars dating back virtually to the invention of the motor car the british inventor simms designed and built the motor scout in it was the first armed petrol engine powered vehicle ever built it consisted of de dion bouton quadricycle with maxim machine gun mounted on the front bar an iron shield offered some protection for the driver from the front but it lacked all around protective armour the armoured car was the first modern fully armoured fighting vehicle the first of these was the simms motor war car designed by simms and built by vickers sons maxim in the vehicle had vickers armour mm thick and was powered by four cylinder litre hp cannstatt daimler engine giving it maximum speed of around the armament consisting of two maxim guns was carried in two turrets with traverse simms motor war car the first armoured car to be built another early armoured car of the period was the french charron girardot et voigt presented at the salon de automobile et du cycle in brussels on march the vehicle was equipped with hotchkiss machine gun and with mm armour for the gunner armoured cars were first used in large numbers on both sides during world war as scouting vehicles tank in wells published the short story the land ironclads positing indomitable war machines that would bring new age of land warfare the way steam powered ironclad warships had ended the age of sail wells literary vision was realized in when amidst the pyrrhic standstill of the great war the british landships committee deployed revolutionary armoured vehicles to break the stalemate the tank was envisioned as an armoured machine that could cross ground under fire from machine guns and reply with its own mounted machine guns and cannons these first british heavy tanks of world war moved on caterpillar tracks that had substantially lower ground pressure than wheeled vehicles enabling them to pass the muddy pocked terrain and slit trenches of the battle of the somme troop transport the mark ix tank the first armoured personnel carrier the tank eventually proved highly successful and as technology improved it became weapon that could cross large distances at much higher speeds than supporting infantry and artillery the need to provide the units that would fight alongside the tank led to the development of wide range of specialised afvs especially during the second world war the armoured personnel carrier designed to transport infantry troops to the frontline emerged towards the end of world war
