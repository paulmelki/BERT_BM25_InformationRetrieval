each antibody binds to specific antigen an interaction similar to lock and key an antibody ab also known as an immunoglobulin ig is large shaped protein used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses the antibody recognizes unique molecule of the pathogen called an antigen each tip of the of an antibody contains paratope analogous to lock that is specific for one particular epitope analogous to key on an antigen allowing these two structures to bind together with precision using this binding mechanism an antibody can tag microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system or can neutralize it directly for example by blocking part of virus that is essential for its invasion to allow the immune system to recognize millions of different antigens the antigen binding sites at both tips of the antibody come in an equally wide variety in contrast the remainder of the antibody is relatively constant it only occurs in few variants which define the antibody class or isotype iga igd ige igg or igm the constant region at the trunk of the antibody includes sites involved in interactions with other components of the immune system the class hence determines the function triggered by an antibody after binding to an antigen in addition to some structural features antibodies from different classes also differ in where they are released in the body and at what stage of an immune response together with and cells antibodies are the most important part of the adaptive immune system they occur in two forms attached to cell or in soluble form in extracellular fluids such as blood plasma initially antibodies are attached to the surface of cell they are then referred to as cell receptors bcr after an antigen binds to bcr the cell activates to proliferate and differentiate into either plasma cells which secrete soluble antibodies with the same paratope or memory cells which survive in the body to enable long lasting immunity to the antigen soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids as well as many secretions because these fluids were traditionally known as humors antibody mediated immunity is sometimes known as or considered part of humoral immunity the soluble shaped units can occur individually as monomers or in complexes of two to five units antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably though the term antibody is sometimes reserved for the secreted soluble form excluding cell receptors structure schematic structure of an antibody two heavy chains blue yellow and the two light chains green pink the antigen binding site is circled antibodies are heavy kda proteins of about nm in size arranged in three globular regions that roughly form shape in humans and most mammals an antibody unit consists of four polypeptide chains two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains connected by disulfide bonds each chain is series of domains somewhat similar sequences of about amino acids each these domains are usually represented in simplified schematics as rectangles light chains consist of one variable domain vl and one constant domain cl while heavy chains contain one variable domain vh and three to four constant domains ch ch structurally an antibody is also partitioned into two antigen binding fragments fab containing one vl vh cl and ch domain each as well as the crystallisable fragment fc forming the trunk of the shape in between them is hinge region of the heavy chains whose flexibility allows antibodies to bind to pairs of epitopes at various distances to form complexes dimers trimers etc and to bind effector molecules more easily in an electrophoresis test of blood proteins antibodies mostly migrate to the last gamma globulin fraction conversely most gamma globulins are antibodies which is why the two terms were historically used as synonyms as were the symbols ig and this variant terminology fell out of use due to the correspondence being inexact and due to confusion with heavy chains which characterize the igg class of antibodies antigen binding site the variable domains can also be referred to as the fv region it is the subregion of fab that binds to an antigen more specifically each variable domain contains three hypervariable regions the amino acids seen there vary the most from antibody to antibody when the protein folds these regions give rise to three loops of strands localised near one another on the surface of the antibody these loops are referred to as the complementarity determining regions cdrs since their shape complements that of an antigen three cdrs from each of the heavy and light chains together form an antibody binding site whose shape can be anything from pocket to which smaller antigen binds to larger surface to protrusion that sticks out into groove in an antigen typically however only few residues contribute to most of the binding energy the existence of two identical antibody binding sites allows antibody molecules to bind strongly to multivalent antigen repeating sites such as polysaccharides in bacterial cell walls or other sites at some distance apart as well as to form antibody complexes and larger antigen antibody complexes the resulting cross linking plays role in activating other parts of the immune system the structures of cdrs have been clustered and classified by chothia et al and more recently by north et al and nikoloudis et al in the framework of the immune network theory cdrs are also called idiotypes according to immune network theory the adaptive immune system is regulated by interactions between idiotypes fc region the fc region the trunk of the shape is composed of constant domains from the heavy chains its role is in modulating immune cell activity it is where effector molecules bind to triggering various effects after the antibody fab region binds to an antigen effector cells such as macrophages or natural killer cells bind via their fc receptors fcr to the
