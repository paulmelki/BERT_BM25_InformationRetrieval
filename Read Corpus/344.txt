the term abdominal surgery broadly covers surgical procedures that involve opening the abdomen laparotomy surgery of each abdominal organ is dealt with separately in connection with the description of that organ see stomach kidney liver etc diseases affecting the abdominal cavity are dealt with generally under their own names appendicitis types the most common abdominal surgeries are described below appendectomy surgical opening of the abdominal cavity and removal of the appendix typically performed as definitive treatment for appendicitis although sometimes the appendix is removed incidental to another abdominal procedure caesarean section also known as section is surgical procedure in which one or more incisions are made through mother abdomen laparotomy and uterus hysterotomy to deliver one or more babies or rarely to remove dead fetus inguinal hernia surgery this refers to the repair of an inguinal hernia exploratory laparotomy this refers to the opening of the abdominal cavity for direct examination of its contents for example to locate source of bleeding or trauma it may or may not be followed by repair or removal of the primary problem laparoscopy minimally invasive approach to abdominal surgery where rigid tubes are inserted through small incisions into the abdominal cavity the tubes allow introduction of small camera surgical instruments and gases into the cavity for direct or indirect visualization and treatment of the abdomen the abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas to facilitate visualization and often small video camera is used to show the procedure on monitor in the operating room the surgeon manipulates instruments within the abdominal cavity to perform procedures such as cholecystectomy gallbladder removal the most common laparoscopic procedure the laparoscopic method speeds recovery time and reduces blood loss and infection as compared to the traditional open method complications complications of abdominal surgery include but are not limited to adhesions also called scar tissue complications of postoperative adhesion formation are frequent they have large negative effect on patients health and increase workload in clinical practice bleeding infection paralytic ileus sometimes called ileus short term paralysis of the bowel perioperative mortality death shock sterile technique aseptic post operative care antibiotics use of the who surgical safety checklist and vigilant post operative monitoring greatly reduce the risk of these complications planned surgery performed under sterile conditions is much less risky than that performed under emergency or unsterile conditions the contents of the bowel are unsterile and thus leakage of bowel contents as from trauma substantially increases the risk of infection globally there are few studies comparing perioperative mortality following abdominal surgery across different health systems one major prospective study of adult patients undergoing emergency laparotomy from centres in high middle and low income countries found that mortality is three times higher in low compared with high hdi countries even when adjusted for prognostic factors in this study the overall global mortality rate was per cent at hours high per cent middle per cent low per cent increasing to per cent by days high per cent middle per cent low per cent of the patients who died per cent did so between and days following surgery high per cent middle per cent low per cent patient safety factors were suggested to play an important role with use of the who surgical safety checklist associated with reduced mortality at days taking similar approach unique global study of children undergoing emergency laparotomy from centres in countries showed that adjusted mortality in children following surgery may be as high as times greater in low hdi and middle hdi countries compared with high hdi countries translating to excess deaths per procedures performed in these settings internationally the most common operations performed were appendectomy small bowel resection pyloromyotomy and correction of intussusception after adjustment for patient and hospital risk factors child mortality at days was significantly higher in low hdi adjusted or ci to and middle hdi to countries compared with high hdi countries absorption of drugs administered orally was shown to be significantly affected following abdominal surgery there is low certainty evidence that there is no difference between using scalpel and electrosurgery in infection rates during major abdominal surgeries see also abdominoplasty asa physical status classification system or perioperative physical fitness diabetes general surgery laparotomy low fiber low residue diet perioperative mortality references
