term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music the term is also used albeit rarely as synonym for alla breve early history cappella could be as old as man itself research suggests that singing and vocables may have been what early humans used to communicate before the invention of language the earliest piece of sheet music is thought to have originated from times as early as while the earliest that has survived in its entirety is from the first century piece from greece called the seikilos epitaph religious origins cappella music was originally used in religious music especially church music as well as anasheed and zemirot gregorian chant is an example of cappella singing as is the majority of secular vocal music from the renaissance the madrigal up until its development in the early baroque into an instrumentally accompanied form is also usually in cappella form the psalms note that some early songs were accompanied by string instruments though jewish and early christian music was largely cappella the use of instruments has subsequently increased within both of these religions as well as in islam christian the polyphony of christian cappella music began to develop in europe around the late th century ad with compositions by josquin des prez the early cappella polyphonies may have had an accompanying instrument although this instrument would merely double the singers parts and was not independent by the th century cappella polyphony had further developed but gradually the cantata began to take the place of cappella forms th century cappella polyphony nonetheless continued to influence church composers throughout this period and to the present day recent evidence has shown that some of the early pieces by palestrina such as what was written for the sistine chapel was intended to be accompanied by an organ doubling some or all of the voices such is seen in the life of palestrina becoming major influence on bach most notably in the mass in minor other composers that utilized the cappella style if only for the occasional piece were claudio monteverdi and his masterpiece lagrime amante al sepolcro dell amata lover tears at his beloved grave which was composed in and andrea gabrieli when upon his death it was discovered many choral pieces one of which was in the unaccompanied style learning from the preceding two composeres heinrich

subject matter of that week such as christ suffering and the passion five of schutz historien were easter pieces and of these the latter three which dealt with the passion from three different viewpoints those of matthew luke and john were all done cappella style this was near requirement for this type of piece and the parts of the crowd were sung while the solo parts which were the quoted

liturgies is exclusively sung without instrumental accompaniment bishop kallistos ware says the service is sung even though there may be no choir in the orthodox church today as in the early church singing is unaccompanied and instrumental music is not found this cappella behavior arises from strict interpretation of psalms which states let every thing that hath breath praise the lord praise ye the lord in keeping with this philosophy early russian musika which started appearing in the late th century in what was known as khorovïye kontsertï choral concertos made cappella adaptations of venetian styled pieces such as the treatise grammatika musikiyskaya by nikolai diletsky divine liturgies and western rite masses composed by famous composers such as peter tchaikovsky sergei rachmaninoff alexander arkhangelsky and mykola leontovych are fine examples of this opposition to instruments in worship present day christian religious bodies known for conducting their worship
