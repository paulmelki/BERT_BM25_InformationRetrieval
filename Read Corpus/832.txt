the atari st is line of home computers from atari corporation and the successor to the atari bit family the initial model the st saw limited release in april june and was widely available in july the st is the first personal computer to come with bitmapped color gui using version of digital research gem released in february the st released in is the first personal computer to ship with megabyte of ram in the base configuration and also the first with cost per kilobyte of less than us the atari st is part of mid generation of home computers that have or bit processors kb or more of ram and mouse controlled graphical user interfaces this generation includes the macintosh amiga apple iigs and in some markets the acorn archimedes st officially stands for sixteen thirty two which refers to the motorola bit external bus and bit internals the st was sold with either atari color monitor or the less expensive monochrome monitor the system color graphics modes are only available on the former while the highest resolution mode needs the monochrome monitor in some markets particularly germany the machine gained strong foothold as small business machine for cad and desktop publishing work thanks to its built in midi ports the st enjoyed success for running music sequencer software and as controller of musical instruments among amateurs and well known musicians alike the st was superseded by the atari ste atari tt atari mega ste and falcon computers origins the atari st was born from the rivalry between home computer makers atari inc and commodore international amiga contract jay miner one of the original designers for the custom chips found in the atari and atari bit family tried to convince atari management to create new chipset for video game console and computer when his idea was rejected miner left atari to form small think tank called hi toro in and began designing the new lorraine chipset the company which was later renamed amiga corporation was pretending to sell video game controllers to deceive competition while it developed lorraine based computer amiga ran out of capital to complete lorraine development and atari owned by warner communications paid amiga to continue development work in return atari received exclusive use of the lorraine design for one year as video game console after one year atari would have the right to add keyboard and market the complete computer designated the xld as atari was heavily involved with disney at the time it was later code named mickey and the memory expansion board was codenamed minnie tramel technology after leaving commodore international in january jack tramiel formed tramel technology ltd with his sons and other ex commodore employees and in april began planning new computer the company initially considered the national semiconductor ns microprocessor but was disappointed with its performance this started the move to the the lead designer of the atari st was ex commodore employee shiraz shivji who had previously worked on the commodore development atari in mid was losing about million dollars per day interested in atari overseas manufacturing and worldwide distribution network for his new computer tramiel negotiated with warner in may and june he secured funding and bought atari consumer division which included the console and home computer departments in july as executives and engineers left commodore to join tramel technology commodore responded by filing lawsuits against four former engineers for theft of trade secrets the tramiels did not purchase the employee contracts when they bought the assets of atari inc so one of their first acts was to interview atari inc employees to decide whom to hire at what was essentially brand new company at the time of the purchase of atari inc assets there were roughly employees remaining from high point of after the interviews approximately employees were hired to work at tramel technology which soon changed its name to atari corporation at one point custom sound processor called amy was planned component for the new st computer design but the chip needed more time to complete so amy was dropped in favor of an off the shelf yamaha sound chip it was during this time in late july early august that leonard tramiel discovered the original amiga contract which required amiga corporation to deliver the lorraine chipset to atari on june amiga corp had sought more monetary support from investors in spring among them tramel technology which wished to replace nearly everyone at amiga commodore and amiga having heard rumors that tramiel was negotiating to buy atari amiga corp entered into discussions with commodore the discussions led to commodore wanting to purchase amiga corporation outright which commodore believed would cancel any outstanding contracts including atari instead of amiga corp delivering lorraine to atari commodore delivered check of to atari on amiga behalf in effect returning the funds atari invested into amiga for the chipset tramiel countersued amiga corp on august he sought damages and an injunction to bar amiga and effectively commodore from producing anything with its technology at commodore the amiga team was in limbo during the summer of because of the lawsuit no word on the status of the chipset the lorraine computer or the team fate was known in the fall of commodore informed the team that the lorraine project was active again the chipset was to be improved the operating system os developed and the hardware design completed while commodore announced the amiga with the lorraine chipset in july the delay gave atari with its many former commodore engineers time to deliver the first atari st units in june in march the two companies settled the dispute out of court in closed decision operating system with the hardware design nearing completion the atari team started looking at solutions for the operating system soon after the atari buyout microsoft approached tramiel with the suggestion that they port windows to the platform but the delivery date was out by two years far too long
