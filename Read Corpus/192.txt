the ancient aramaic alphabet was adapted by arameans from the phoenician alphabet and became distinct script by the th century bc it was used to write the aramaic language and had displaced the paleo hebrew alphabet itself derivative of the phoenician alphabet for the writing of hebrew the letters all represent consonants some of which are also used as matres lectionis to indicate long vowels the aramaic alphabet is historically significant since virtually all modern middle eastern writing systems can be traced back to it as well as numerous non chinese writing systems of central and east asia that is primarily from the widespread usage of the aramaic language as both lingua franca and the official language of the neo assyrian and neo babylonian empires and their successor the achaemenid empire among the scripts in modern use the hebrew alphabet bears the closest relation to the imperial aramaic script of the th century bc with an identical letter inventory and for the most part nearly identical letter shapes the aramaic alphabet was an ancestor to the nabataean alphabet and the later arabic alphabet writing systems like the aramaic one that indicate consonants but do not indicate most vowels other than by means of matres lectionis or added diacritical signs have been called abjads by peter daniels to distinguish them from alphabets such as the greek alphabet which represent vowels more systematically the term was coined to avoid the notion that writing system that represents sounds must be either syllabary or an alphabet which would imply that system like aramaic must be either syllabary as argued by ignace gelb or an incomplete or deficient alphabet as most other writers have said rather it is different type origins mauryan emperor ashoka at kandahar afghanistan rd century bc the earliest inscriptions in the aramaic language use the phoenician alphabet over time the alphabet developed into the form shown below aramaic gradually became the lingua franca throughout the middle east with the script at first complementing and then displacing assyrian cuneiform as the predominant writing system achaemenid empire the first persian empire around bc following the achaemenid conquest of mesopotamia under darius old aramaic was adopted by the persians as the vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast persian empire with its different peoples and languages the use of single official language which modern scholarship has dubbed as official aramaic imperial aramaic or achaemenid aramaic can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the achaemenid persians in holding their far flung empire together for as long as they did imperial aramaic was highly standardised its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect and was inevitably influenced by old persian the aramaic glyph forms of the period are often divided into two main styles the lapidary form usually inscribed on hard surfaces like stone monuments and cursive form whose lapidary form tended to be more conservative by remaining more visually similar to phoenician and early aramaic both were in use through the achaemenid persian period but the cursive form steadily gained ground over the lapidary which had largely disappeared by the rd century bc one of the tayma stones stele with dedicatory lapidary aramaic inscription to the god salm sandstone th century bc found in tayma saudi arabia by charles huber in and now in the louvre for centuries after the fall of the achaemenid empire in bc imperial aramaic or something near enough to it to be recognisable would remain an influence on the various native iranian languages the aramaic script would survive as the essential characteristics of the iranian pahlavi writing system aramaic documents from bactria have been recently discovered an analysis of which was published in november the texts which were rendered on leather reflect the use of aramaic in the th century bc in the persian achaemenid administration of bactria and sogdiana the widespread usage of achaemenid aramaic in the middle east led to the gradual adoption of the aramaic alphabet for writing hebrew formerly hebrew had been written using an alphabet closer in form to that of phoenician the paleo hebrew alphabet aramaic derived scripts since the evolution of the aramaic alphabet out of the phoenician one was gradual process the division of the world alphabets into the ones derived from the phoenician one directly and the ones derived from phoenician via aramaic is somewhat artificial in general the alphabets of the mediterranean region anatolia greece italy are classified as phoenician derived adapted from around the th century bc and those of the east the levant persia central asia and india are considered aramaic derived adapted from around the th century bc from the imperial aramaic script of the achaemenid empire after the fall of the achaemenid empire the unity of the imperial aramaic script was lost diversifying into number of descendant cursives the hebrew and nabataean alphabets as they stood by the roman era were little changed in style from the imperial aramaic alphabet ibn khaldun alleges that not only the old nabataean writing was influenced by the syrian script aramaic but also the old chaldean script cursive hebrew variant developed from the early centuries ad but it remained restricted to the status of variant used alongside the noncursive by contrast the cursive developed out of the nabataean alphabet in the same period soon became the standard for writing arabic evolving into the arabic alphabet as it stood by the time of the early spread of islam the development of cursive versions of aramaic also led to the creation of the syriac palmyrene and mandaic alphabets which formed the basis of the historical scripts of central asia such as the sogdian and mongolian alphabets the old turkic script is generally considered to have its ultimate origins in aramaic in particular via the pahlavi or sogdian alphabets as suggested by thomsen or possibly via kharosthi cf issyk inscription aramaic is also considered to be the most likely source
