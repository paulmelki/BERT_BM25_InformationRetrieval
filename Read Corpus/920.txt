in optics and lens design the abbe number also known as the number or constringence of transparent material is an approximate measure of the material dispersion change of refractive index versus wavelength with high values of indicating low dispersion it is named after ernst abbe the german physicist who defined it the term number should not be confused with the normalized frequency in fibers refractive index variation for sf flint glass bk borosilicate crown glass and fused quartz and calculation for two abbe numbers for sf the abbe number vd of material is defined as where and are the refractive indices of the material at the wavelengths of the fraunhofer and spectral lines nm nm and nm respectively this formulation only applies to the visible spectrum outside this range requires the use of different spectral lines for non visible spectral lines the term number is more commonly used the more general formulation defined as where short center and long are the refractive indices of the material at three different wavelengths the shortest wavelength index is short and the longest is long abbe numbers are used to classify glass and other optical materials in terms of their chromaticity for example the higher dispersion flint glasses have of material versus its refractive index glasses can then be categorised and selected according to their positions on the diagram this can be letter number code as used in the schott glass catalogue or digit glass code glasses abbe numbers along with their mean refractive indices are used in the calculation of the required refractive powers of the elements of achromatic lenses in order to cancel chromatic aberration to first order note that these two parameters which enter into the equations for design of achromatic doublets are exactly what is plotted on an abbe diagram due to the difficulty and inconvenience in producing sodium and hydrogen lines alternate definitions of the abbe number are often substituted iso rather than the standard definition above using the refractive index variation between the and hydrogen lines an alternative measure using the subscript takes the difference between the refractive indices of the blue and red cadmium lines at nm and nm with ne referring to the wavelength of the mercury line nm other definitions can similarly be employed the following table lists standard wavelengths at which is commonly determined including the standard subscripts employed in nm fraunhofer symbol light source color hg uv hg violet hg blue cd blue blue hg green he yellow na yellow cd red red he red ir cs ir hg ir see also abbe prism abbe refractometer calculation of glass properties including abbe number glass code sellmeier equation more comprehensive and physically based modeling of dispersion references external links abbe graph and data for glasses from ohara hoya and schott
