flavius arcadius january may was roman emperor from to he was the eldest son of the augustus theodosius and his first wife aelia flaccilla and the brother of honorius arcadius ruled the eastern half of the empire from when their father died while honorius ruled the west weak ruler his reign was dominated by series of powerful ministers and by his wife aelia eudoxia life birth and reign to the fall of eutropius arcadius was born in in hispania the eldest son of theodosius and aelia flaccilla and brother of honorius who would become the western roman emperor in january at the age of his father declared him an augustus and co ruler for the eastern half of the empire his younger brother was later declared augustus in for the western half during these early years arcadius was under the tutelage of the rhetorician themistius and arsenius zonaras monk as emperors both of theodosius sons revealed themselves to have weak characters and therefore were able to be dominated by ambitious subordinates although left as regent in constantinople by his father in when theodosius went west to fight arbogastes and eugenius at theodosius death in january the ten year old honorius was placed under the guardianship of the magister militum flavius stilicho while the seventeen year old arcadius quickly fell under the influence of the praetorian prefect of the east rufinus ambitious and unprincipled rufinus quickly attempted to have arcadius marry his daughter and to become arcadius father in law however during an absence in antioch where according to zosimus rufinus had lucianus the comes orientis flogged to death with whips loaded with lead arcadius was shown painting of aelia eudoxia the daughter of the deceased frankish magister militum per orientem bauto introduced to arcadius by the eunuch eutropius the praepositus sacri cubiculi the young emperor swiftly fell in love and the marriage was quickly arranged with the ceremony performed on april according to zosimus rufinus was under the impression right until the last minute when the nuptial procession went to eudoxia residence rather than his own that it was his daughter who was to be married to arcadius that eudoxia was raised after her father death by general who was rival of rufinus demonstrates the shifting of the centres of power in the eastern court this jostling for power in the eastern court from one individual to another would be recurring feature of arcadius reign the first crisis facing the young emperor was the rebellion of the visigoths in under the command of alaric who sought to take advantage of the accession of two inexperienced roman emperors as alaric marched towards constantinople plundering macedonia and thrace the eastern court was unable to deal with them as theodosius had taken the majority of the eastern regiments with him to italy and were now in the hands of stilicho perhaps sensing an opportunity to consolidate his power of the eastern half of the empire as well stilicho declared that theodosius had made him guardian over both his sons declaring he was marching to deal with alaric he set off to the east reaching thessaly leading both his own forces as well as the gothic mercenaries whom theodosius had taken west in the civil war with eugenius arcadius and rufinus were more concerned by the threat of stilicho than by one of alaric arcadius ordered stilicho not to proceed any further but instead to send back the eastern regiments stilicho complied falling back to salona while the gothic mercenaries under the command of gainas marched onwards to constantinople when arcadius and rufinus greeted gainas with his army in the campus martius outside of constantinople on november rufinus was suddenly assassinated on the parade ground by the goths on the orders of stilicho and possibly with the support of eutropius with rufinus death they were eutropius and arcadius wife eudoxia who would assume roles of advisor and or guardian of the emperor in place of rufinus while eutropius consolidated his hold on power in the capital the distracted government continued to turn blind eye to the presence of alaric in greece although at first eutropius may have coordinated with stilicho around the defence of illyricum by when stilicho had returned and proceeded to blockade alaric who then retreated into epirus the atmosphere of the eastern court had changed as neither arcadius nor eutropius was keen to have stilicho intervening in the affairs of the eastern empire they provided no further military aid to stilicho who then abandoned the blockade of the visigoths at eutropius urging arcadius declared stilicho to be hostis publicus and came to an arrangement with alaric making him magister militum per illyricum at around the same time the eastern court persuaded gildo the magister utriusque militiae per africam to transfer his allegiance from honorius to arcadius causing relations between the two imperial courts to deteriorate further eutropius influence lasted four years during which time he sought to marginalise the military and promote the civilian offices within the bureaucracy he brought to trial two prominent military officers timasius and abundantius he also had arcadius introduce two administrative innovations the running of the cursus publicus office of postmaster general and the office in charge of manufacturing military equipment was transferred from the praetorian prefects to the magister officiorum master of offices secondly the role that eutropius held the praepositus sacri cubiculi grand chamberlain was given the rank of illustris and therefore equal in rank to the praetorian prefects in the autumn of he issued law in arcadius name targeting the roman military where any conspiracy involving soldiers or the barbarian regiments against persons holding the rank of illustris was considered to be treason with the conspirators to be sentenced to death and their descendants to be deprived of citizenship although in eutropius led successful campaign against the huns in roman armenia his convincing of arcadius to grant him the consulship for triggered protests across the empire for traditionalists the granting of the consulship
