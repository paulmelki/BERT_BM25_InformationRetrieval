in first place in the afc west thus in the chiefs will play two games against each of its division rivals highlighted in light blue one game against each team in the afc east and nfc south highlighted in yellow and one game each against the first place finishers in the afc north and afc south highlighted in orange currently the thirteen opponents each team faces over the game regular season schedule are set using pre determined formula each afc team plays the other teams in their respective division twice home and away during the regular season in addition to other games assigned to their schedule by the nfl two of these games are assigned on the basis of particular team final divisional standing from the previous season the remaining games are split between the roster of two other nfl divisions this assignment shifts each year and will follow standard cycle using the regular season schedule as an example each team in the afc west plays against every team in the afc north and nfc south in this way non divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents the exception being the two games assigned based on the team prior season divisional standing at the end of each season the four division winners and three wild cards non division winners with best regular season record in the afc qualify for the playoffs the afc playoffs culminate in the afc championship

steelers had played since was moved from the nfl to become the new afc central upon the completion of the merger of the afl and nfl in the newly minted american football conference had already agreed upon their divisional setup along mostly geographical lines for the season the national football conference however could not agree upon their setup and one was chosen from fishbowl on january since the merger five expansion teams have joined the afc and two have left thus making the current total when the seattle seahawks and the tampa bay buccaneers joined the league in they were temporarily placed in the nfc and afc respectively this arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences the seahawks eventually returned to the nfc as result of the realignment the expansion jacksonville jaguars joined the afc in there have been five teams that have relocated at least once in the baltimore colts relocated to indianapolis in the cleveland browns had attempted to move to baltimore the resulting dispute between cleveland and the team led to modell establishing the baltimore ravens with the players and personnel from the browns while the browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the nfl the ravens were treated as an expansion team in california the oakland raiders relocated to los angeles in back to oakland in and then to
