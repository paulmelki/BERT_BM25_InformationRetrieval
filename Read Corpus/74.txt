map of the most populous part of asia showing physical political and population characteristics as per asia is earth largest and most populous continent located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres it shares the continental landmass of eurasia with the continent of europe and the continental landmass of afro eurasia with both europe and africa asia covers an area of about of earth total land area and of the earth total surface area the continent which has long been home to the majority of the human population was the site of many of the first civilizations asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions its billion people constitute roughly of the world population in general terms asia is bounded on the east by the pacific ocean on the south by the indian ocean and on the north by the arctic ocean the border of asia with europe is historical and cultural construct as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them it is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity the division of eurasia into two continents reflects east west cultural linguistic and ethnic differences some of which vary on spectrum rather than with sharp dividing line the most commonly accepted boundaries place asia to the east of the suez canal separating it from africa and to the east of the turkish straits the ural mountains and ural river and to the south of the caucasus mountains and the caspian and black seas separating it from europe china and india alternated in being the largest economies in the world from to ce china was major economic power and attracted many to the east and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of india personified asia attracting european commerce exploration and colonialism the accidental discovery of trans atlantic route from europe to america by columbus while in search for route to india demonstrates this deep fascination the silk road became the main east west trading route in the asian hinterlands while the straits of malacca stood as major sea route asia has exhibited economic dynamism particularly east asia as well as robust population growth during the th century but overall population growth has since fallen asia was the birthplace of most of the world mainstream religions including hinduism zoroastrianism judaism jainism buddhism confucianism taoism christianity islam sikhism as well as many other religions given its size and diversity the concept of asia name dating back to classical antiquity may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups cultures environments economics historical ties and government systems it also has mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the middle east temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in siberia definition and boundaries asia africa boundary the boundary between asia and africa is the red sea the gulf of suez and the suez canal this makes egypt country with the sinai peninsula in asia and the remainder of the country in africa asia europe boundary modern definition mostly fits with the lines and in this image the threefold division of the old world into europe asia and africa has been in use since the th century bc due to greek geographers such as anaximander and hecataeus anaximander placed the boundary between asia and europe along the phasis river the modern rioni river in georgia of caucasus from its mouth by poti on the black sea coast through the surami pass and along the kura river to the caspian sea convention still followed by herodotus in the th century bc during the hellenistic period this convention was revised and the boundary between europe and asia was now considered to be the tanais the modern don river this is the convention used by roman era authors such as posidonius strabo and ptolemy the border between asia and europe was historically defined by european academics the don river became unsatisfactory to northern europeans when peter the great king of the tsardom of russia defeating rival claims of sweden and the ottoman empire to the eastern lands and armed resistance by the tribes of siberia synthesized new russian empire extending to the ural mountains and beyond founded in the major geographical theorist of the empire was former swedish prisoner of war taken at the battle of poltava in and assigned to tobolsk where he associated with peter siberian official vasily tatishchev and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for future book in sweden five years after peter death in philip johan von strahlenberg published new atlas proposing the ural mountains as the border of asia tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von strahlenberg the latter had suggested the emba river as the lower boundary over the next century various proposals were made until the ural river prevailed in the mid th century the border had been moved perforce from the black sea to the caspian sea into which the ural river projects the border between the black sea and the caspian is usually placed along the crest of the caucasus mountains although it is sometimes placed further north asia oceania boundary the border between asia and the region of oceania is usually placed somewhere in the malay archipelago the maluku islands in indonesia are often considered to lie on the border of southeast asia with new guinea to the east of the islands being wholly part of oceania the terms southeast asia and oceania devised in the th century have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception the chief factor in determining which islands of the malay archipelago are asian has been the location of the colonial
