illustration of the axiom of choice with each and represented as jar and colored marble respectively family of sets indexed over the real numbers that is there is set for each real number with small sample shown above each set contains at least one and possibly infinitely many elements the axiom of choice allows us to arbitrarily select single element from each set forming corresponding family of elements also indexed over the real numbers with drawn from in general the collections may be indexed over any set not just in mathematics the axiom of choice or ac is an axiom of set theory equivalent to the statement that cartesian product of collection of non empty sets is non empty informally put the axiom of choice says that given any collection of bins each containing at least one object it is possible to make selection of exactly one object from each bin even if the collection is infinite formally it states that for every indexed family of nonempty sets there exists an indexed family of elements such that for every the axiom of choice was formulated in by ernst zermelo in order to formalize his proof of the well ordering theorem in many cases such selection can be made without invoking the axiom of choice this is in particular the case if the number of sets is finite or if selection rule is available some distinguishing property that happens to hold for exactly one element in each set an illustrative example is sets picked from the natural numbers from such sets one may always select the smallest number given the sets the set containing each smallest element is in this case select the smallest number is choice function even if infinitely many sets were collected from the natural numbers it will always be possible to choose the smallest element from each set to produce set that is the choice function provides the set of chosen elements however no choice function is known for the collection of all non empty subsets of the real numbers if there are non constructible reals in that case the axiom of choice must be invoked bertrand russell coined an analogy for any even infinite collection of pairs of shoes one can pick out the left shoe from each pair to obtain an appropriate selection this makes it possible to directly define choice function for an infinite collection of pairs of socks assumed to have no distinguishing features there is no obvious way to make function that selects one sock from each pair without invoking the axiom of choice although originally controversial the axiom of choice is now used without reservation by most mathematicians and it is included in the standard form of axiomatic set theory zermelo fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice zfc one motivation for this use is that number of generally accepted mathematical results such as tychonoff theorem require the axiom of choice for their proofs contemporary set theorists also study axioms that are not compatible with the axiom of choice such as the axiom of determinacy the axiom of choice is avoided in some varieties of constructive mathematics although there are varieties of constructive mathematics in which the axiom of choice is embraced statement choice function is function defined on collection of nonempty sets such that for every set in is an element of with this concept the axiom can be stated formally this may be expressed as follows thus the negation of the axiom of choice states that there exists collection of nonempty sets that has no choice function each choice function on collection of nonempty sets is an element of the cartesian product of the sets in this is not the most general situation of cartesian product of family of sets where given set can occur more than once as factor however one can focus on elements of such product that select the same element every time given set appears as factor and such elements correspond to an element of the cartesian product of all distinct sets in the family the axiom of choice asserts the existence of such elements it is therefore equivalent to given any family of nonempty sets their cartesian product is nonempty set nomenclature zf ac and zfc in this article and other discussions of the axiom of choice the following abbreviations are common ac the axiom of choice zf zermelo fraenkel set theory omitting the axiom of choice zfc zermelo fraenkel set theory extended to include the axiom of choice variants there are many other equivalent statements of the axiom of choice these are equivalent in the sense that in the presence of other basic axioms of set theory they imply the axiom of choice and are implied by it one variation avoids the use of choice functions by in effect replacing each choice function with its range given any set of pairwise disjoint non empty sets there exists at least one set that contains exactly one element in common with each of the sets in this guarantees for any partition of set the existence of subset of containing exactly one element from each part of the partition another equivalent axiom only considers collections that are essentially powersets of other sets for any set the power set of with the empty set removed has choice function authors who use this formulation often speak of the choice function on but this is slightly different notion of choice function its domain is the power set of with the empty set removed and so makes sense for any set whereas with the definition used elsewhere in this article the domain of choice function on collection of sets is that collection and so only makes sense for sets of sets with this alternate notion of choice function the axiom of choice can be compactly stated as every set has choice function which is equivalent to for any set there is function such that for any non empty subset
