gal√°pagos archipelago which are thought to have evolved via an adaptive radiation that diversified their beak shapes enabling them to exploit different food sources px in evolutionary biology adaptive radiation is process in which organisms diversify rapidly from an ancestral species into multitude of new forms particularly when change in the environment makes new resources available alters biotic interactions or opens new environmental niches starting with single ancestor this process results in the speciation and phenotypic adaptation of an array of species exhibiting different morphological and physiological traits the prototypical example of adaptive radiation is finch speciation on the galapagos darwin finches but examples are known from around the world characteristics four features can be used to identify an adaptive radiation common ancestry of component species specifically recent ancestry note that this is not the same as monophyly in which all descendants of common ancestor are included phenotype environment correlation significant association between environments and the morphological and physiological traits used to exploit those environments trait utility the performance or fitness advantages of trait values in their corresponding environments rapid speciation presence of one or more bursts in the emergence of new species around the time that ecological and phenotypic divergence is underway conditions adaptive radiations are thought to be triggered by an ecological opportunity or new adaptive zone sources of ecological opportunity can be the loss of antagonists competitors or predators the evolution of key innovation or dispersal to new environment any one of these ecological opportunities has the potential to result in an increase in population size and relaxed stabilizing constraining selection as genetic diversity is positively correlated with population size the expanded population will have more genetic diversity compared to the ancestral population with reduced stabilizing selection phenotypic diversity can also increase in addition intraspecific competition will increase promoting divergent selection to use wider range of resources this ecological release provides the potential for ecological speciation and thus adaptive radiation occupying new environment might take place under the following conditions new habitat has opened up volcano for example can create new ground in the middle of the ocean this is the case in places like hawaii and the galapagos for aquatic species the formation of large new lake habitat could serve the same purpose the tectonic movement that formed the east african rift ultimately leading to the creation of the rift valley lakes is an example of this an extinction event could effectively achieve this same result opening up niches that were previously occupied by species that no longer exist this new habitat is relatively isolated when volcano erupts on the mainland and destroys an adjacent forest it is likely that the terrestrial plant and animal species that used to live in the destroyed region will recolonize without evolving greatly however if newly formed habitat is isolated the species that colonize it will likely be somewhat random and uncommon arrivals the new habitat has wide availability of niche space the rare colonist can only adaptively radiate into as many forms as there are niches examples darwin finches darwin finches are an often used textbook example of adaptive radiation today represented by approximately species darwin finches are galapagos endemics famously adapted for specialized feeding behavior although one species the cocos finch pinaroloxias inornata is not found in the galapagos but on the island of cocos south of costa rica darwin finches are not actually finches in the true sense but are members of the tanager family thraupidae and are derived from single ancestor that arrived in the galapagos from mainland south america perhaps just million years ago excluding the cocos finch each species of darwin finch is generally widely distributed in the galapagos and fills the same niche on each island for the ground finches this niche is diet of seeds and they have thick bills to facilitate the consumption of these hard materials the ground finches are further specialized to eat seeds of particular size the large ground finch geospiza magnirostris is the largest species of darwin finch and has the thickest beak for breaking open the toughest seeds the small ground finch geospiza fuliginosa has smaller beak for eating smaller seeds and the medium ground finch geospiza fortis has beak of intermediate size for optimal consumption of intermediately sized seeds relative to magnirostris and fuliginosa there is some overlap for example the most robust medium ground finches could have beaks larger than those of the smallest large ground finches because of this overlap it can be difficult to tell the species apart by eye though their songs differ these three species often occur sympatrically and during the rainy season in the galapagos when food is plentiful they specialize little and eat the same easily accessible foods it was not well understood why their beaks were so adapted until peter and rosemary grant studied their feeding behavior in the long dry season and discovered that when food is scarce the ground finches use their specialized beaks to eat the seeds that they are best suited to eat and thus avoid starvation the other finches in the galapagos are similarly uniquely adapted for their particular niche the cactus finches geospiza sp have somewhat longer beaks than the ground finches that serve the dual purpose of allowing them to feed on opuntia cactus nectar and pollen while these plants are flowering but on seeds during the rest of the year the warbler finches certhidea sp have short pointed beaks for eating insects the woodpecker finch camarhynchus pallidus has slender beak which it uses to pick at wood in search of insects it also uses small sticks to reach insect prey inside the wood making it one of the few animals that use tools the mechanism by which the finches initially diversified is still an area of active research one proposition is that the finches were able to have non adaptive allopatric speciation event on separate islands in the archipelago such that when they reconverged on some islands they were
