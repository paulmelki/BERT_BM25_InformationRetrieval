ammonius saccas fl rd century ad was an egyptian philosopher from alexandria who was often referred to as one of the founders of neoplatonism he is mainly known as the teacher of plotinus whom he taught for eleven years from to he was undoubtedly the biggest influence on plotinus in his development of neoplatonism although little is known about his own philosophical views later christian writers stated that ammonius was christian but it is now generally assumed that there was different ammonius of alexandria who wrote biblical texts life while many scholars have interpreted the cognomen sakkas as indicating he was porter in his youth others have asserted that this is misreading of sakkas for sakkophoros porter which is grammatically incorrect and or have connected the moniker with the śākyas an ancient ruling clan of india and thus have claimed that ammonius saccas was of indian origin this latter view has both been subsequently contested and supported by more recent scholarship some scholars supporting the view of the indian origins of ammonius saccas have also contended that said ancestry is consistent with the passion of his foremost student plotinus for india and helps to explain the philosophical similarities between vedanta and neoplatonism which are increasingly attributed to indian influence most details of his life come from the fragments left from porphyry writings the most famous pupil of ammonius saccas was plotinus who studied under ammonius for eleven years according to porphyry in at the age of plotinus went to alexandria to study philosophy in his twenty eighth year he plotinus felt the impulse to study philosophy and was recommended to the teachers in alexandria who then had the highest reputation but he came away from their lectures so depressed and full of sadness that he told his trouble to one of his friends the friend understanding the desire of his heart sent him to ammonius whom he had not so far tried he went and heard him and said to his friend this is the man was looking for from that day he stayed continually with ammonius and acquired so complete training in philosophy that he became eager to make acquaintance with the persian philosophical discipline and that prevailing among the indians according to porphyry the parents of ammonius were christians but upon learning greek philosophy ammonius rejected his parents religion for paganism this conversion is contested by the christian writers jerome and eusebius who state that ammonius remained christian throughout his lifetime porphyry plainly utters falsehood for what will not an opposer of christians do when he says that ammonius fell from life of piety into heathen customs ammonius held the divine philosophy unshaken and unadulterated to the end of his life his works yet extant show this as he is celebrated among many for the writings which he has left however we are told by longinus that ammonius wrote nothing and if ammonius was the principal influence on plotinus then it is unlikely that ammonius would have been christian one way to explain much of the confusion concerning ammonius is to assume that there were two people called ammonius ammonius saccas who taught plotinus and an ammonius the christian who wrote biblical texts another explanation might be that there was only one ammonius but that origen who found the neo platonist views of his teacher essential to his own beliefs about the essential nature of christianity chose to suppress ammonius choice of paganism over christianity the insistence of eusebius origen pupil and jerome all of whom were recognized fathers of the christian church that ammonius saccas had not rejected his christian roots would be easier for christians to accept than the assertion of prophyry who was pagan that ammonius had chosen paganism over christianity to add to the confusion it seems that ammonius had two pupils called origen origen the christian and origen the pagan it is quite possible that ammonius saccas taught both origens and since there were two origens who were accepted as contemporaries it was easy for later christians to accept that there were two individuals named ammonius one christian and one pagan among ammonius other pupils there were herennius and cassius longinus philosophy hierocles writing in the th century states that ammonius fundamental doctrine was that plato and aristotle were in full agreement with each other he was the first who had godly zeal for the truth in philosophy and despised the views of the majority which were disgrace to philosophy he apprehended well the views of each of the two philosophers plato and aristotle and brought them under one and the same nous and transmitted philosophy without conflicts to all of his disciples and especially to the best of those acquainted with him plotinus origen and their successors according to nemesius bishop and neoplatonist ammonius held that the soul was immaterial little is known about ammonius role in the development of neoplatonism porphyry seems to suggest that ammonius was instrumental in helping plotinus think about philosophy in new ways but he plotinus did not just speak straight out of these books but took distinctive personal line in his consideration and brought the mind of ammonius to bear on the investigation in hand two of ammonius students origen the pagan and longinus seem to have held philosophical positions which were closer to middle platonism than neoplatonism which perhaps suggests that ammonius doctrines were also closer to those of middle platonism than the neoplatonism developed by plotinus see the enneads but plotinus does not seem to have thought that he was departing in any significant way from that of his master see also
