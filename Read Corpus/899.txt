decommissioned syrian army stug iii assault gun with mm main armament an assault gun is form of self propelled artillery which uses an infantry support gun mounted on motorized chassis normally an armored fighting vehicle assault guns are designed to provide direct fire support for infantry attacks especially against other infantry or fortified positions the term is literal translation of the german word sturmgeschütz which was applied to the first purpose built assault gun the stug iii in historically the concept of assault guns was very similar to that of the infantry tank as both were combat vehicles intended to accompany infantry formations into battle however during world war ii assault guns were more mobile than tanks and could be utilized as both direct and indirect fire artillery although they could approximate the firepower of tank assault guns mostly fired high explosive shells at relatively low velocities which were well suited for their role of knocking out hard points such as fortified positions and buildings they were not intended to be deployed as tank substitutes or dedicated tank destroyers nevertheless as the conflict progressed the increasing proliferation of tanks on the battlefield forced many assault gun units to engage armor in defense of the infantry and led to armies becoming more dependent on multipurpose designs which combined the traditionally separate roles of an assault gun and tank destroyer german and soviet assault guns introduced during world war ii usually carried their main armament in fully enclosed casemate rather than gun turret although this limited the field of fire and traverse of the armament it also had the advantage of reduced silhouette and simplified the manufacturing process the united states never developed purpose built assault gun during the war although it did modify preexisting armored fighting vehicles for that role including the sherman and stuart tanks and the half track the assault gun concept was largely abandoned during the postwar era in favor of tanks or multipurpose tank destroyers attached to infantry formations which were also capable of providing direct fire support as needed in the united states and most western countries the assault gun ceased to be recognized as unique niche with individual examples being classified either as self propelled howitzer or tank the soviet union continued funding development of new assault guns as late as although few of its postwar designs were adopted in large numbers in soviet and other eastern european armies the traditional assault gun was primarily superseded by tank destroyers such as the su capable of supporting either infantry or armor history world war ii the soviet su was easily constructed in small factories incapable of producing proper tanks assault guns were primarily used during world war ii by the forces of nazi germany and the soviet union early in the war the germans began to create makeshift assault guns by mounting their infantry support weapons on the bed of truck or on obsolete tanks with the turret removed later in the war both the germans and the soviets introduced fully armoured purpose built assault guns into their arsenals early on the soviets built the kv variant of the kv heavy tank with short barrelled mm howitzer mounted in an oversized turret this was not success in battle and was replaced with very successful series of turretless assault guns the su su and the heavy su which were followed by the isu and isu on the new is heavy tank chassis sturmtiger in the deutsches panzermuseum at munster lower saxony the primary german assault gun was the sturmgeschütz iii stug iii at about the same time march as the howitzer like kwk gun was dropped from the panzer iv use its sturmkanone equivalent in the stug iii up to that time was likewise replaced with longer barreled high velocity dual purpose mm gun that had also been derived from the successful pak anti tank towed artillery piece the germans also built number of other fully armoured turretless assault guns including the stug iv stuig brummbär and sturmtiger the latter two were very heavy vehicles and were built only in small quantities battalions of assault guns usually stug iiis commonly replaced the intended panzer battalion in the german panzergrenadier divisions due to the chronic shortage of tanks and were sometimes used as makeshifts even in the panzer divisions independent battalions were also deployed as stiffeners for infantry divisions and the stug iii anti tank capabilities bolstered dwindling tank numbers on the eastern and western fronts preserved sherman us and uk forces also deployed vehicles designed for close support role but these were conventional tanks whose only significant modification was the replacement of the main gun with howitzer two versions of the american sherman tank were armed with the mm howitzer the and the these were designated assault guns in us usage of the term the scott based on the chassis of the stuart light tank was also an assault cannon and carried mm short howitzer the churchill centaur and cromwell tanks were all produced in versions armed with mm howitzers the churchill mark and mark viii the centaur mark iv and the cromwell mark vi earlier british tanks such as the crusader cruiser tank and the matilda ii infantry tank were produced in versions armed with the inch howitzer the first versions of the churchill tank also had this gun in hull mounting american tank destroyer units were often used in the assault gun role for infantry support the avre version of the churchill tank was armed with spigot mortar that fired he filled projectile nicknamed the flying dustbin its task was to attack fortified positions such as bunkers at close range see hobart funnies post war use in the post wwii era vehicles fitting into an assault gun category were developed as light weight air deployable direct fire weapon for use with airborne troops those weapons were either based on jeeps or small tracked vehicles and the airborne troops thus always fought at distinct disadvantage in
