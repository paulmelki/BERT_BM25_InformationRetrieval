over their objection to parliament taxation policies and lack of colonial representation from their founding in the the colonies were largely left to govern themselves the cost of victory in the to french and indian war and to seven years war left the british government deeply in debt attempts to have the colonies pay for their own defense were vigorously resisted the stamp act and townshend acts provoked colonial opposition and unrest leading to the boston massacre and boston tea party when parliament imposed the intolerable acts upon massachusetts twelve colonies sent delegates to the first continental congress to draft petition to the king and organize boycott of british goods fighting broke out on april the british garrison at boston was harassed by massachusetts militia at

campaign captured the city but the british lost the battles of saratoga in october at valley forge during the winter of prussian emigrant general friedrich wilhelm von steuben trained the continental army with system of progressive training french foreign minister vergennes saw the war as way to create an america economically and militarily dependent on france not britain although talks on formal alliance began in late they proceeded slowly until patriot victory at saratoga in october fears congress might come to an early settlement with britain resulted in france and the united states signing two treaties in february the first was commercial treaty the second treaty of alliance in return for french guarantee of american independence congress agreed to join the war against britain and defend the french west indies although spain refused to join the franco american alliance in the treaty of aranjuez they agreed to support france in its global war with britain hoping to regain losses incurred in in other fronts in north america governor of spanish louisiana bernardo gálvez routed british forces from louisiana the spanish along with american privateers supplied the american

french and indian war and the wider conflict known as the seven years war ended with the peace of paris which expelled france from north america at the same time the british rescinded provisions of colonial charters claiming to extend from the atlantic to the pacific the mississippi river became the dividing line between british and spanish possessions in the americas with free navigation on it to the open sea more american territory changed hands in than any settlement before or after destabilising existing alliances and trade networks and leading to conflict between settlers and american indians the proclamation line of was intended to refocus colonial expansion north into nova scotia or south into florida while separating american indians and colonials by restricting settlement in the west both sides agreed with the principle but disagreed on where to set the border keeping the peace required garrisons of regular troops along the frontier and led to disputes with the colonial legislatures over who should bear the expense taxation and legislation th print of the boston tea party although directly administered by the crown acting through local governor the colonies were largely governed by native born property owners while external affairs were managed by london colonial militia were funded locally but with the ending of the french threat in the legislatures expected less taxation not more at the same time the huge costs of the seven years war meant parliament expected the colonies to fund their own defense the outcome was series of disputes as to how these expenses should be paid the to grenville ministry began by instructing the royal navy to clamp down on smuggled goods and enforce customs duties levied in american ports the most important was the molasses act routinely ignored prior to it had significant economic impact since of new england rum exports were manufactured from imported molasses these measures were followed by the sugar act
