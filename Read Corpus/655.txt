pearl is one of the greatest allegories from the high middle ages as literary device an allegory is narrative in which character place or event is used to deliver broader message about real world issues and occurrences authors have used allegory throughout history in all forms of art to illustrate or convey complex ideas and concepts in ways that are comprehensible or striking to its viewers
