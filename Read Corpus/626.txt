acetylene systematic name ethyne is the chemical compound with the formula it is hydrocarbon and the simplest alkyne this colorless gas lower hydrocarbons are generally gaseous in nature is widely used as fuel and chemical building block it is unstable in its pure form and thus is usually handled as solution pure acetylene is odorless but commercial grades usually have marked odor due to impurities as an alkyne acetylene is unsaturated because its two carbon atoms are bonded together in triple bond the carbon carbon triple bond places all four atoms in the same straight line with cch bond angles of discovery acetylene was discovered in by edmund davy who identified it as new carburet of hydrogen it was an accidental discovery while attempting to isolate potassium metal by heating potassium carbonate with carbon at very high temperatures he produced residue of what is now known as potassium carbide which reacted with water to release the new gas it was rediscovered in by french chemist marcellin berthelot who coined the name acétylène berthelot empirical formula for acetylene as well as the alternative name quadricarbure hydrogène hydrogen quadricarbide were incorrect because chemists at that time used the wrong atomic mass for carbon instead of berthelot was able to prepare this gas by passing vapours of organic compounds methanol ethanol etc through red hot tube and collecting the effluent he also found that acetylene was formed by sparking electricity through mixed cyanogen and hydrogen gases berthelot later obtained acetylene directly by passing hydrogen between the poles of carbon arc commercially available acetylene gas may carry the odors from impurities divinyl sulfide and phosphine preparation since the acetylene has mainly been manufactured by the partial combustion of methane it is recovered side product in production of ethylene by cracking of hydrocarbons approximately tonnes were produced by this method in its presence in ethylene is usually undesirable because of its explosive character and its ability to poison ziegler natta catalysts it is selectively hydrogenated into ethylene usually using pd ag catalysts until the when oil supplanted coal as the chief source of reduced carbon acetylene and the aromatic fraction from coal tar was the main source of organic chemicals in the chemical industry it was prepared by the hydrolysis of calcium carbide reaction discovered by friedrich wöhler in and still familiar to students cac ca oh calcium carbide production requires extremely high temperatures necessitating the use of an electric arc furnace in the us this process was an important part of the late th century revolution in chemistry enabled by the massive hydroelectric power project at niagara falls from calcium carbide place some small lumps of calcium carbide about in ml distilling flask or in buchner flask of similar capacity and fit into the neck of the flask tall dropping funnel the stem of which has been drawn off to fine point the stem should pass well down below the side arm of the flask connect this side arm to wash bottle containing aqueous copper sulphate solution the tall droppingfunnel is thus required in order to give sufficient head of water in the funnel to force the acetylene through the wash bottle then fit to the wash bottle delivery tube which passes into pneumatic trough precisely fill the dropping funnel with water and allow the latter to fall drop by drop on to the calcium carbide acetylene is at once generated and on passing through the copper sulphate solution is freed from hydrogen sulphide etc allow the gas to escape from the delivery tube in the pneumatic trough until the issuing gas smells markedly of acetylene then collect sample of the gas in small test tube precisely as described for ethylene ignite the sample at burner placed as before at safe distance from the apparatus if the air in the apparatus has not yet been completely displaced the sample of gas will explode with sharp report if however the acetylene is free from air it will burn quietly with very smoky flame depositing carbon in the tube in marked contrast to the clear flame of burning ethylene bonding in terms of valence bond theory in each carbon atom the orbital hybridizes with one orbital thus forming an sp hybrid the other two orbitals remain unhybridized the two ends of the two sp hybrid orbital overlap to form strong valence bond between the carbons while on each of the other two ends hydrogen atoms attach also by bonds the two unchanged orbitals form pair of weaker bonds since acetylene is linear symmetrical molecule it possesses the point group physical properties changes of state at atmospheric pressure acetylene cannot exist as liquid and does not have melting point the triple point on the phase diagram corresponds to the melting point at the minimal pressure at which liquid acetylene can exist atm at temperatures below the triple point solid acetylene can change directly to the vapour gas by sublimation the sublimation point at atmospheric pressure is other at room temperature the solubility of acetylene in acetone is per kg for the same amount of dmf the solubility is at bar the solubility increases to and for acetone and dmf respectively these solvents are used in pressurized gas cylinders applications welding approximately of acetylene is supplied by the industrial gases industry for oxyacetylene gas welding and cutting due to the high temperature of the flame combustion of acetylene with oxygen produces flame of over releasing kj oxyacetylene is the hottest burning common fuel gas acetylene is the third hottest natural chemical flame after and cyanogen at oxy acetylene welding was popular welding process in previous decades the development and advantages of arc based welding processes have made oxy fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly on the other hand oxy acetylene welding equipment is quite versatile not only because the torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding as in certain artistic applications but also because it lends
