an architect is person who plans designs and oversees the construction of buildings to practice architecture means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings that have human occupancy or use as their principal purpose etymologically the term architect derives from the latin architectus which derives from the greek arkhi chief tekton builder chief builder the professional requirements for architects vary from place to place an architect decisions affect public safety and thus the architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and practicum or internship for practical experience to earn license to practice architecture practical technical and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction though the formal study of architecture in academic institutions has played pivotal role in the development of the profession as whole origins throughout ancient and medieval history most of the architectural design and construction was carried out by artisans such as stone masons and carpenters rising to the role of master builder until modern times there was no clear distinction between architect and engineer in europe the titles architect and engineer were primarily geographical variations that referred to the same person often used interchangeably filippo brunelleschi is revered as one of the most inventive and gifted architects in history it is suggested that various developments in technology and mathematics allowed the development of the professional gentleman architect separate from the hands on craftsman paper was not used in europe for drawing until the th century but became increasingly available after pencils were used more often for drawing by the availability of both allowed pre construction drawings to be made by professionals concurrently the introduction of linear perspective and innovations such as the use of different projections to describe three dimensional building in two dimensions together with an increased understanding of dimensional accuracy helped building designers communicate their ideas however the development was gradual until the th century buildings continued to be designed and set out by craftsmen with the exception of high status projects architecture in most developed countries only those qualified with an appropriate license certification or registration with relevant body often governmental may legally practice architecture such licensure usually requires university degree successful completion of exams as well as training period representation of oneself as an architect through the use of terms and titles is restricted to licensed individuals by law although in general derivatives such as architectural designer are often not legally protected to practice architecture implies the ability to practice independently of supervision the term building design professional or design professional by contrast is much broader term that includes professionals who practice independently under an alternate profession such as engineering professionals or those who assist in the practice of architecture under the supervision of licensed architect such as intern architects in many places independent non licensed individuals may perform design services outside the professional restrictions such design houses and other smaller structures practice in the architectural profession technical and environmental knowledge design and construction management and an understanding of business are as important as design however the design is the driving force throughout the project and beyond an architect accepts commission from client the commission might involve preparing feasibility reports building audits the design of building or of several buildings structures and the spaces among them the architect participates in developing the requirements the client wants in the building throughout the project planning to occupancy the architect coordinates design team structural mechanical and electrical engineers and other specialists are hired by the client or the architect who must ensure that the work is coordinated to construct the design design role the architect once hired by client is responsible for creating design concept that both meets the requirements of that client and provides facility suitable to the required use the architect must meet with and question the client in order to ascertain all the requirements and nuances of the planned project often the full brief is not entirely clear at the beginning entailing degree of risk in the design undertaking the architect may make early proposals to the client which may rework the very terms of the brief the program or brief is essential to producing project that meets all the needs of the owner this then is guide for the architect in creating the design concept design proposal are generally expected to be both imaginative and pragmatic depending on the place time finance culture and available crafts and technology in which the design takes place the precise extent and nature of these expectations will vary foresight is prerequisite as designing buildings is very complex and demanding undertaking any design concept must at very early stage in its generation take into account great number of issues and variables which include qualities of space the end use and life cycle of these proposed spaces connections relations and aspects between spaces including how they are put together as well as the impact of proposals on the immediate and wider locality selection of appropriate materials and technology must be considered tested and reviewed at an early stage in the design to ensure there are no setbacks such as higher than expected costs which may occur later the site and its environs as well as the culture and history of the place will also influence the design the design must also countenance increasing concerns with environmental sustainability the architect may introduce intentionally or not to greater or lesser degrees aspects of mathematics and architecture new or current architectural theory or references to architectural history key part of the design is that the architect often consults with engineers surveyors and other specialists throughout the design ensuring that aspects such as the structural supports and air conditioning elements are coordinated in the scheme as whole the control and planning of construction costs are also part of these consultations coordination of the different aspects involves high degree of specialized communication including advanced computer technology such
