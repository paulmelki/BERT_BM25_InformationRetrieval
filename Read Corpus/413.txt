the aare or aar is tributary of the high rhine and the longest river that both rises and ends entirely within switzerland its total length from its source to its junction with the rhine comprises about during which distance it descends draining an area of almost entirely within switzerland and accounting for close to half the area of the country including all of central switzerland there are more than hydroelectric plants along the course of the aare the river name dates to at least the la tène period and it is attested as nantaror aare valley in the berne zinc tablet the name was latinized as arula arola araris course the the aare at innertkirchen inside the aare gorge the aare rises in the great aargletschers aare glaciers of the bernese alps in the canton of bern and west of the grimsel pass the and come together to form the lower aar glacier which is the main source of water for the grimselsee lake of grimsel the upper aar glacier feeds the oberaarsee which also flows into the grimselsee the aare leaves the grimselsee just to the east to the grimsel hospiz below the grimsel pass and then flows northwest through the haslital forming on the way the magnificent handegg waterfall past guttannen right after innertkirchen it is joined by its first major tributary the gamderwasser less than later the river carves through limestone ridge in the aare gorge it is here that the aare proves itself to be more than just river as it attracts thousands of tourists annually to the causeways through the gorge little past meiringen near brienz the river expands into lake brienz near the west end of the lake it indirectly receives its first important tributary the lütschine by the lake of brienz it then runs across the swampy plain of the bödeli swiss german diminutive for ground between interlaken and unterseen before flowing into lake thun near the west end of lake thun the river indirectly receives the waters of the kander which has just been joined by the simme by the lake of thun lake thun marks the head of navigation on flowing out of the lake it passes through thun and then flows through the city of bern passing beneath eighteen bridges and around the steeply flanked peninsula on which the old city of berne is located the river soon changes its northwesterly flow for due westerly direction but after receiving the saane or la sarine it turns north until it nears aarberg there in one of the major swiss engineering feats of the th century the jura water correction the river which had previously rendered the countryside north of bern swampland through frequent flooding was diverted by the aare hagneck canal into the lac de bienne from the upper end of the lake at nidau the river issues through the nidau büren canal also called the aare canal and then runs east to büren the lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the alps and the former swamps have become fruitful plains they are known as the vegetable garden of switzerland from here the aare flows northeast for long distance past the ambassador town solothurn below which the grosse emme flows in on the right aarburg where it is joined by the wigger olten aarau near which is the junction with the suhre and wildegg where the seetal aabach falls in on the right short distance further below brugg it receives first the reuss its major tributary and shortly afterwards the limmat its second strongest tributary it now turns to north and soon becomes itself tributary of the rhine which it even surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite downstream from koblenz switzerland opposite waldshut in germany the rhine in turn empties into the north sea after crossing into the netherlands tributaries at the wasserschloss where
