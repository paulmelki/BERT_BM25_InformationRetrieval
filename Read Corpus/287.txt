in mathematics homogeneous relation on set is antisymmetric if there is no pair of distinct elements of each of which is related by to the other more formally is antisymmetric precisely if for all and in if with then must not hold or equivalently if and then the definition of antisymmetry says nothing about whether actually holds or not for any examples the divisibility relation on the natural numbers is an important example of an antisymmetric relation in this context antisymmetry means that the only way each of two numbers can be divisible by the other is if the two are in fact the same number equivalently if and are distinct and is factor of then cannot be factor of for example is divisible by but is not divisible by the usual order relation on the real numbers is antisymmetric if for two real numbers and both inequalities and hold then and must be equal similarly the subset order on the subsets of any given set is antisymmetric given two sets and if every element in also is in and every element in is also in then and must contain all the same elements and therefore be equal real life example of relation that is typically antisymmetric is paid the restaurant bill of understood as restricted to given occasion typically some people pay their own bills while others pay for their spouses or friends as long as no two people pay each other bills the relation is antisymmetric properties partial and total orders are antisymmetric by definition relation can be both symmetric and antisymmetric in this case it must be coreflexive and there are relations which are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric the preys on relation on biological species antisymmetry is different from asymmetry relation is asymmetric if and only if it is antisymmetric and irreflexive see also symmetry in mathematics references nlab antisymmetric relation
