the amstrad cpc short for colour personal computer is series of bit home computers produced by amstrad between and it was designed to compete in the mid home computer market dominated by the commodore and the sinclair zx spectrum where it successfully established itself primarily in the united kingdom france spain and the german speaking parts of europe the series spawned total of six distinct models the cpc cpc and cpc were highly successful competitors in the european home computer market the later plus and plus intended to prolong the system lifecycle with hardware updates were considerably less successful as was the attempt to repackage the plus hardware into game console as the gx the cpc models hardware is based on the zilog cpu complemented with either or kb of ram their computer in keyboard design prominently features an integrated storage device either compact cassette deck or inch floppy disk drive the main units were only sold bundled with either colour green screen or monochrome monitor that doubles as the main unit power supply additionally wide range of first and third party hardware extensions such as external disk drives printers and memory extensions was available the cpc series was pitched against other home computers primarily used to play video games and enjoyed strong supply of game software the comparatively low price for complete computer system with dedicated monitor its high resolution monochrome text and graphic capabilities and the possibility to run cp software also rendered the system attractive for business users which was reflected by wide selection of application software during its lifetime the cpc series sold approximately three million units the schneider cpc was schneider branded version of the amstrad cpc and very similar in appearance models the original range the philosophy behind the cpc series was twofold firstly the concept was of an all in one where the computer keyboard and its data storage device were combined in single unit and sold with its own dedicated display monitor most home computers at that time such as zx spectrum series commodore and bbc micro relied on the use of the domestic television set and separately connected tape recorder or disk drive in itself the all in one concept was not new having been seen before on business oriented machines and the commodore pet but in the home computer space it predated the macintosh by almost year secondly amstrad founder alan sugar wanted the machine to resemble real computer similar to what someone would see being used to check them in at the airport for their holidays and for the machine to not look like pregnant calculator in reference presumably to the sinclair zx and zx spectrum with their low cost membrane type keyboards paperboy on the cpc in cpc the cpc was one of the most successful computers in europe and sold more than two million units the cpc featured kb ram and an internal cassette deck it was introduced in june in the uk initial suggested retail prices for the cpc were gbp dm with green screen and gbp dm with colour monitor following the introduction of the cpc in late suggested retail prices for the cpc were cut by gbp dm in the plus replaced the cpc in the model line up and production of the cpc was discontinued cpc cpc main unit german schneider brand variant the cpc features kb ram and an internal inch floppy disk drive it was introduced in may in the uk initial suggested retail prices for the cpc were gbp dm with green screen and gbp dm with colour monitor after the successful release of the cpc consumers were constantly asking for two improvements more memory and an internal disk drive for amstrad the latter was easier to realise at the deliberately low key introduction of the cpc in may the machine was positioned not only as the lowest cost disk system but even the lowest cost cp machine in the amstrad cpc product range the cpc complemented the cpc which was neither discontinued nor reduced in price compared to the cpc the cpc main unit has been significantly redesigned not only to accommodate the floppy disk drive but also with redesigned keyboard area touted as ergonomic by amstrad promotional material the keyboard is noticeably tilted to the front with msx style cursor keys above the numeric keypad compared to the cpc multicoloured keyboard the cpc keys are kept in much quieter grey and pale blue colour scheme the back of the cpc main unit features the same connectors as the cpc with the exception of an additional power lead unlike the cpc cassette tape drive that could be powered off the main unit voltage the cpc floppy disk drive requires an additional voltage this voltage had to be separately supplied by an updated version of the bundled green screen colour monitor gt and ctm respectively the cpc was only produced for approximately six months in late when the cpc was introduced in europe amstrad decided not to keep three models in the line up and production of the cpc was discontinued cpc cpc motherboard the cpc features kb ram and an internal inch floppy disk drive aside from various hardware and firmware improvements one of the cpc most prominent features is the compatibility with the cp operating system that rendered it attractive for business uses the cpc was released in august and initially only sold in the us imported and distributed by indescomp inc of chicago it was the first amstrad product to be sold in the united states market that at the time was traditionally hostile towards european computer manufacturers by the end of it arrived in europe and replaced the cpc in the cpc model line up initial suggested retail prices for the cpc were us dm with green screen and us dm with colour monitor in the plus
