or is the first letter and the first vowel letter of the modern english alphabet and the iso basic latin alphabet its name in english is pronounced plural aes it is similar in shape to the ancient greek letter alpha from which it derives the uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of triangle crossed in the middle by horizontal bar the lowercase version can be written in two forms the double storey and single storey the latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it especially fonts intended to be read by children and is also found in italic type in the english

amodern roman modern italic amodern italic modern script amodern script when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for letter to represent the glottal stop the consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel and called it by the similar name of alpha in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the th century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages including english typographic variants different glyphs of the lowercase letter during roman times there were many variant forms of the letter first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent media there was also cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces due to the perishable nature of these surfaces there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles the known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial typographic variants include double storey and single storey at the end of the roman empire th century ad several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular or anglo irish semi uncial or anglo saxon majuscule of great britain by the th century the caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press this form was derived through combining of prior forms th century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today these variants the italic and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version the italic form also called script is used in most current handwriting and consists of circle and vertical stroke this slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers the roman form is used in most printed material it consists of small loop with an arc over it both derive from the majuscule capital form in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown many fonts then made the right leg vertical in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form graphic designers refer to the italic and roman forms as single decker and double decker respectively italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of text from the rest set in roman type there are some other cases aside from italic type where script also called latin alpha is used in contrast with latin such as in the international phonetic alphabet use in writing systems px english in modern english orthography the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds the near open front unrounded vowel as in pad the open back unrounded vowel as in father which is closer to its original latin and greek sound the diphthong as in ace and major usually when is followed by one or occasionally two consonants and
