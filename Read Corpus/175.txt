an author is the creator or originator of any written work such as book or play and is also considered writer more broadly defined an author is the person who originated or gave existence to anything and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created legal significance of authorship typically the first owner of copyright is the person who created the work the author if more than one person created the work then case of joint authorship can be made provided some criteria are met in the copyright laws of various jurisdictions there is necessity for little flexibility regarding what constitutes authorship the united states copyright office for example defines copyright as form of protection provided by the laws of the united states title code to authors of original works of authorship holding the title of author over any literary dramatic musical artistic or certain other intellectual works gives rights to this person the owner of the copyright especially the exclusive right to engage in or authorize any production or distribution of their work any person or entity wishing to use intellectual property held under copyright must receive permission from the copyright holder to use this work and often will be asked to pay for the use of copyrighted material after fixed amount of time the copyright expires on intellectual work and it enters the public domain where it can be used without limit copyright laws in many jurisdictions mostly following the lead of the united states in which the entertainment and publishing industries have very strong lobbying power have been amended repeatedly since their inception to extend the length of this fixed period where the work is exclusively controlled by the copyright holder however copyright is merely the legal reassurance that one owns his her work technically someone owns their work from the time it created notable aspect of authorship emerges with copyright in that in many jurisdictions it can be passed down to another upon one death the person who inherits the copyright is not the author but enjoys the same legal benefits questions arise as to the application of copyright law how does it for example apply to the complex issue of fan fiction if the media agency responsible for the authorized production allows material from fans what is the limit before legal constraints from actors music and other considerations come into play additionally how does copyright apply to fan generated stories for books what powers do the original authors as well as the publishers have in regulating or even stopping the fan fiction this particular sort of case also illustrates how complex intellectual property law can be since such fiction may also involved trademark law for names of characters in media franchises likeness rights such as for actors or even entirely fictional entities fair use rights held by the public including the right to parody or satirize and many other interacting complications authors may portion out different rights they hold to different parties at different times and for different purposes or uses such as the right to adapt plot into film but only with different character names because the characters have already been optioned by another company for television series or video game an author may also not have rights when working under contract that they would otherwise have such as when creating work for hire hired to write city tour guide by municipal government that totally owns the copyright to the finished work or when writing material using intellectual property owned by others such as when writing novel or screenplay that is new installment in an already established media franchise philosophical views of the nature of authorship mark twain was prominent american author in multiple genres including fiction and journalism during the th century in literary theory critics find complications in the term author beyond what constitutes authorship in legal setting in the wake of postmodern literature critics such as roland barthes and michel foucault have examined the role and relevance of authorship to the meaning or interpretation of text barthes challenges the idea that text can be attributed to any single author he writes in his essay death of the author that it is language which speaks not the author the words and language of text itself determine and expose meaning for barthes and not someone possessing legal responsibility for the process of its production every line of written text is mere reflection of references from any of multitude of traditions or as barthes puts it the text is tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centres of culture it is never original with this the perspective of the author is removed from the text and the limits formerly imposed by the idea of one authorial voice one ultimate and universal meaning are destroyed the explanation and meaning of work does not have to be sought in the one who produced it as if it were always in the end through the more or less transparent allegory of the fiction the voice of single person the author confiding in us the psyche culture fanaticism of an author can be disregarded when interpreting text because the words are rich enough themselves with all of the traditions of language to expose meanings in written work without appealing to the celebrity of an author their tastes passions vices is to barthes to allow language to speak rather than author michel foucault argues in his essay what is an author that all authors are writers but not all writers are authors he states that private letter may have signatory it does not have an author for reader to assign the title of author upon any written work is to attribute certain standards upon the text which for foucault are working in conjunction with the idea of the author function foucault author function is the idea that an author exists only as function of written work part of its structure but not necessarily part of the interpretive process the
