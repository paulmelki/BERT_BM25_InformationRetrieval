arianism is nontrinitarian christological doctrine which holds that jesus christ is the son of god who was begotten by god the father and is distinct from the father therefore subordinate to him but the son is also god the son but not co eternal with god the father arian theology was first attributed to arius ad christian presbyter in alexandria of egypt the term arian is derived from the name arius and like the term christian it was not what they called themselves but rather term used by outsiders the nature of arius teachings and his supporters were opposed to the theological views held by homoousian christians regarding the nature of the trinity and the nature of christ the arian concept of christ is based on the belief that the son of god did not always exist but was begotten within time by god the father therefore jesus was not co eternal with god the father there was controversy between two interpretations of jesus divinity homoousianism and arianism based upon the theological orthodoxy of the time one trinitarian and the other nontrinitarian and both of them attempted to solve its respective theological dilemmas the former was formally affirmed by the first two ecumenical councils and in the past several centuries arianism continued to be viewed as the heresy or sect of arius as such all mainstream branches of christianity now consider arianism to be heterodox and heretical the trinitarianism or homoousianism viewpoint was promulgated by athanasius of alexandria who insisted that jesus god the son was same in being or same in essence with god the father arius stated if the father begat the son then he who was begotten had beginning in existence and from this it follows there was time when the son was not the ecumenical first council of nicaea of convened by emperor constantine to ensure church unity declared arianism to be heresy according to everett ferguson the great majority of christians had no clear views about the nature of the trinity and they did not understand what was at stake in the issues that surrounded it ten years later however constantine the great who was himself baptized by the arian bishop eusebius of nicomedia convened another gathering of church leaders at the regional first synod of tyre in attended by bishops to address various charges mounted against athanasius by his detractors such as murder illegal taxation sorcery and treason following his refusal to readmit arius into fellowship athanasius was exiled to trier in modern germany following his conviction at tyre of conspiracy and arius was effectively exonerated athanasius eventually returned to alexandria in after the deaths of both arius and constantine though arianism had spread athanasius and other trinitarian church leaders crusaded against arian theology and arius was again anathemised and condemned as heretic once more at the ecumenical first council of constantinople of attended by bishops the roman emperors constantius ii and valens were arians or semi arians as was the first king of italy odoacer and the lombards were also arians or semi arians until the th century visigothic spain was arian until many goths adopted arian beliefs upon their conversion to christianity the vandals actively spread arianism in north africa arianism is also used to refer to other nontrinitarian theological systems of the th century which regarded jesus christ the son of god the logos as either begotten creature of similar or different substance to that of the father but not identical as homoiousian and anomoeanism or as neither uncreated nor created in the sense other beings are created as in semi arianism origin byzantine icon depicting the first council of nicaea arius had been pupil of lucian of antioch at lucian private academy in antioch and inherited from him modified form of the teachings of paul of samosata he taught that god the father and the son of god did not always exist together eternally arianism taught that the logos was divine being begotten by god the father before the creation of the world made him medium through whom everything else was created and that the son of god is subordinate to god the father verse from proverbs was also used the lord created me at the beginning of his work proverbs therefore the son was rather the very first and the most perfect of god creatures and he was made god only by the father permission and power religiously emperor constantine the great summoned the first council of nicaea which defined the dogmatic fundaments of the christian religion through more accurately defining christian dogmas as an answer to the arian dilemma all the bishops who were there were in agreement with the major theological points of the proto orthodoxy since at that time all other forms of christianity had by this time already been displaced suppressed reformed or destroyed although the proto orthodox won the previous disputes due to the more accurate defining of orthodoxy they were vanquished with their own weapons ultimately being declared heretics not because they would have fought against ideas regarded as theologically correct but because their positions lacked the accuracy and refinement needed by the fusion of several contradictory theses accepted at the same time by later orthodox theologians according to bart ehrman that is why the trinity is such an absurd irrational concept controversy over arianism arose in the late rd century and persisted throughout most of the th century it involved most church members from simple believers priests and monks to bishops emperors and members of rome imperial family two roman emperors constantius ii and valens became arians or semi arians as did prominent gothic vandal and lombard warlords both before and after the fall of the western roman empire such deep controversy within the church during this period of its development could not have materialized without significant historical influences providing basis for the arian doctrines of the roughly three hundred bishops in attendance at the council of nicea two bishops did not
