the geography of antarctica is dominated by its south polar location and thus by ice the antarctic continent located in the earth southern hemisphere is centered asymmetrically around the south pole and largely south of the antarctic circle it is washed by the southern or antarctic ocean or depending on definition the southern pacific atlantic and indian oceans it has an area of more than million km some of antarctica is covered by the antarctic ice sheet the world largest ice sheet and also its largest reservoir of fresh water averaging at least km thick the ice is so massive that it has depressed the continental bedrock in some areas more than km below sea level subglacial lakes of liquid water also occur lake vostok ice shelves and rises populate the ice sheet on the periphery in september researchers at the national geospatial intelligence agency released high resolution terrain map detail down to the size of car and less in some areas of antarctica named the reference elevation model of antarctica rema regions the princesses astrid and ragnhild coasts the banzare sabrina and budd law dome coasts physically antarctica is divided in two by transantarctic mountains close to the neck between the ross sea and the weddell sea western antarctica and eastern antarctica correspond roughly to the eastern and western hemispheres relative to the greenwich meridian this usage has been regarded as eurocentric by some and the alternative terms lesser antarctica and greater antarctica respectively are sometimes preferred lesser antarctica is covered by the west antarctic ice sheet there has been some concern about this ice sheet because there is small chance that it will collapse if it does ocean levels would rise by few metres in very short period of time volcanoes volcanoes that occur underneath glacial ice sheets are known by the term glaciovolcanism or subglacial volcanoes an article published in claims that researchers from edinburgh university recently discovered new volcanoes below the antarctic ice sheet adding to the volcanoes that were already known as of today there have been possible volcanoes identified in west antarctica there is limited knowledge about west antarctic volcanoes due to the presence of the west antarctic ice sheet which heavily covers the west antarctic rift system likely hub for volcanic activity researchers find it difficult to properly identify volcanic activity due to the comprehensive ice covering east antarctica is significantly larger than west antarctica and similarly remains widely unexplored in terms of its volcanic potential while there are some indications that there is volcanic activity under the east antarctic ice sheet there is not significant amount of present information on the subject mount erebus is one of the most notable sites in the study of antarctic volcanism in that it is the southernmost historically active volcanic site on the planet deception island is another active antarctic volcano it is one of the most protected areas in the antarctic given its situation between the south shetland islands and the antarctic peninsula as the most active volcano in the antarctic peninsula it has been studied closely since its initial discovery in there are four volcanoes on the mainland of antarctica that are considered to be active on the basis of observed fumarolic activity or recent tephra deposits mount melbourne stratovolcano mount berlin stratovolcano mount kauffman stratovolcano and mount hampton volcanic caldera mount rittmann volcanic caldera several volcanoes on offshore islands have records of historic activity mount erebus stratovolcano on ross island with known eruptions and suspected eruption on the opposite side of the continent deception island volcanic caldera with known and suspected eruptions have been the most active buckle island in the balleny islands penguin island paulet island and lindenberg island are also considered to be active in the researchers of edinburgh university discovered underwater volcanoes under west antarctica glaciovolcanism the definition of glaciovolcanism is the interactions of magma with ice in all its forms including snow firn and any meltwater it defines special field of volcanic that is specifically centered around ice and ice melt this field of science is less than years old and thus continuously makes new discoveries glaciovolcanism is characterized by three kinds of eruptions sub glacial eruptions supraglacial volcanism and ice marginal volcanism the study of glaciovolcanism is vital to the understanding of ice sheet formation it is also valuable tool to predict volcanic hazards such as the ash hazard following the eruption in iceland marie byrd land the marie byrd land is an incredibly large portion of west antarctica consisting of the area below the antarctic peninsula the marie byrd land is large formation of volcanic rock characterized by exposed and subglacial volcanoes of the volcanoes are entirely covered by the antarctic ice sheet there have been no eruptions recorded from any of the volcanoes in this area however scientists believe that some of the volcanoes may be potentially active activity scientists and researchers debate whether or not the identified possible volcanoes are active or dormant it is very hard to definitively say given that many of these volcanic structures are buried underneath several kilometers of ice however ash layers within the west antarctic ice sheet as well as deformations in the ice surface indicate that the west antarctic rift system could be active and contain erupting volcanoes additionally seismic activity in the region hints at magma movement beneath the crust sign of volcanic activity despite this however there is not yet definitive evidence of presently active volcanoes subglacial volcanism is often characterized by ice melt and subglacial water though there are other sources of subglacial water such as geothermal heat it almost always is condition of volcanism scientists remain uncertain about the presence of water underneath the west antarctic ice sheet with some claiming to have found evidence indicating the existence conditions of formation in west antarctica marie byrd land volcanoes are typically composed of alkaline and basaltic lava sometimes the volcanoes are entirely basaltic in composition due to the geographic similarity of the marie byrd land
