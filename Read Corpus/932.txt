the seven sacraments by rogier van der weyden showing the sacrament of extreme unction or anointing of the sick anointing of the sick known also by other names is form of religious anointing or unction an older term with the same meaning for the benefit of sick person it is practiced by many christian churches and denominations anointing of the sick was customary practice in many civilizations including among the ancient greeks and early jewish communities the use of oil for healing purposes is referred to in the writings of hippocrates anointing of the sick should be distinguished from other religious anointings that occur in relation to other sacraments in particular baptism confirmation and ordination and also in the coronation of monarch names since the roman catholic church has used the name anointing of the sick both in the english translations issued by the holy see of its official documents in latin and in the english official documents of episcopal conferences it does not of course forbid the use of other names for example the more archaic term unction of the sick or the term extreme unction cardinal walter kasper used the latter term in his intervention at the assembly of the synod of bishops however the church declared that extreme unction may also and more fittingly be called anointing of the sick and has itself adopted the latter term while not outlawing the former this is to emphasize that the sacrament is available and recommended to all those suffering from any serious illness and to dispel the common misconception that it is exclusively for those at or very near the point of death extreme unction was the usual name for the sacrament in the west from the late twelfth century until and was thus used at the council of trent and in the catholic encyclopedia peter lombard died is the first writer known to have used the term which did not become the usual name in the west till towards the end of the twelfth century and never became current in the east the word extreme final indicated either that it was the last of the sacramental unctions after the anointings at baptism confirmation and if received holy orders or because at that time it was normally administered only when patient was in extremis other names used in the west include the unction or blessing of consecrated oil the unction of god and the office of the unction among some protestant bodies who do not consider it sacrament but instead as practice suggested rather than commanded by scripture it is called anointing with oil in the greek church the sacrament is called euchelaion greek εὐχέλαιον from εὐχή prayer and ἔλαιον oil other names are also used such as ἅγιον ἔλαιον holy oil ἡγιασμένον ἔλαιον consecrated oil and χρῖσις or χρῖσμα anointing the community of christ uses the term administration to the sick the term last rites refers to administration to dying person not only of this sacrament but also of penance and holy communion the last of which when administered in such circumstances is known as viaticum word whose original meaning in latin was provision for the journey the normal order of administration is first penance if the dying person is physically unable to confess absolution conditional on the existence of contrition is given next anointing finally viaticum if the person can receive it biblical texts the chief biblical text concerning the rite is james is any among you sick let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith will save the sick man and the lord will raise him up and if he has committed sins he will be forgiven rsv matthew luke and mark are also quoted in this context sacramental beliefs the roman catholic eastern orthodox and coptic and old catholic churches consider this anointing to be sacrament other christians too in particular lutherans anglicans and some protestant and other christian communities use rite of anointing the sick without necessarily classifying it as sacrament in the churches mentioned here by name the oil used called oil of the sick in both west and east is blessed

sick is one of the seven sacraments recognized by the catholic church and is associated with not only bodily healing but also forgiveness of sins only ordained priests can administer it and any priest may carry the holy oil with him so that in case of necessity he can administer the sacrament of anointing of the sick sacramental graces the catholic church sees the effects of the sacrament as
