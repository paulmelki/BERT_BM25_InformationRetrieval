in mathematics the axiom of regularity also known as the axiom of foundation is an axiom of zermelo fraenkel set theory that states that every non empty set contains an element that is disjoint from in first order logic the axiom reads the axiom of regularity together with the axiom of pairing implies that no set is an element of itself and that there is no infinite sequence an such that ai is an element of ai for all with the axiom of dependent choice which is weakened form of the axiom of choice this result can be reversed if there are no such infinite sequences then the axiom of regularity is true hence in this context the axiom of regularity is equivalent to the sentence that there are no downward infinite membership chains the axiom was introduced by it was adopted in formulation closer to the one found in contemporary textbooks by virtually all results in the branches of mathematics based on set theory hold even in the absence of regularity see chapter of however regularity makes some properties of ordinals easier to prove and it not only allows induction to be done on well ordered sets but also on proper classes that are well founded relational structures such as the lexicographical ordering on given the other axioms of zermelo fraenkel set theory the axiom of regularity is equivalent to the axiom of induction the axiom of induction tends to be used in place of the axiom of regularity in intuitionistic theories ones that do not accept the law of the excluded middle where the two axioms are not equivalent in addition to omitting the axiom of regularity non standard set theories have indeed postulated the existence of sets that are elements of themselves elementary implications of regularity no set is an element of itself let be set and apply the axiom of regularity to which is set by the axiom of pairing we see that there must be an element of which is disjoint from since the only element of is it must be that is disjoint from so since we cannot have by the definition of disjoint no infinite descending sequence of sets exists suppose to the contrary that there is function on the natural numbers with an element of for each define natural number the range of which can be seen to be set from the axiom schema of replacement applying the axiom of regularity to let be an element of which is disjoint from by the definition of must be for some natural number however we are given that contains which is also an element of so is in the intersection of and this contradicts the fact that they are disjoint sets since our supposition led to contradiction there must not be any such function the nonexistence of set containing itself can be seen as special case where the sequence is infinite and constant notice that this argument only applies to functions that can be represented as sets as opposed to undefinable classes the hereditarily finite sets vω satisfy the axiom of regularity and all other axioms of zfc except the axiom of infinity so if one forms non trivial ultrapower of vω then it will also satisfy the axiom of regularity the resulting model will contain elements called non standard natural numbers that satisfy the definition of natural numbers in that model but are not really natural numbers they are fake natural numbers which are larger than any actual natural number this model will contain infinite descending sequences of elements for example suppose is non standard natural number then and and so on for any actual natural number this is an unending descending sequence of elements but this sequence is not definable in the model and thus not set so no contradiction to regularity can be proved simpler set theoretic definition of the ordered pair the axiom of regularity enables defining the ordered pair as see ordered pair for specifics this definition eliminates one pair of braces from the canonical kuratowski definition every set has an ordinal rank this was actually the original form of the axiom in von neumann axiomatization suppose is any set let be the transitive closure of let be the subset of consisting of unranked sets if is empty then is ranked and we are done otherwise apply the axiom of regularity to to get an element of which is disjoint from since is in is unranked is subset of by the definition of transitive closure since is disjoint from every element of is ranked applying the axioms of replacement and union to combine the ranks of the elements of we get an ordinal rank for to wit this contradicts the conclusion that is unranked so the assumption that was non empty must be false and must have rank for every two sets only one can be an element of the other let and be sets then apply the axiom of regularity to the set which exists by the axiom of pairing we see there must be an element of which is also disjoint from it it must be either or by the definition of disjoint then we must have either is not an element of or vice versa the axiom of dependent choice and no infinite descending sequence of sets implies regularity let the non empty set be counter example to the axiom of regularity that is every element of has non empty intersection with we define binary relation on by which is entire by assumption thus by the axiom of dependent choice there is some sequence an in satisfying anran for all in as this is an infinite descending chain we arrive at contradiction and so no such exists regularity and the rest of zf axioms regularity was shown to be relatively consistent with the rest of zf by and meaning that if zf without regularity is consistent then zf with regularity is also consistent for his proof
