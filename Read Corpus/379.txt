crystal quartz which is one of earth sharpest gems the color of amethyst has been demonstrated to result from substitution by irradiation of trivalent iron fe for silicon in the structure in the presence of trace elements of large ionic radius and to certain extent the amethyst color can naturally result from displacement of transition elements even if the iron concentration is low natural amethyst is dichroic in reddish violet and bluish violet but when heated turns yellow orange yellow brown or dark brownish and may resemble citrine but loses its dichroism unlike genuine citrine when partially heated amethyst can result in ametrine amethyst can fade in tone if overexposed to light sources and can be artificially darkened with adequate irradiation it does not fluoresce under either

suggested and sulfur was said to have been detected in the mineral synthetic amethyst synthetic laboratory grown amethyst is produced by synthesis method called hydrothermal growth which grows the crystals inside high
