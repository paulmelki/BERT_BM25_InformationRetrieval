diamond and graphite are two allotropes of carbon pure forms of the same element that differ in crystalline structure allotropy or allotropism is the property of some chemical elements to exist in two or more different forms in the same physical state known as allotropes of the elements allotropes are different structural modifications of an element the atoms of the element are bonded together in different manner for example the allotropes of carbon include diamond the carbon atoms are bonded together in tetrahedral lattice arrangement graphite the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of hexagonal lattice graphene single sheets of graphite and fullerenes the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical tubular or ellipsoidal formations the term allotropy is used for elements only not for compounds the more general term used for any crystalline material is polymorphism allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same phase solid liquid or gas states the differences between these states would not alone constitute examples of allotropy for some elements allotropes have different molecular formulae despite difference in phase for example two allotropes of oxygen dioxygen and ozone can both exist in the solid liquid and gaseous states other elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different phases for example phosphorus has numerous solid allotropes which all revert to the same form when melted to the liquid state history the concept of allotropy was originally proposed in by the swedish scientist baron j√∂ns jakob berzelius the term is derived after the acceptance of avogadro hypothesis in it was understood that elements could exist as polyatomic molecules and two allotropes of oxygen were recognized as and in the early th century it was recognized that other cases such as carbon were due to differences in crystal structure by ostwald noted that the allotropy of elements is just special case of the phenomenon of polymorphism known for compounds and proposed that the terms allotrope and allotropy be abandoned and replaced by polymorph and polymorphism although many other chemists have repeated this advice iupac and most chemistry texts still favour the usage of allotrope and allotropy for elements only differences in properties of an element allotropes allotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours the change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures pressure light and temperature therefore the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions for instance iron changes from body centered cubic structure ferrite to face centered cubic structure austenite above and tin undergoes modification known as tin pest from metallic form to semiconductor form below as an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour ozone is much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen list of allotropes typically elements capable of variable coordination number and or oxidation states tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms another contributing factor is the ability of an element to catenate examples of allotropes include non metals element allotropes carbon diamond an extremely hard transparent crystal with the carbon atoms
