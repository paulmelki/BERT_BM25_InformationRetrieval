ajax battling hector engraving by john flaxman ajax or aias aíantos archaic is greek mythological hero the son of king telamon and periboea and the half brother of teucer he plays an important role and is portrayed as towering figure and warrior of great courage in homer iliad and in the epic cycle series of epic poems about the trojan war he is also referred to as telamonian ajax in etruscan recorded as aivas tlamunus greater ajax or ajax the great which distinguishes him from ajax son of oileus also known as ajax the lesser family ajax is the son of telamon who was the son of aeacus and grandson of zeus and his first wife periboea through his uncle peleus telamon brother he is the cousin of achilles and is the elder half brother of teucer his given name is derived from the root of to lament translating to one who laments mourner hesiod however includes story in the great eoiae that indicates ajax received his name when heracles prayed to zeus that son might be born to telemon and eriboea zeus sent an eagle aetos αετός as sign heracles then bade the parents call their son ajax after the eagle many illustrious athenians including cimon miltiades alcibiades and the historian thucydides traced their descent from ajax on an etruscan tomb dedicated to racvi satlnei in bologna th century bc there is an inscription that says aivastelmunsl which means family of telamonian ajax description the belvedere torso marble sculpture carved in the first century bc depicting ajax in homer iliad he is described as of great stature colossal frame and strongest of all the achaeans known as the bulwark of the achaeans he was trained by the centaur chiron who had trained ajax father telamon and achilles father peleus and would later die of an accidental wound inflicted by heracles whom he was at the time training at the same time as achilles he was described as fearless strong and powerful but also with very high level of combat intelligence ajax commands his army wielding huge shield made of seven cow hides with layer of bronze most notably ajax is not wounded in any of the battles described in the iliad and he is the only principal character on either side who does not receive substantial assistance from any of the gods except for agamemnon who take part in the battles although in book poseidon strikes ajax with his staff renewing his strength unlike diomedes agamemnon and achilles ajax appears as mainly defensive warrior instrumental in the defense of the greek camp and ships and that of patroclus body when the trojans are on the offensive he is often seen covering the retreat of the achaeans significantly while one of the deadliest heroes in the whole poem ajax has no aristeia depicting him on the offensive trojan war in the iliad ajax is notable for his abundant strength and courage seen particularly in two fights with hector in book ajax is chosen by lot to meet hector in duel which lasts most of whole day ajax at first gets the better of the encounter wounding hector with his spear and knocking him down with large stone but hector fights on until the heralds acting at the direction of zeus call draw with the two combatants exchanging gifts ajax giving hector purple sash and hector giving ajax his sharp sword the second fight between ajax and hector occurs when the latter breaks into the mycenaean camp and fights with the greeks among the ships in book ajax throws giant rock at hector which almost kills him in book hector is restored to his strength by apollo and returns to attack the ships ajax wielding an enormous spear as weapon and leaping from ship to ship holds off the trojan armies virtually single handedly in book hector and ajax duel once again hector then disarms ajax although ajax is not hurt and ajax is forced to retreat seeing that zeus is clearly favoring hector hector and the trojans succeed in burning one greek ship the culmination of an assault that almost finishes the war ajax is responsible for the death of many trojan lords including phorcys ajax often fought in tandem with his brother teucer known for his skill with the bow ajax would wield his magnificent shield as teucer stood behind picking off enemy trojans achilles was absent during these encounters because of his feud with agamemnon in book agamemnon and the other mycenaean chiefs send ajax odysseus and phoenix to the tent of achilles in an attempt to reconcile with the great warrior and induce him to return to the fight although ajax speaks earnestly and is well received he does not succeed in convincing achilles when patroclus is killed hector tries to steal his body ajax assisted by menelaus succeeds in fighting off the trojans and taking the body back with his chariot however the trojans have already stripped patroclus of achilles armor ajax prayer to zeus to remove the fog that has descended on the battle to allow them to fight or die in the light of day has become proverbial according to hyginus in total ajax killed people at troy death sorrowful ajax asmus jacob carstens as the iliad comes to close ajax and the majority of other greek warriors are alive and well when achilles dies killed by paris with help from apollo ajax and odysseus are the heroes who fight against the trojans to get the body and bury it with his companion patroclus ajax with his great shield and spear manages to recover the body and carry it to the ships while odysseus fights off the trojans after the burial each claims achilles magical armor which had been forged on mount olympus by the smith god hephaestus for himself as
