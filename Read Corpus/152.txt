an abjad is type of writing system in which in contrast to true alphabets each symbol or glyph stands for consonant in effect leaving it to readers to infer or otherwise supply an appropriate vowel the term is neologism introduced in by peter daniels other terms for the same concept include partial phonemic script segmentally linear defective phonographic script consonantary consonant writing and consonantal alphabet so called impure abjads represent vowels with either optional diacritics limited number of distinct vowel glyphs or both the name abjad is based on the arabic alphabet first in its original order four letters corresponding to to replace the more common terms consonantary and consonantal alphabet in describing the family of scripts classified as west semitic etymology the name abjad is derived from pronouncing the first letters of the arabic alphabet order in its original order this ordering matches that of the older phoenician hebrew and semitic proto alphabets specifically aleph bet gimel dalet terminology according to the formulations of peter daniels abjads differ from alphabets in that only consonants not vowels are represented among the basic graphemes abjads differ from abugidas another category defined by daniels in that in abjads the vowel sound is implied by phonology and where vowel marks exist for the system such as nikkud for hebrew and ḥarakāt for arabic their use is optional and not the dominant or literate form abugidas mark all vowels other than the inherent vowel with diacritic minor attachment to the letter or standalone glyph some abugidas use special symbol to suppress the inherent vowel so that the consonant alone can be properly represented in syllabary grapheme denotes complete syllable that is either lone vowel sound or combination of vowel sound with one or more consonant sounds the antagonism of abjad versus alphabet as it was formulated by daniels has been rejected by some other scholars because abjad is also used as term not only for the arabic numeral system but which is most important in terms of historical grammatology also as term for the alphabetic device letter order of ancient northwest semitic scripts in opposition to the south arabian order this caused fatal effects on terminology in general and especially in ancient semitic philology also it suggests that consonantal alphabets in opposition to for instance the greek alphabet were not yet true alphabets and not yet entirely complete lacking something important to be fully working script system it has also been objected that as set of letters an alphabet is not the mirror of what should be there in language from phonological point of view rather it is the data stock of what provides maximum efficiency with least effort from semantic point of view origins specimen of proto sinaitic script containing phrase which may mean to baalat the line running from the upper left to lower right reads mt bclt the first abjad to gain widespread usage was the phoenician abjad unlike other contemporary scripts such as cuneiform and egyptian hieroglyphs the phoenician script consisted of only few dozen symbols this made the script easy to learn and seafaring phoenician merchants took the script throughout the then known world the phoenician abjad was radical simplification of phonetic writing since hieroglyphics required the writer to pick hieroglyph starting with the same sound that the writer wanted to write in order to write phonetically much as man yōgana chinese characters used solely for phonetic use was used to represent japanese phonetically before the invention of kana phoenician gave rise to number of new writing systems including the widely used aramaic abjad and the greek alphabet the greek alphabet evolved into the modern western alphabets such as latin and cyrillic while aramaic became the ancestor of many modern abjads and abugidas of asia impure abjads al ʻarabiyya meaning arabic an example of the arabic script which is an impure abjad impure abjads have characters for some vowels optional vowel diacritics or both the term pure abjad refers to scripts entirely lacking in vowel indicators however most modern abjads such as arabic hebrew aramaic and pahlavi are impure abjadsthat is they also contain symbols for some of the vowel phonemes although the said non diacritic vowel letters are also used to write certain consonants particularly approximants that sound similar to long vowels pure abjad is exemplified perhaps by very early forms of ancient phoenician though at some point at least by the th century bc it and most of the contemporary semitic abjads had begun to overload few of the consonant symbols with secondary function as vowel markers called matres lectionis this practice was at first rare and limited in scope but became increasingly common and more developed in later times addition of vowels in the th century bc the greeks adapted the phoenician script for use in their own language the phonetic structure of the greek language created too many ambiguities when vowels went unrepresented so the script was modified they did not need letters for the guttural sounds represented by aleph he heth or ayin so these symbols were assigned vocalic values the letters waw and yod were also adapted into vowel signs along with he these were already used as matres lectionis in phoenician the major innovation of greek was to dedicate these symbols exclusively and unambiguously to vowel sounds that could be combined arbitrarily with consonants as opposed to syllabaries such as linear which usually have vowel symbols but cannot combine them with consonants to form arbitrary syllables abugidas developed along slightly different route the basic consonantal symbol was considered to have an inherent vowel sound hooks or short lines attached to various parts of the basic letter modify the vowel in this way the south arabian alphabet evolved into the ge ez alphabet between the th century bc and the th century ad similarly the brāhmī script developed around the rd century bc from the aramaic abjad it has been hypothesized the other major family of abugidas canadian aboriginal syllabics was initially developed
