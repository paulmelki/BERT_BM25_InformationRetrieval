europe contemporary western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of person personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems throughout most of its history astrology was considered scholarly tradition and was common in academic circles often in close relation with astronomy alchemy meteorology and medicine it was present in political circles and is mentioned in various works of literature from dante alighieri and geoffrey chaucer to william shakespeare lope de vega and calderón de la barca following the end of the th century and the wide scale adoption of the scientific method researchers have successfully challenged astrology on both theoretical and experimental grounds and have shown it to have no scientific validity or explanatory power astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing and common belief

being noted as early as years ago this was first step towards recording the moon influence upon tides and rivers and towards organising communal calendar farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of the constellations that appear in the different seasons and used the rising of particular star groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities by the rd millennium bce

astrological references are copies of texts made in the ancient world the venus tablet of ammisaduqa is thought to be compiled in babylon around bce scroll documenting an early use of electional astrology is doubtfully ascribed to the reign of the sumerian ruler gudea of lagash bce this describes how the gods revealed to him in dream the constellations that would be most favourable for the planned construction of temple however there is controversy about whether these were genuinely recorded at the time or merely ascribed to ancient rulers by posterity the oldest undisputed evidence of the use of astrology as an integrated system of knowledge is therefore attributed to the records of the first dynasty of mesopotamia bce this astrology had some parallels with hellenistic greek western astrology including the zodiac norming point near degrees in aries the trine aspect planetary exaltations and the dodekatemoria the twelve divisions of degrees each the babylonians viewed celestial events as possible signs rather than as causes
