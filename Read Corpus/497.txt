was born into the aristocratic governing class of mytilene the main city of lesbos where he was involved in political disputes and feuds biography alcaeus probably authentic lesbian coin has been preserved bearing upon the obverse profile head of alcaeus and upon the reverse profile head of pittacus this coin is said to have belonged to fulvius ursinus it passed through various hands and collections into the royal museum at paris and was engraved by the chevalier visconti easby smith pittacus the broad outlines of the poet life are well known he was born into the aristocratic warrior class that dominated mytilene the strongest city state on the island of lesbos and by the end of the seventh century bc the most influential of all the north aegean greek cities with strong navy and colonies securing its trade routes in the hellespont the city had long been ruled by kings born to the penthilid clan but during the poet life the penthilids were spent force and rival aristocrats and their factions contended with each other for supreme power alcaeus and his older brothers were passionately involved in the struggle but experienced little success their political adventures can be understood in terms of three tyrants who came and went in succession melanchrus he was overthrown sometime between bc and bc by faction that in addition to the brothers of alcaeus included pittacus later renowned as one of the seven sages of greece alcaeus at that time was too young to be actively involved myrsilus it is not known when he came to power but some verses by alcaeus frag indicate that the poet his brothers and pittacus made plans to overthrow him and that pittacus subsequently betrayed them alcaeus and his brothers fled into exile where the poet later wrote drinking song in celebration of the news of the tyrant death frag pittacus the dominant political figure of his time he was voted supreme power by the political assembly of mytilene and appears to have governed well bc even allowing alcaeus and his faction to return home in peace sometime before bc mytilene fought athens for control of sigeion and alcaeus was old enough to participate in the fighting according to the historian herodotus the poet threw away his shield to make good his escape from the victorious athenians then celebrated the occasion in poem that he later sent to his friend melanippus it is thought that alcaeus travelled widely during his years in exile including at least one visit to egypt his older brother antimenidas appears to have served as mercenary in the army of nebuchadnezzar ii and probably took part in the conquest of askelon alcaeus wrote verses in celebration of antimenides return including mention of his valour in slaying the larger opponent frag and he proudly describes the military hardware that adorned their family home frag sappho and alcaeus by lawrence alma tadema the walters art museum alcaeus was contemporary and countryman of sappho and since both poets composed for the entertainment of mytilenean friends they had many opportunities to associate with each other on quite regular basis such as at the kallisteia an annual festival celebrating the island federation under mytilene held at the messon referred to as temenos in frs and where sappho performed publicly with female choirs alcaeus reference to sappho in terms more typical of divinity as holy pure honey smiling sappho fr may owe its inspiration to her performances at the festival the lesbian or aeolic school of poetry reached in the songs of sappho and alcaeus that high point of brilliancy to which it never after wards approached and it was assumed by later greek critics and during the early centuries of the christian era that the two poets were in fact lovers theme which became favourite subject in art as in the urn pictured above poetry the poetic works of alcaeus were collected into ten books with elaborate commentaries by the alexandrian scholars aristophanes of byzantium and aristarchus of samothrace sometime in the rd century bc and yet his verses today exist only in fragmentary form varying in size from mere phrases such as wine window into man fr to entire groups of verses and stanzas such as those quoted below fr alexandrian scholars numbered him in their canonic nine one lyric poet per muse among these pindar was held by many ancient critics to be pre eminent but some gave precedence to alcaeus instead the canonic nine are traditionally divided into two groups with alcaeus sappho and anacreon being monodists or solo singers with the following characteristics they composed and performed personally for friends and associates on topics of immediate interest to them they wrote in their native dialects alcaeus and sappho in aeolic dialect anacreon in ionic they preferred quite short metrically simple stanzas or strophes which they re used in many poems hence the alcaic and sapphic stanzas named after the two poets who perfected them or possibly invented them the other six of the canonic nine composed verses for public occasions performed by choruses and professional singers and typically featuring complex metrical arrangements that were never reproduced in other verses however this division into two groups is considered by some modern scholars to be too simplistic and often it is practically impossible to know whether lyric composition was sung or recited or whether or not it was accompanied by musical instruments and dance even the private reflections of alcaeus ostensibly sung at dinner parties still retain public function critics often seek to understand alcaeus in comparison with sappho the
