in mathematics an associative algebra is an algebraic structure with compatible operations of addition multiplication assumed to be associative and scalar multiplication by elements in some field the addition and multiplication operations together give the structure of ring the addition and scalar multiplication operations together give the structure of vector space over in this article we will also use the term algebra to mean an associative algebra over the field standard first example of algebra is ring of square matrices over field with the usual matrix multiplication commutative algebra is an associative algebra that has commutative multiplication or equivalently an associative algebra that is also commutative ring in this article associative algebras are assumed to have multiplicative identity denoted they are sometimes called unital associative algebras for clarification in some areas of mathematics this assumption is not made and we will call such structures non unital associative algebras we will also assume that all rings are unital and all ring homomorphisms are unital many authors consider the more general concept of an associative algebra over commutative ring instead of field an algebra is an module with an associative bilinear binary operation which also contains multiplicative identity for examples of this concept if is any ring with center then is an associative algebra definition let be fixed commutative ring so could be field an associative algebra or more simply an algebra is an additive abelian group which has the structure of both ring and an module in such way that the scalar multiplication satisfies for all and furthermore is assumed to be unital which is to say it contains an element such that for all note that such an element is necessarily unique in other words is an module together with bilinear binary operation that is associative and has an identity if one drops the requirement for the associativity then one obtains non associative algebra if itself is commutative as ring then it is called commutative algebra as monoid object in the category of modules the definition is equivalent to saying that unital associative algebra is monoid object in mod the monoidal category of modules by definition ring is monoid object in the category of abelian groups thus the notion of an associative algebra is obtained by replacing the category of abelian groups with the category of modules pushing this idea further some authors have introduced generalized ring as monoid object in some other category that behaves like the category of modules indeed this allows one to avoid making an explicit reference to elements of an algebra for example the associativity can be expressed as follows by the universal property of tensor product of modules the multiplication the bilinear map corresponds to unique linear map the associativity then refers to the identity from ring homomorphisms an associative algebra amounts to ring homomorphism whose image lies in the center indeed starting with ring and ring homomorphism whose image lies in the center of we can make an algebra by defining for all and if is an algebra taking the same formula in turn defines ring homomorphism whose image lies in the center if ring is commutative then it equals its center so that commutative algebra can be defined simply as commutative ring together with commutative ring homomorphism the ring homomorphism appearing in the above is often called structure map in the commutative case one can consider the category whose objects are ring homomorphisms commutative algebras and whose morphisms are ring homomorphisms that are under is the coslice category of the category of commutative rings under the prime spectrum functor spec then determines an anti equivalence of this category to the category of affine schemes over spec how to weaken the commutativity assumption is subject matter of noncommutative algebraic geometry and more recently of derived algebraic geometry see also generic matrix ring algebra homomorphisms homomorphism between two algebras is an linear ring homomorphism explicitly is an associative algebra homomorphism if the class of all algebras together with algebra homomorphisms between them form category sometimes denoted alg the subcategory of commutative algebras can be characterized as the coslice category cring where cring is the category of commutative rings examples the most basic example is ring itself it is an algebra over its center or any subring lying in the center in particular any commutative ring is an algebra over any of its subrings other examples abound both from algebra and other fields of mathematics algebra any ring can be considered as algebra the unique ring homomorphism from to is determined by the fact that it must send to the identity in therefore rings and algebras are equivalent concepts in the same way that abelian groups and modules are equivalent any ring of characteristic is algebra in the same way given an module the endomorphism ring of denoted end is an algebra by defining any ring of matrices with coefficients in commutative ring forms an algebra under matrix addition and multiplication this coincides with the previous example when is finitely generated free module the square by matrices with entries from the field form an associative algebra over in particular the real matrices form an associative algebra useful in plane mapping the complex numbers form dimensional associative algebra over the real numbers the quaternions form dimensional associative algebra over the reals but not an algebra over the complex numbers since the complex numbers are not in the center of the quaternions the polynomials with real coefficients form an associative algebra over the reals every polynomial ring xn is commutative algebra in fact this is the free commutative algebra on the set xn the free algebra on set is an algebra of polynomials with coefficients in and noncommuting indeterminates taken from the set the tensor algebra of an module is naturally an algebra the same is true for quotients such as the exterior and symmetric algebras categorically speaking the functor that maps an module to its tensor algebra is left adjoint to the functor that sends an
