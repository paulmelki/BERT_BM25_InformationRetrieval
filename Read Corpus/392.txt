arachnophobia is an intense and rational fear of spiders and other arachnids such as scorpions treatment is typically by exposure therapy where the person is presented with pictures of spiders or the spiders themselves signs and symptoms people with arachnophobia tend to feel uneasy in any area they believe could harbour spiders or that has visible signs of their presence such as webs if arachnophobes see spider they may not enter the general vicinity until they have overcome the panic attack that is often associated with their phobia some people run away scream cry have emotional outbursts experience trouble breathing sweat have increased heart rates or even faint when they come in contact with an area near spiders or their webs in some extreme cases even picture or realistic drawing of spider can trigger intense fear reasons arachnophobia may be an exaggerated form of an instinctive response that helped early humans to survive or cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly european societies evolutionary an evolutionary reason for the phobia remains unresolved one view especially held in evolutionary psychology is that the presence of venomous spiders led to the evolution of fear of spiders or made acquisition of fear of spiders especially easy like all traits there is variability in the intensity of fear of spiders and those with more intense fears are classified as phobic being relatively small spiders do not fit the usual criterion for threat in the animal kingdom where size is factor but they can have medically significant venom and or cause skin irritation with their setae however phobia is an irrational fear as opposed to rational fear by ensuring that their surroundings were free from spiders arachnophobes would have had reduced risk of being bitten in ancestral environments giving them slight advantage over non arachnophobes in terms of survival however having fear of spiders in comparison to other potentially dangerous creatures present during homo sapiens environment of evolutionary adaptiveness may have had drawbacks in the handbook of the emotions psychologist arne Ã¶hman studied pairing an unconditioned stimulus with evolutionarily relevant fear response neutral stimuli snakes and spiders versus evolutionarily irrelevant fear response neutral stimuli mushrooms flowers and physical representation of polyhedra on human subjects and found that ophidiophobia and arachnophobia required only one pairing to develop conditioned response while mycophobia anthophobia and phobias of physical representations of polyhedra required multiple pairings and went extinct without continued conditioning while the conditioned ophidiophobia and arachnophobia were permanent psychiatrists isaac marks and randolph nesse and evolutionary biologist george williams have noted that people with systematically deficient responses to various adaptive phobias arachnophobia ophidiophobia basophobia are more temperamentally careless and more likely to end up in potentially fatal accidents and have proposed that such deficient phobia should be classified as hypophobia due to its selfish genetic consequences study found that people could detect images of spiders among images of flowers and mushrooms more quickly than they could detect images of flowers or mushrooms among images of spiders the researchers suggested that this was because fast response to spiders was more relevant to human evolution cultural an alternative view is that the dangers such as from spiders are overrated and not sufficient to influence evolution instead inheriting phobias would have restrictive and debilitating effects upon survival rather than being an aid for some communities such as in papua new guinea and cambodia spiders are included in traditional foods this suggests arachnophobia may be cultural rather than genetic trait treatments the fear of spiders can be treated by any of the general techniques suggested for specific phobias the first line of treatment is systematic desensitization also known as exposure therapy before engaging in systematic desensitization it is common to train the individual with arachnophobia in relaxation techniques which will help keep the patient calm systematic desensitization can be done in vivo with live spiders or by getting the individual to imagine situations involving spiders then modelling interaction with spiders for the person affected and eventually interacting with real spiders this technique can be effective in just one session although it generally takes more time recent advances in technology have enabled the use of virtual or augmented reality spiders for use in therapy these techniques have proven to be effective it has been suggested that exposure to short clips from the spider man movies may help to reduce an individual arachnophobia epidemiology arachnophobia affects to percent of the global population see also arachnophobia film
