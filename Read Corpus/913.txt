an audio file format is file format for storing digital audio data on computer system the bit layout of the audio data excluding metadata is called the audio coding format and can be uncompressed or compressed to reduce the file size often using lossy compression the data can be raw bitstream in an audio coding format but it is usually embedded in container format or an audio data format with defined storage layer format types it is important to distinguish between the audio coding format the container containing the raw audio data and an audio codec codec performs the encoding and decoding of the raw audio data while this encoded data is usually stored in container file although most audio file formats support only one type of audio coding data created with an audio coder multimedia container format as matroska or avi may support multiple types of audio and video data there are three major groups of audio file formats uncompressed audio formats such as wav aiff au or raw header less pcm formats with lossless compression such as flac monkey audio filename extension ape wavpack filename extension wv tta atrac advanced lossless alac filename extension mpeg sls mpeg als mpeg dst windows media audio lossless wma lossless and shorten shn formats with lossy compression such as opus mp vorbis musepack aac atrac and windows media audio lossy wma lossy uncompressed audio format one major uncompressed audio format lpcm is the same variety of pcm as used in compact disc digital audio and is the format most commonly accepted by low level audio apis and converter hardware although lpcm can be stored on computer as raw audio format it is usually stored in wav file on windows or in aiff file on macos the audio interchange file format aiff format is based on the interchange file format iff and the wav format is based on the similar resource interchange file format riff wav and aiff are designed to store wide variety of audio formats lossless and lossy they just add small metadata containing header before the audio data to declare the format of the audio data such as lpcm with particular sample rate bit depth endianness and number of channels since wav and aiff are widely supported and can store lpcm they are suitable file formats for storing and archiving an original recording bwf broadcast wave format is standard audio format created by the european broadcasting union as successor to wav among other enhancements bwf allows more robust metadata to be stored in the file see european broadcasting union specification of the broadcast wave format ebu technical document july this is the primary recording format used in many professional audio workstations in the television and film industry bwf files include standardized timestamp reference which allows for easy synchronization with separate picture element stand alone file based multi track recorders from aeta sound devices zaxcom hhb communications ltd fostex nagra aaton and tascam all use bwf as their preferred format lossless compressed audio format lossless compressed audio format stores data in less space without losing any information the original uncompressed data can be recreated from the compressed version uncompressed audio formats encode both sound and silence with the same number of bits per unit of time encoding an uncompressed minute of absolute silence produces file of the same size as encoding an uncompressed minute of music in lossless compressed format however the music would occupy smaller file than an uncompressed format and the silence would take up almost no space at all lossless compression formats include the common flac wavpack monkey audio alac apple lossless they provide compression ratio of about their files take up half the space of pcm development in lossless compression formats aims to reduce processing time while maintaining good compression ratio lossy compressed audio format lossy audio format enables even greater reductions in file size by removing some of the audio information and simplifying the data this of course results in reduction in audio quality but variety of techniques are used mainly by exploiting psychoacoustics to remove the parts of the sound that have the least effect on perceived quality and to minimize the amount of audible noise added during the process the popular mp format is probably the best known example but the aac format found on the itunes music store is also common most formats offer range of degrees of compression generally measured in bit rate the lower the rate the smaller the file and the more significant the quality loss list of formats file extension creation company description gp multimedia container format can contain proprietary formats as amr amr wb or amr wb but also some open formats aa audible amazon com low bitrate audiobook container format with drm containing audio encoded as either mp or the acelp speech codec aac the advanced audio coding format is based on the mpeg and mpeg standards aac files are usually adts or adif containers aax audible amazon com an audiobook format which is variable bitrate allowing high quality file encrypted with drm mpb contains aac or alac encoded audio in an mpeg container more details below act act is lossy adpcm kbit compressed audio format recorded by most chinese mp and mp players with recording function and voice recorders aiff apple standard uncompressed cd quality audio file format used by apple established years prior to microsoft uncompressed version wav alac apple an audio coding format developed by apple inc for lossless data compression of digital music amr amr nb audio used primarily for speech ape matthew ashland monkey audio lossless audio compression format au sun microsystems
