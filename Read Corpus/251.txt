armenia map of köppen climate classification zones satellite image of armenia armenia is landlocked country in western asia situated in the transcaucasus region between the black and caspian seas bordered on the north and east by georgia and azerbaijan and on the south and west by iran azerbaijan exclave nakhchivan and turkey the terrain is mostly mountainous and flat with fast flowing rivers and few forests but with many trees the climate is highland continental hot summers and cold winters the land rises to above sea level at mount aragats physical environment detailed map of armenia armenia is located in the southern caucasus the region southwest of russia between the black sea and the caspian sea modern armenia occupies part of historical armenia whose ancient centers were in the valley of the araks river and the region around lake van in turkey armenia is bordered on the north by georgia on the east by azerbaijan on the southeast by artsakh on the south by iran and on the west by turkey topography and drainage topography of armenia twenty five million years ago geological upheaval pushed up the earth crust to form the armenian plateau creating the complex topography of modern armenia the lesser caucasus range extends through northern armenia runs southeast between lake sevan and azerbaijan then passes roughly along the armenian azerbaijani border to iran thus situated the mountains make travel from north to south difficult geological turmoil continues in the form of devastating earthquakes which have plagued armenia in december the second largest city in the republic leninakan now gyumri was heavily damaged by massive quake that killed more than people about half of armenia area of approximately has an elevation of at least and only of the country lies below the lowest points are in the valleys of the araks river and the debed river in the far north which have elevations of respectively elevations in the lesser caucasus vary between to the southwest of the range is the armenian plateau which slopes southwestward toward the araks river on the turkish border the plateau is masked by intermediate mountain ranges and extinct volcanoes the largest of these mount aragats high is also the highest point in armenia most of the population lives in the western and northwestern parts of the country where the two major cities yerevan and gyumri are located the valleys of the debed and akstafa rivers form the chief routes into armenia from the north as they pass through the mountains lake sevan across at its widest point and long is by far the largest lake it lies above sea level on the plateau and is large other main lakes are arpi sev akna biogeographic regions of europe terrain is most rugged in the extreme southeast which is drained by the bargushat river and most moderate in the araks river valley to the extreme southwest most of armenia is drained by the araks or its tributary the hrazdan which flows from lake sevan the araks forms most of armenia border with turkey and iran while the zangezur mountains form the border between armenia southern province of syunik and azerbaijan adjacent nakhchivan autonomous republic armenian terrain climate temperatures in armenia generally depend upon elevation mountain formations block the moderating climatic influences of the mediterranean sea and the black sea creating wide seasonal variations with cold snowy winters and warm to hot summers on the armenian plateau the mean midwinter temperature is to and the mean midsummer temperature is to average precipitation ranges
