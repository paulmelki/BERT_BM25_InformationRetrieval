the adamic language is according to jewish tradition as recorded in the midrashim and some christians the language spoken by adam and possibly eve in the garden of eden it is variously interpreted as either the language used by god to address adam the divine language or the language invented by adam with which he named all things including eve as in the second genesis creation myth in the middle ages various jewish commentators held that adam spoke hebrew view also addressed in various ways by the late medieval italian poet dante alighieri in the early modern period some authors continued to discuss the possibility of an adamic language some continuing to hold to the idea that it was hebrew while others such as john locke were more skeptical more recently variety of mormon authors have expressed various opinions about the nature of the adamic language middle ages traditional jewish exegesis such as midrash genesis rabbah says that adam spoke the hebrew language because the names he gives eve isha book of genesis and chava genesis only make sense in hebrew by contrast kabbalism assumed an eternal torah which was not identical to the torah written in hebrew thus abraham abulafia in the th century assumed that the language spoken in paradise had been different from hebrew and rejected the claim then current also among christian authors that child left unexposed to linguistic stimulus would automatically begin to speak in hebrew umberto eco notes that genesis is ambiguous on whether the language of adam was preserved by adam descendants until the confusion of tongues genesis or if it began to evolve naturally even before babel genesis dante alighieri addresses the topic in his de vulgari eloquentia he argues that the adamic language is of divine origin and therefore unchangeable he also notes that according to genesis the first speech act is due to eve addressing the serpent and not to adam in his divine comedy however dante changes his view to another that treats the adamic language as the product of adam this had the consequence that it could no longer be regarded as immutable and hence hebrew could not be regarded as identical with the language of paradise dante concludes paradiso xxvi that hebrew is derivative of the language of adam in particular the chief hebrew name for god in scholastic tradition el must be derived of different adamic name for god which dante gives as early modern period proponents elizabethan scholar john dee makes references to an occult or angelic language recorded in his private journals and those of spirit medium edward kelley dee journals did not describe the language as enochian instead preferring angelical the celestial speech the language of angels the first language of god christ the holy language or adamical because according to dee angels it was used by adam in paradise to name all things the language was later dubbed enochian due to dee assertion that the biblical patriarch enoch had been the last human before dee and kelley to know the language dutch physician linguist and humanist johannes goropius becanus theorized in origines antwerpianae that antwerpian brabantic spoken in the region between the scheldt and meuse rivers was the original language spoken in paradise goropius believed that the most ancient language on earth would be the simplest language and that the simplest language would contain mostly short words since brabantic has higher number of short words than do latin greek and hebrew goropius reasoned that it was the older language his work influenced that of simon stevin who espoused similar ideas in uytspraeck van de weerdicheyt der duytse tael chapter in de beghinselen der weeghconst opponents by the th century the existence and nature of the alleged adamic language was commonly discussed amongst european jewish and christian mystics and primitive linguists robert boyle was skeptical that hebrew was the language best capable of describing the nature of things stating could never find that the hebrew names of animals mentioned in the beginning of genesis argued much clearer insight into their natures than did the names of the same or some other animals in greek or other languages john locke expressed similar skepticism in his an essay concerning human understanding modern period latter day saint movement joseph smith founder of the latter day saint movement in his revision of the bible declared the adamic language to have been pure and undefiled some latter day saints believe it to be the language of god glossolalia or speaking in tongues was commonplace in the early years of the movement and it was commonly believed that the language spoken during these incidents was the language of adam however this belief seems to have never been formally or officially adopted some other early latter day saint leaders including brigham young orson pratt and elizabeth ann whitney claimed to have received several words in the adamic language by revelation some latter day saints believe that the adamic language is the pure language spoken of by zephaniah and that it will be restored as the universal language of humankind at the end of the world apostle orson pratt declared that ahman part of the name of the settlement adam ondi ahman in daviess county missouri was the name of god in the adamic language an handwritten page from the joseph smith papers titled sample of the pure language and reportedly dictated by smith to br johnson asserts that the name of god is awmen the latter day saint endowment prayer circle once included use of the words pay lay ale these untranslated words are no longer used in temple ordinances and have been replaced by an english version god hear the words of my mouth some believe that the pay lay ale sentence is derived from the hebrew phrase pe le el mouth to god pay lay ale was identified in the temple ceremony as words from the pure adamic language other words thought by some latter day saints to
