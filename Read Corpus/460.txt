ahmed april november was the sultan of the ottoman empire from until his death in ahmed reign is noteworthy for marking the first breach in the ottoman tradition of royal fratricide henceforth ottoman rulers would no longer systematically execute their brothers upon accession to the throne he is also well known for his construction of the blue mosque one of the most famous mosques in turkey early life ahmed was probably born in april at the manisa palace manisa when his father şehzade mehmed was still prince and the governor of the sanjak of manisa his mother was handan sultan after his

mosque constantinople reign ahmed ascended the throne after his father death in at the age of thirteen when his powerful grandmother safiye sultan was still alive far lost uncle of ahmed yahya resented his accession to the throne and spent his life scheming to become sultan ahmed broke with the traditional fratricide following previous enthronements and did not order the execution of his brother mustafa instead mustafa was sent to live at the old palace at bayezit along with their grandmother safiye sultan this was most likely due to ahmed young age he had not yet demonstrated his ability to sire children and mustafa was then the only other candidate for the ottoman throne his brother execution would have endangered the dynasty and thus he was spared in the earlier part of his reign ahmed showed decision and vigor which were belied by his subsequent conduct the wars in hungary and persia which attended his accession terminated unfavourably for the empire its prestige was further tarnished in the treaty of zsitvatorok signed in whereby the annual tribute paid by austria was abolished following the crushing defeat in the ottoman safavid war against the neighbouring rivals safavid empire led by shah abbas the great georgia azerbaijan and other vast territories in the caucasus were ceded back to persia per the treaty of nasuh pasha in territories that had been

consequently being taken prisoner by the safavids the ottoman army was routed at urmia and had to flee firstly to van and then to diyarbekir here sinan pasha sparked rebellion by executing the
