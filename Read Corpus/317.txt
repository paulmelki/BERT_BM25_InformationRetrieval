acoustic theory is scientific field that relates to the description of sound waves it derives from fluid dynamics see acoustics for the engineering approach for sound waves of any magnitude of disturbance in velocity pressure and density we have in the case that the fluctuations in velocity density and pressure are small we can approximate these as where is the perturbed velocity of the fluid is the pressure of the fluid at rest is the perturbed pressure of the system as function of space and time is the density of the fluid at rest and is the variance in the density of the fluid over space and time in the case that the velocity is irrotational we then have the acoustic wave equation that describes the system where we have derivation for medium at rest starting with the continuity equation and the euler equation if we take small perturbations of constant pressure and density then the equations of the system are noting that the equilibrium pressures and densities are constant this simplifies to moving medium starting with we can have these equations work for moving medium by setting where is the constant velocity that the whole fluid is moving at before being disturbed equivalent to moving observer and is the fluid velocity in this case the equations look very similar note that setting returns the equations at rest linearized waves starting with the above given equations of motion for medium at rest let us now take to all be small quantities in the case that we keep terms to first order for the continuity equation we have the term going to this similarly applies for the density perturbation times the time derivative of the velocity moreover the spatial components of the material derivative go to we thus have upon rearranging the equilibrium density next given that our sound wave occurs in an ideal fluid the motion is adiabatic and then we can relate the small change in the pressure to the small change in the density by under this condition we see that we now have defining the speed of sound of the system everything becomes for irrotational fluids in the case that the fluid is irrotational that is we can then write and thus write our equations of motion as the second equation tells us that and the use of this equation in the continuity equation tells us that this simplifies to thus the velocity potential obeys the wave equation in the limit of small disturbances the boundary conditions required to solve for the potential come from the fact that the velocity of the fluid must be normal to the fixed surfaces of the system taking the time derivative of this wave equation and multiplying all sides by the unperturbed density and then using the fact that tells us that similarly we saw that thus we can multiply the above equation appropriately and see that thus the velocity potential pressure and density all obey the wave equation moreover we only need to solve one such equation to determine all other three in particular we have for moving medium again we can derive the small disturbance limit for sound waves in moving medium again starting with we can linearize these into for irrotational fluids in moving medium given that we saw that if we make the previous assumptions of the fluid being ideal and the velocity being irrotational then we have under these assumptions our linearized sound equations become importantly since is constant we have and then the second equation tells us that or just that now when we use this relation with the fact that alongside cancelling and rearranging terms we arrive at we can write this in familiar form as this differential equation must be solved with the appropriate boundary conditions note that setting returns us the wave equation regardless upon solving this equation for moving medium we then have see also acoustic attenuation sound fourier analysis references
