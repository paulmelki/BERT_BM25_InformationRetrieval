algol designated beta persei persei abbreviated beta per per known colloquially as the demon star is bright multiple star in the constellation of perseus and one of the first non nova variable stars to be discovered algol is three star system consisting of beta persei aa aa and ab in which the hot luminous primary persei aa and the larger but cooler and fainter persei aa regularly pass in front of each other causing eclipses thus algol magnitude is usually near constant at but regularly dips to every days during the roughly hour long partial eclipses the secondary eclipse when the brighter primary star occults the fainter secondary is very shallow and can only be detected algol gives its name to its class of eclipsing variable known as algol variables observation history chara interferometer image with milliarcsecond resolution in the near infrared band the elongated appearance of algol aa labelled and the round appearance of algol aa labelled are real but the form of algol ab labelled is an artifact an ancient egyptian calendar of lucky and unlucky days composed some years ago is claimed to be the oldest historical documentation of the discovery of algol the association of algol with demon like creature gorgon in the greek tradition ghoul in the arabic tradition suggests that its variability was known long before the th century but there is still no indisputable evidence for this the arabic astronomer al sufi said nothing about any variability of the star in his book of fixed stars published the variability of algol was noted in by italian astronomer geminiano montanari but the periodic nature of its variations in brightness was not recognized until more than century later when the british amateur astronomer john goodricke also proposed mechanism for the star variability in may he presented his findings to the royal society suggesting that the periodic variability was caused by dark body passing in front of the star or else that the star itself has darker region that is periodically turned toward the earth for his report he was awarded the copley medal in the harvard astronomer edward charles pickering presented evidence that algol was actually an eclipsing binary this was confirmed few years later in when the potsdam astronomer hermann carl vogel found periodic doppler shifts in the spectrum of algol inferring variations in the radial velocity of this binary system thus algol became one of the first known spectroscopic binaries joel stebbins at the university of illinois observatory used an early selenium cell photometer to produce the first ever photoelectric study of variable star the light curve revealed the second minimum and the reflection effect between the two stars some difficulties in explaining the observed spectroscopic features led to the conjecture that third star may be present in the system four decades later this conjecture was found to be correct observing algol eclipses in and date time october

persei aa every days days hours min therefore keep adding that much to each date and time to get the following eclipses for example the jan eclipse will yield consecutive eclipse times on jan then jan then jan etc all times approximate system chara interferometer in the near infrared band sorted according to orbital phase because some phases are poorly covered aa jumps at some points along its path interpolation of the orbit of aa around aa with focus on aa algol is multiple star system with three confirmed and two suspected stellar components from the point of view of the earth algol aa and algol aa form an eclipsing binary because their orbital plane contains the line of sight to the earth the eclipsing binary pair is separated by only astronomical units au from each other whereas the third star in the system algol ab is at an average distance of au from the pair and the mutual orbital period of the trio is earth days the total mass of the system is about solar masses and the mass ratios of aa aa and ab are about to to the three components of the bright triple star used to be and still sometimes are referred to as per and the washington double star catalog lists them as aa aa and ab with two very faint stars and about one arcmin distant further five faint stars are also listed as companions studies of algol led to the algol paradox in the theory of stellar evolution although components of binary star form at the same time and massive stars evolve much faster than the less massive stars the more massive component algol aa is still in the main sequence but the less massive algol aa is subgiant star at later evolutionary stage the paradox can be solved by mass transfer when the more massive star became subgiant it filled its roche lobe and most of the mass was transferred to the other star which is still in the main sequence in some binaries similar to algol gas flow can be seen the gas flow between the primary and secondary stars in algol has been imaged using doppler tomography this system also exhibits ray and radio wave flares the ray flares are thought to be caused by the magnetic fields of the and components interacting with the mass transfer the radio wave flares might be created by magnetic cycles similar to those of sunspots but because the magnetic fields of these stars are up to ten times stronger than the field of the sun these radio flares are more powerful and more persistent the secondary component was identified as the radio emitting source in algol using very long baseline interferometry by lestrade and co authors magnetic activity cycles in the active secondary component induce changes in its radius of gyration that have been linked to
