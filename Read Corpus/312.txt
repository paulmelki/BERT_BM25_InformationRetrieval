anglicanism is western christian tradition that has developed from the practices liturgy and identity of the church of england following the english reformation adherents of anglicanism are called anglicans they are also called episcopalians in some countries the majority of anglicans are members of national or regional ecclesiastical provinces of the international anglican communion which forms the third largest christian communion in the world after the roman catholic church and the eastern orthodox church they are in full communion with the see of canterbury and thus the archbishop of canterbury whom the communion refers to as its primus inter pares latin first among equals he calls the decennial lambeth conference chairs the meeting of primates and is the president of the anglican consultative council some churches that are not part of the anglican communion or recognised by it also call themselves anglican including those that are within the continuing anglican movement and anglican realignment anglicans base their christian faith on the bible traditions of the apostolic church apostolic succession historic episcopate and the writings of the church fathers anglicanism forms one of the branches of western christianity having definitively declared its independence from the holy see at the time of the elizabethan religious settlement many of the new anglican formularies of the mid th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary protestantism these reforms in the church of england were understood by one of those most responsible for them thomas cranmer the archbishop of canterbury and others as navigating middle way between two of the emerging protestant traditions namely lutheranism and calvinism in the first half of the th century the church of england and its associated church of ireland were presented by some anglican divines as comprising distinct christian tradition with theologies structures and forms of worship representing different kind of middle way or via media between protestantism and catholicism perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of anglican identity and expressed in the description of anglicanism as catholic and reformed the degree of distinction between protestant and catholic tendencies within the anglican tradition is routinely matter of debate both within specific anglican churches and throughout the anglican communion unique to anglicanism is the book of common prayer the collection of services in one book used for centuries the book is acknowledged as principal tie that binds the anglican communion together as liturgical rather than confessional tradition or one possessing magisterium as in the roman catholic church after the american revolution anglican congregations in the united states and british north america which would later form the basis for the modern country of canada were each reconstituted into autonomous churches with their own bishops and self governing structures these were known as the american episcopal church and the church of england in the dominion of canada through the expansion of the british empire and the activity of christian missions this model was adopted as the model for many newly formed churches especially in africa australasia and asia pacific in the th century the term anglicanism was coined to describe the common religious tradition of these churches as also that of the scottish episcopal church which though originating earlier within the church of scotland had come to be recognised as sharing this common identity terminology jesus christ supporting an english flag and staff in the crook of his right arm depicted in stained glass window in rochester cathedral kent the word anglican originates in phrase from the magna carta dated june meaning the anglican church shall be free adherents of anglicanism are called anglicans as an adjective anglican is used to describe the people institutions and churches as well as the liturgical traditions and theological concepts developed by the church of england as noun an anglican is member of church in the anglican communion the word is also used by followers of separated groups which have left the communion or have been founded separately from it although this is considered as misuse by the anglican communion the word anglicanism came into being in the th century the word originally referred only to the teachings and rites of christians throughout the world in communion with the see of canterbury but has come to sometimes be extended to any church following those traditions rather than actual membership in the modern anglican communion although the term anglican is found referring to the church of england as far back as the th century its use did not become general until the latter half of the th century in british parliamentary legislation referring to the english established church there is no need for description it is simply the church of england though the word protestant is used in many legal acts specifying the succession to the crown and qualifications for office when the union with ireland act created the united church of england and ireland it is specified that it shall be one protestant episcopal church thereby distinguishing its form of church government from the presbyterian polity that prevails in the church of scotland the word episcopal is preferred in the title of the episcopal church the province of the anglican communion covering the united states and the scottish episcopal church though the full name of the former is the protestant episcopal church of the united states of america elsewhere however the term anglican church came to be preferred as it distinguished these churches from others that maintain an episcopal polity definition anglicanism in its structures theology and forms of worship is commonly understood as distinct christian tradition representing middle ground between what are perceived to be the extremes of the claims of th century roman catholicism and the lutheran and reformed varieties of protestantism of that era as such it is often referred to as being via media or middle way between these traditions the faith of anglicans is founded in the scriptures and the gospels the traditions of the apostolic church the historical episcopate the first four ecumenical councils and the
