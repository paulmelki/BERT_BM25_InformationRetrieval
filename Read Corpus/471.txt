the so called mask of agamemnon which was discovered by heinrich schliemann in at mycenae now believed to pre date the legendary trojan war by years in greek mythology agamemnon agamémnōn was king of mycenae the son or grandson of king atreus and queen aerope of mycenae the brother of menelaus the husband of clytemnestra and the father of iphigenia electra or laodike λαοδίκη orestes and chrysothemis legends make him the king of mycenae or argos thought to be different names for the same area when menelaus wife helen was taken to troy by paris agamemnon commanded the united greek armed forces in the ensuing trojan war upon agamemnon return from troy he was killed according to the oldest surviving account odyssey by aegisthus the lover of his wife clytemnestra in old versions of the story the scene of the murder when it is specified is usually the house of aegisthus who has not taken up residence in agamemnon palace and it involves an ambush and the deaths of agamemnon followers as well or it seems to be an ancestral home of both agamemnon and aegisthus since agamemnon wife is stated to be there as well and agamemnon was said to have wept and kissed the land of his birth in some later versions clytemnestra herself does the killing or she and aegisthus act together killing agamemnon in his own home etymology his name in greek ἀγαμέμνων means very steadfast unbowed the word comes from ἀγαμέδμων from ἄγαν very much and μέδομαι think on early life agamemnon father atreus murdered the sons of his twin brother thyestes and fed them to thyestes after discovering thyestes adultery with his wife aerope thyestes fathered aegisthus with his own daughter pelopia and this son vowed gruesome revenge on atreus children aegisthus murdered atreus restored thyestes to the throne and took possession of the throne of mycenae and jointly ruled with his father during this period agamemnon and his brother menelaus took refuge with tyndareus king of sparta there they respectively married tyndareus daughters clytemnestra and helen agamemnon and clytemnestra had four children one son orestes and three daughters iphigenia electra and chrysothemis menelaus succeeded tyndareus in sparta while agamemnon with his brother assistance drove out aegisthus and thyestes to recover his father kingdom he extended his dominion by conquest and became the most powerful prince in greece agamemnon family history had been tarnished by murder incest and treachery consequences of the heinous crime perpetrated by his ancestor tantalus and then of curse placed upon pelops son of tantalus by myrtilus whom he had murdered thus misfortune hounded successive generations of the house of atreus until atoned by orestes in court of justice held jointly by humans and gods trojan war agamemnon gathered the reluctant greek forces to sail for troy preparing to depart from aulis port in boeotia agamemnon army incurred the wrath of the goddess artemis there are several reasons throughout myth for such wrath in aeschylus play agamemnon artemis is angry for the young men who will die at troy whereas in sophocles electra agamemnon has slain an animal sacred to artemis and subsequently boasted that he was artemis equal in hunting misfortunes including plague and lack of wind prevented the army from sailing finally the prophet calchas announced that the wrath of the goddess could only be propitiated by the sacrifice of agamemnon daughter iphigenia achilles surrender of briseis to agamemnon from the house of the tragic poet in pompeii fresco st century ad now in the naples national archaeological museum classical dramatizations differ on how willing either father or daughter was to this fate some include such trickery as claiming she was to be married to achilles but agamemnon did eventually sacrifice iphigenia her death appeased artemis and the greek army set out for troy several alternatives to the human sacrifice have been presented in greek mythology other sources such as iphigenia at aulis say that agamemnon was prepared to kill his daughter but that artemis accepted deer in her place and whisked her away to tauris in the crimean peninsula hesiod said she became the goddess hecate agamemnon was the commander in chief of the greeks during the trojan war during the fighting agamemnon killed antiphus and fifteen other trojan soldiers according to one source but in the iliad itself he shown to slaughter hundreds more in book during his aristea loosely translated to day of glory which is the most similar to achilles aristea in book they both are compared to lions and destructive fires in battle their hands are described as splattered with gore and invincible the trojans flee to the walls they both are appealed to by one of their victims they are both avoided by hector they both get wounded in the arm or hand and they both kill the one who wounded them even before his aristea agamemnon was considered to be one of the three best warriors on the greek side as proven when hector challenges any champion of the greek side to fight him in book and agamemnon along with diomedes and ajax the greater is one of the three most wished for to face him out of the nine strongest greek warriors who volunteered and after they reconciled even achilles admits in book that agamemnon is the best in strength and in throwing the spear that claim is further proven by the fact that agamemnon was the only major warrior on either side never to need the gods direct intervention to increase his strength or give him any unfair advantages in battle and yet he still caused incredible destruction almost on the scale of achilles the iliad tells the story about the quarrel between agamemnon and achilles in the final year of the war following one of the achaean army raids chryseis daughter of chryses one of apollo priests was taken as war prize by agamemnon chryses pleaded with agamemnon to free his daughter but was met with little success
