early monochrome analog receiver with large dials for volume control and channel selection and smaller ones for fine tuning brightness contrast and horizontal and vertical hold adjustments analog television is the original television technology that uses analog signals to transmit video and audio in an analog television broadcast the brightness colors and sound are represented by amplitude phase and frequency of an analog signal analog signals vary over continuous range of possible values which means that electronic noise and interference may be introduced thus with analog moderately weak signal becomes snowy and subject to interference in contrast picture quality from digital television dtv signal remains good until the signal level drops below threshold where reception is no longer possible or becomes intermittent analog television may be wireless terrestrial television and satellite television or can be distributed over cable network as cable television all broadcast television systems used analog signals before the arrival of dtv motivated by the lower bandwidth requirements of compressed digital signals since the digital television transition is proceeding in most countries of the world with different deadlines for the cessation of analog broadcasts development the earliest systems of analog television were mechanical television systems that used spinning disks with patterns of holes punched into the disc to scan an image similar disk reconstructed the image at the receiver synchronization of the receiver disc rotation was handled through sync pulses broadcast with the image information camera systems used similar spinning discs and required intensely bright illumination of the subject for the light detector to work the reproduced images from these mechanical systems were dim very low resolution and flickered severely analog television did not really begin as an industry until the development of the cathode ray tube crt which uses focused electron beam to trace lines across phosphor coated surface the electron beam could be swept across the screen much faster than any mechanical disc system allowing for more closely spaced scan lines and much higher image resolution also far less maintenance was required of an all electronic system compared to mechanical spinning disc system all electronic systems became popular with households after world war ii standards broadcasters of analog television encode their signal using different systems the official systems of transmission are named and these systems determine the number of scan lines frame rate channel width video bandwidth video audio separation and so on the colors in those systems are encoded with one of three color coding schemes ntsc pal or secam and then use rf modulation to modulate this signal onto very high frequency vhf or ultra high frequency uhf carrier wave each frame of television image is composed of scan lines drawn on the screen the lines are of varying brightness the whole set of lines is drawn quickly enough that the human eye perceives it as one image the process repeats and next sequential frame is displayed allowing the depiction of motion the analog television signal contains timing and synchronization information so that the receiver can reconstruct two dimensional moving image from one dimensional time varying signal the first commercial television systems were black and white the beginning of color television was in the practical television system needs to take luminance chrominance in color system synchronization horizontal and vertical and audio signals and broadcast them over radio transmission the transmission system must include means of television channel selection analog broadcast television systems come in variety of frame rates and resolutions further differences exist in the frequency and modulation of the audio carrier the monochrome combinations still existing in the are standardized by the international union itu as capital letters through when color television was introduced the hue and saturation information was added to the monochrome signals in way that black and white televisions ignore in this way backwards compatibility was achieved that concept is true for all analog television standards there were three standards for the way the additional color information can be encoded and transmitted the first was the american ntsc national television systems committee color television system the european australian pal phase alternation line rate and the french former soviet union secam séquentiel couleur avec mémoire standard were developed later and attempt to cure certain defects of the ntsc system pal color encoding is similar to the ntsc systems secam though uses different modulation approach than pal or ntsc in principle all three color encoding systems can be combined with any scan line frame rate combination therefore in order to describe given signal completely it necessary to quote the color system and the broadcast standard as capital letter for example the united states canada mexico and south korea use ntsc many of these transitioned or transitioning to digital japan uses ntsc discontinued in when japan transitioned to digital isdb the uk uses pal discontinued in when uk transitioned to digital dvb france uses secam discontinued in when france transitioned to digital dvb much of western europe and australia use pal many of these transitioned or transitioning to dvb as digital television standards most of eastern europe uses secam or pal and so on however not all of these possible combinations actually exist ntsc is currently only used with system even though there were experiments with ntsc line in the uk and ntsc line in part of south america pal is used with variety of line standards but also with the north american line standard accordingly named pal likewise secam is used with variety of line standards for this reason many people refer to any type signal as pal and to any signal as ntsc even when referring to digital signals for example on dvd video which does not contain any analog color encoding and thus no pal or ntsc signals at all even though this usage is common it is misleading as that is not the original meaning of the terms pal secam ntsc although number of different broadcast television systems were in use worldwide the same principles of operation apply in
