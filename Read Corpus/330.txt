visual representation of alpha decay alpha decay or decay is type of radioactive decay in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle helium nucleus and thereby transforms or decays into different atomic nucleus with mass number that is reduced by four and an atomic number that is reduced by two an alpha particle is identical to the nucleus of helium atom which consists of two protons and two neutrons it has charge of and mass of for example uranium decays to form thorium alpha particles have charge but as nuclear equation describes nuclear reaction without considering the electrons convention that does not imply that the nuclei necessarily occur in neutral atoms the charge is not usually shown alpha decay typically occurs in the heaviest nuclides theoretically it can occur only in nuclei somewhat heavier than nickel element where the overall binding energy per nucleon is no longer minimum and the nuclides are therefore unstable toward spontaneous fission type processes in practice this mode of decay has only been observed in nuclides considerably heavier than nickel with the lightest known alpha emitters being the lightest isotopes mass numbers of tellurium element exceptionally however beryllium decays to two alpha particles alpha decay is by far the most common form of cluster decay where the parent atom ejects defined daughter collection of nucleons leaving another defined product behind it is the most common form because of the combined extremely high nuclear binding energy and relatively small mass of the alpha particle like other cluster decays alpha decay is fundamentally quantum tunneling process unlike beta decay it is governed by the interplay between both the nuclear force and the electromagnetic force alpha particles have typical kinetic energy of mev or of their total energy tj kg and have speed of about or of the speed of light there is surprisingly small variation around this energy due to the heavy dependence of the half life of this process on the energy produced because of their relatively large mass the electric charge of and relatively low velocity alpha particles are very likely to interact with other atoms and lose their energy and their forward motion can be stopped by few centimeters of air approximately of the helium produced on earth is the result of the alpha decay of underground deposits of minerals containing uranium or thorium the helium is brought to the surface as by product of natural gas production history alpha particles were first described in the investigations of radioactivity by ernest rutherford in and by they were identified as he ions by george gamow had solved the theory of alpha decay via tunneling the alpha particle is trapped in potential well by the nucleus classically it is forbidden to escape but according to the then newly discovered principles of quantum mechanics it has tiny but non zero probability of tunneling through the barrier and appearing on the other side to escape the nucleus gamow solved model potential for the nucleus and derived from first principles relationship between the half life of the decay and the energy of the emission which had been previously discovered empirically and was known as the geiger nuttall law mechanism the nuclear force holding an atomic nucleus together is very strong in general much stronger than the repulsive electromagnetic forces between the protons however the nuclear force is also short range dropping quickly in strength beyond about femtometer while the electromagnetic force has an unlimited range the strength of the attractive nuclear force keeping nucleus together is thus proportional to the number of nucleons but the total disruptive electromagnetic force trying to break the nucleus apart is roughly proportional to the square of its atomic number nucleus with or more nucleons is so large that the strong nuclear force holding it together can just barely counterbalance the electromagnetic repulsion between the protons it contains alpha decay occurs in such nuclei as means of increasing stability by reducing size one curiosity is why alpha particles helium nuclei should be preferentially emitted as opposed to other particles like single proton or neutron or other atomic nuclei part of the reason is the high binding energy of the alpha particle which means that its mass is less than the sum of the masses of two protons and two neutrons this increases the disintegration energy computing the total disintegration energy given by the equation where is the initial mass of the nucleus is the mass of the nucleus after particle emission and is the mass of the emitted particle one finds that in certain cases it is positive and so alpha particle emission is possible whereas other decay modes would require energy to be added for example performing the calculation for uranium shows that alpha particle emission gives mev of energy while single proton emission would require mev most of the disintegration energy becomes the kinetic energy of the alpha particle itself although to maintain conservation of momentum part of the energy goes to the recoil of the nucleus itself see atomic recoil however since the mass numbers of most alpha emitting radioisotopes exceed far greater than the mass number of the alpha particle the fraction of the energy going to the recoil of the nucleus is generally quite small less than these disintegration energies however are substantially smaller than the potential barrier created by the nuclear force which prevents the alpha particle from escaping the energy needed to bring an alpha particle from infinity to point near the nucleus just outside the range of the nuclear force influence is generally in the range of about mev an alpha particle can be thought of as being inside potential barrier whose walls are mev above the potential at infinity however decay alpha particles only have energies of around to mev above the potential at infinity far less than the energy needed to escape quantum mechanics however allows the alpha particle to escape via quantum tunneling the quantum tunneling theory of alpha decay independently developed
