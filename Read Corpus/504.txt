demetrius ii nicator during his defeat at the battle of antioch bc in syria dying shortly after his reign marks the beginning of the disintegration of the seleucid realm with important eastern satrapies such as media being lost to the nascent parthian empire life origins and mission to rome alexander balas claimed to be the son of antiochus iv epiphanes and laodice iv and heir to the seleucid throne the ancient sources polybius and diodorus say that this claim was false and that he and his sister laodice vi were really natives of smyrna of humble origin modern scholars disagree about whether this is true or was propaganda put about by alexander opponents according to diodorus alexander was originally put forward as candidate for the seleucid throne by attalus ii of pergamum attalus had been disturbed by the seleucid king demetrius interference in cappadocia where he had dethroned king ariarathes boris chrubasik is sceptical noting that there is little subsequent evidence for attalid involvement with alexander however selene psoma has proposed that large set of coins minted in number of cities under attalid control in this period was produced by attalus ii in order to fund alexander bid for the kingship alexander and his sister were maintained in cilicia by heracleides former minister of antiochus iv and brother of timarchus an usurper in media who had been executed by the reigning king demetrius soter in bc heracleides brought alexander and his sister to rome where he presented alexander to the roman senate which recognised him as the legitimate seleucid king and agreed to support him in his bid to take the throne polybius mentions that attalus ii and demetrius also met with the senate at this time but does not state how this was connected to the recognition of alexander if at all war with demetrius bc seleucid era corresponding to bc after recruiting mercenaries alexander and heracleides departed to ephesus from there they invaded phoenicia by sea seizing ptolemais akko numismatic evidence shows that alexander had also gained control of seleucia pieria byblos beirut tyre by bc on this coinage alexander heavily advertised his claimed connection to antiochus iv depicting zeus nicephorus on his coinage as antiochus had done he also assumed the title of theopator divinely fathered which recalled antiochus epithet theos epiphanes god manifest the coinage also presented alexander balas in the guise of alexander the great with pronounced facial features and long flowing hair this was intended to emphasise his military prowess to his soldiers alexander and demetrius competed with another to win over jonathan apphus the leader of the ascendant faction in judaea jonathan was won over to alexander side by the grant of high position in the seleucid court and the high priesthood in jerusalem reinforced by jonathan hardened soldiers alexander fought decisive battle with demetrius in july bc in which demetrius was killed by autumn alexander kingship was recognised throughout the seleucid realm reign bc marriage commemorative of alexander balas and cleopatra thea alexander gained control of antioch at this time and his chancellor ammonius murdered all the courtiers of demetrius as well as his wife laodice and his eldest son antigonus ptolemy vi philometor of egypt entered into an alliance with alexander which was sealed by alexander marriage to his daughter cleopatra thea the wedding took place at ptolemais with ptolemy vi and jonathan apphus in attendance alexander took the opportunity to shower honours on jonathan whom he treated as his main agent in judaea the marriage was advertised by special coinage issue depicting the royal pair side by side only the second depiction of queen on seleucid coinage she is shown with divine attributes cornucopia and calathus and is depicted in front of the king some scholars have seen alexander as little more than ptolemaic puppet arguing that this coinage emphasises cleopatra dominance over him and that the chancellor ammonius was ptolemaic agent other scholars argue that the alliance was advertised as an important one but that the arguments for alexander subservience have been overstated being now master of the empire he is said to have abandoned himself to life of debauchery handing the administration of antioch over to two commanders hierax and diodotus this representation is partially product of his opponents propaganda but alexander is not recorded to have achieved anything in this years meanwhile the parthians took advantage of the unsettled situation to invade media the region had been lost to seleucid control by the middle of bc war with demetrius ii and death bc coin of demetrius ii nicator in early bc demetrius son demetrius ii returned to syria with force of cretan mercenaries led by man called lasthenes much of coele syria was lost to him immediately possibly as result of the succession of the regional commander jonathan attacked demetrius position from the south seizing jaffa and ashdod while alexander balas was occupied with revolt in cilicia in bc ptolemy vi of egypt invaded syria ostensibly in support of alexander balas in practice ptolemy intervention came at heavy cost with alexander permission he took control of all the seleucid cities along the coast including seleucia pieria he may also have started minting his own coinage in the syrian cities while he was at ptolemais akko however ptolemy switched sides according to josephus ptolemy discovered that alexander chancellor ammonius had been plotting to assassinate him but when he demanded that ammonius be punished alexander refused ptolemy remarried his cleopatra thea to demetrius ii and continued his march northward alexander commanders of antioch diodotus and hierax surrendered the city to ptolemy alexander returned from cilicia with his army but ptolemy vi and demetrius ii defeated his forces in
