antlia from ancient greek ἀντλία is constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere its name means pump in latin and greek it represents an air pump originally antlia pneumatica the constellation was established by nicolas louis de lacaille in the th century its non specific single word name already in limited use was preferred by john herschel then welcomed by the astronomic community which officially accepted this north of stars forming some of the sails of the ship argo navis the constellation vela antlia is completely visible from latitudes south of degrees north antlia is faint constellation its brightest star is alpha antliae an orange giant that is suspected variable star ranging between apparent magnitudes and antliae is an eclipsing binary star system changing in brightness as one star passes in front of the other sharing common envelope the stars are so close they will one day merge to form single star two star systems with known exoplanets hd and wasp lie within antlia as do ngc spiral galaxy and the antlia dwarf galaxy history johann bode depiction of antlia as double cylinder air pump the french astronomer nicolas louis de lacaille first described the constellation in french as la machine pneumatique the pneumatic machine in commemorating the air pump invented by the french physicist denis papin de lacaille had observed and catalogued almost southern stars during two year stay at the cape of good hope devising fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the southern celestial hemisphere not visible from europe he named all but one in honour of instruments that symbolised the age of enlightenment lacaille depicted antlia as single cylinder vacuum pump used in papin initial experiments while german astronomer johann bode chose the more advanced double cylinder version lacaille latinised the name to antlia pneumatica on his chart english astronomer john herschel proposed shrinking the name to one word in noting that lacaille himself had abbreviated his constellations thus on occasion this was universally adopted the international astronomical union adopted it as one of the modern constellations in although visible to the ancient greeks antlia stars were too faint to have been commonly recognised as figurative object or part of one in ancient asterisms the stars that now comprise antlia are in zone of the sky associated with the asterism old constellation argo navis the ship the argo of the argonauts in its latter centuries this due to its immense size was split into hull poop deck and sails by lacaille in ridpath reports that due to their faintness the stars of antlia did not make up part of the classical depiction of argo navis in non western astronomy chinese astronomers were able to view what is modern antlia from their latitudes and incorporated its stars into two different constellations several stars in the southern part of antlia were portion of dong ou which represented an area in southern china furthermore epsilon eta and theta antliae were incorporated into the celestial temple which also contained stars from modern pyxis characteristics covering square degrees and hence of the sky antlia ranks nd of the modern constellations by area its position in the southern celestial hemisphere means that the whole constellation is visible to observers south of hydra the sea snake runs along the length of its northern border while pyxis the compass vela the sails and centaurus the centaur line it to the west south and east respectively the three letter abbreviation for the constellation as adopted by the international astronomical union is ant the official constellation boundaries as set by belgian astronomer eugène delporte in are defined by polygon with an east side south side and ten other sides facing the two other cardinal compass points illustrated in infobox at top right in the equatorial coordinate system the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and while the declination coordinates are between and features the constellation antlia as seen by the naked eye stars lacaille gave nine stars bayer designations labelling them alpha through to theta combining two stars next to each other as zeta gould later added tenth iota antliae beta and gamma antliae now hr and hd ended up in the neighbouring constellation hydra once the constellation boundaries were delineated in within the constellation borders there are stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude the constellation two brightest stars alpha and epsilon antliae shine with reddish tinge alpha is an orange giant of spectral type iii that is suspected variable star ranging between apparent magnitudes and it is located light years away from earth estimated to be shining with around to times the luminosity of the sun it is most likely an ageing star that is brightening and on its way to becoming mira variable star having converted all its core fuel into carbon located light years from earth epsilon antliae is an evolved orange giant star of spectral type iiia that has swollen to have diameter about times that of the sun and luminosity of around suns it is slightly variable at the other end of antlia iota antliae is likewise an orange giant of spectral type iii it is light years distant located near alpha is delta antliae binary star light years distant from earth the primary is blue white main sequence star of spectral type and magnitude and the secondary is yellow white main sequence star of spectral type ve and magnitude zeta antliae is wide optical double star the brighter star zeta antliae is light years distant and has magnitude of though it is true binary star system composed of two white main sequence stars of magnitudes and that are separated by arcseconds the fainter star zeta antliae is light years distant and of magnitude eta antliae is another double composed of yellow white star of spectral type and magnitude with companion of magnitude theta antliae is likewise double most likely composed of an type main sequence star and yellow giant antliae is an eclipsing binary star system that
