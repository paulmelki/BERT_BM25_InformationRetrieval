alder trees by the beaulieu river at longwater lawn england alder is the common name of genus of flowering plants alnus belonging to the birch family betulaceae the genus comprises about species of monoecious trees and shrubs few reaching large size distributed throughout the north temperate zone with few species extending into central america as well as the northern and southern andes etymology the common name alder evolved from the old english word alor which in turn is derived from proto germanic root aliso the generic name alnus is the equivalent latin name which is also the source for alamo the spanish term for poplar description pollen with few exceptions alders are deciduous and the leaves are alternate simple and serrated the flowers are catkins with elongate male catkins on the same plant as shorter female catkins often before leaves appear they are mainly wind pollinated but also visited by bees to small extent these trees differ from the birches betula another genus in the family in that the female catkins are woody and do not disintegrate at maturity opening to release the seeds in similar manner to many conifer cones the largest species are red alder rubra on the west coast of north america and black alder glutinosa native to most of europe and widely introduced elsewhere both reaching over by contrast the widespread alnus alnobetula green alder is rarely more than tall shrub ecology alders are commonly found near streams rivers and wetlands sometimes where the prevalence of alders is particularly prominent these are called alder carrs in the pacific northwest of north america the white alder alnus rhombifolia unlike other northwest alders has an affinity for warm dry climates where it grows along watercourses such as along the lower columbia river east of the cascades and the snake river including hells canyon alder leaves and sometimes catkins are used as food by numerous butterflies and moths glutinosa and viridis are classed as environmental weeds in new zealand alder leaves and especially the roots are important to the ecosystem because they enrich the soil with nitrogen and other nutrients nitrogen fixation alder is particularly noted for its important symbiotic relationship with frankia alni an actinomycete filamentous nitrogen fixing bacterium this bacterium is found in root nodules which may be as large as human fist with many small lobes and light brown in colour the bacterium absorbs nitrogen from the air and makes it available to the tree alder in turn provides the bacterium with sugars which it produces through photosynthesis as result of this mutually beneficial relationship alder improves the fertility of the soil where it grows and as pioneer species it helps provide additional nitrogen for the successional species which follow samara like those of all alders because of its abundance red alder delivers large amounts of nitrogen to enrich forest soils red alder stands have been found to supply between and pounds of nitrogen per acre to kg per ha annually to the soil from alaska to oregon alnus viridis subsp sinuata sinuata sitka alder or slide alder pioneer fresh gravelly sites at the foot of retreating glaciers studies show that sitka alder more shrubby variety of alder adds nitrogen to the soil at an average of pounds per acre kg per ha per year helping convert the sterile glacial terrain to soil capable of supporting conifer forest alders are common among the first species to colonize disturbed areas from floods windstorms fires landslides etc alder groves themselves often serve as natural firebreaks since these broad leaved trees are much less flammable than conifers their foliage and leaf litter does not carry fire well and their thin bark is sufficiently resistant to protect them from light surface fires in addition the light weight of alder seeds per pound or million per kg allows for easy dispersal by the wind although it outgrows coastal douglas fir for the first years it is very shade intolerant and seldom lives more than years red alder is the pacific northwest largest alder and the most plentiful and commercially important broad leaved tree in the coastal northwest groves of red alder to inches to cm in diameter intermingle with young douglas fir forests west of the cascades attaining maximum height of to feet to in about sixty years and then lose vigor as heart rot sets in alders largely help create conditions favorable for giant conifers that replace them an alder root nodule gall jpg alt an alder root nodule whole root nodule sectioned alder root nodule

species have degree of edibility and may be rich in protein reported to have bitter and unpleasant taste they are more useful for survival purposes the wood of certain alder species is often used to smoke various food items such as coffee salmon and other seafood most of the pilings that form the foundation of venice were made from alder trees alder bark contains the anti inflammatory salicin which is metabolized into salicylic acid in the body some native american cultures use red alder bark alnus rubra to treat poison oak insect bites and skin irritations blackfeet indians have traditionally used an infusion made from the bark of red alder to treat lymphatic disorders and tuberculosis recent clinical studies have verified that red alder contains betulin and lupeol compounds shown to be effective against variety of tumors the inner bark of the alder as well as red osier dogwood or chokecherry is used by some indigenous peoples of the americas in smoking mixtures known as kinnikinnick to improve the taste of the bearberry leaf alder is illustrated in the coat of arms for the austrian town of grossarl electric guitars most notably those manufactured by the fender musical instruments corporation have been built with alder bodies since the alder is appreciated for its
