titus t√≠tos was an early christian missionary and church leader companion and disciple of paul the apostle mentioned in several of the pauline epistles including the epistle to titus he is believed to be gentile converted to christianity by paul and according to tradition he was consecrated as bishop of the island of crete titus brought fundraising letter from paul to corinth to collect for the poor in jerusalem later on crete titus appointed presbyters elders in every city and remained there into his old age dying in gortyna near the city of candia modern heraklion life titus was greek apparently from antioch who is said to have studied greek philosophy and poetry in his early years he seems to have been converted by paul whereupon he served as paul secretary and interpreter in the year titus accompanied paul to the council held at jerusalem on the subject of the mosaic rites towards the close of the year paul as he himself departed from asia sent titus from ephesus to corinth with full commission to remedy the fallout precipitated by timothy delivery of corinthians and paul painful visit particularly significant personal offense and challenge to paul authority by one unnamed individual during this journey titus served as the courier for what is commonly known as the severe letter pauline missive that has been lost but is referred to in corinthians after success on this mission titus journeyed north and met paul in macedonia there the apostle overjoyed by titus success wrote corinthians titus then returned to corinth with larger entourage carrying corinthians with him paul joined titus in corinth later from corinth paul then sent titus to organize the collections of alms for the christians at jerusalem titus was therefore troubleshooter peacemaker administrator and missionary early church tradition holds that paul after his release from his first imprisonment in rome stopped at the island of crete to preach due to the needs of other churches requiring his presence elsewhere he ordained his disciple titus as bishop of that island and left him to finish the work he had started chrysostom says that this is an indication of the esteem paul held for titus paul summoned titus from crete to join him at nicopolis in epirus later titus traveled to dalmatia the new testament does not record his death it has been argued that the name titus in corinthians and galatians is nothing more than an informal name used by timothy implied already by the fact that even though both are said to be long term close companions of paul they never appear in common scenes the theory proposes that number of passages cor cor and acts all refer to the same journey of single individual titus timothy timothy seems to dispute this by claiming that titus has gone to dalmatia the fact that paul made point of circumcising timothy but refused to circumcise titus would indicate that they are different men although certain manuscripts of galatians have been taken by marius victorinus for example to indicate that paul did circumcise titus veneration the feast day of titus was not included in the tridentine calendar when added in it was assigned to february in the catholic church assigned the feast to january so as to celebrate the two disciples of paul titus and timothy the day after the feast of the conversion of st paul the evangelical lutheran church in america celebrates these two together with silas on the same date the orthodox church commemorates him on august and on january his relics now consisting of only his skull are venerated in the church of st titus heraklion crete to which it was returned in after being removed to venice during the turkish occupation titus is the patron saint of the united states army chaplain corps the corps has established the order of titus award described by the department of defense references
