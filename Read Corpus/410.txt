animism from latin breath spirit life is the belief that objects places and creatures all possess distinct spiritual essence potentially animism perceives all things animals plants rocks rivers weather systems human handiwork and perhaps even words as animated and alive animism is used in the anthropology of religion as term for the belief system of many indigenous peoples especially in contrast to the relatively more recent development of organised religions although each culture has its own different mythologies and rituals animism is said to describe the most common foundational thread of indigenous peoples spiritual or supernatural perspectives the animistic perspective is so widely held and inherent to most indigenous peoples that they often do not even have word in their languages that corresponds to animism or even religion the term is an anthropological construct largely due to such ethnolinguistic and cultural discrepancies opinion has differed on whether animism refers to an ancestral mode of experience common to indigenous peoples around the world or to full fledged religion in its own right the currently accepted definition of animism was only developed in the late th century by sir edward tylor who formulated it as one of anthropology earliest concepts if not the first animism encompasses the beliefs that all material phenomena have agency that there exists no hard and fast distinction between the spiritual and physical or material world and that soul or spirit or sentience exists not only in humans but also in other animals plants rocks geographic features such as mountains or rivers or other entities of the natural environment water sprites vegetation deities tree sprites etc animism may further attribute life force to abstract concepts such as words true names or metaphors in mythology some members of the non tribal world also consider themselves animists such as author daniel quinn sculptor lawson oyekan and many contemporary pagans etymology sir edward tylor had initially wanted to describe the phenomenon as spiritualism but realised that such would cause confusion with the modern religion of spiritualism which was then prevalent across western nations he adopted the term animism from the writings of german scientist georg ernst stahl who had developed the term in as biological theory that souls formed the vital principle and that the normal phenomena of life and the abnormal phenomena of disease could be traced to spiritual causes the first known usage in english appeared in old animism earlier anthropological perspectives which have since been termed the old animism were concerned with knowledge on what is alive and what factors make something alive the old animism assumed that animists were individuals who were unable to understand the difference between persons and things critics of the old animism have accused it of preserving colonialist and dualist worldviews and rhetoric edward tylor definition edward tylor developed animism as an anthropological theory the idea of animism was developed by anthropologist sir edward tylor through his book primitive culture in which he defined it as the general doctrine of souls and other spiritual beings in general according to tylor animism often includes an idea of pervading life and will in nature belief that natural objects other than humans have souls this formulation was little different from that proposed by auguste comte as fetishism but the terms now have distinct meanings for tylor animism represented the earliest form of religion being situated within an evolutionary framework of religion that has developed in stages and which will ultimately lead to humanity rejecting religion altogether in favor of scientific rationality thus for tylor animism was fundamentally seen as mistake basic error from which all religion grew he did not believe that animism was inherently illogical but he suggested that it arose from early humans dreams and visions and thus was rational system however it was based on erroneous unscientific observations about the nature of reality stringer notes that his reading of primitive culture led him to believe that tylor was far more sympathetic in regard to primitive populations than many of his contemporaries and that tylor expressed no belief that there was any difference between the intellectual capabilities of savage people and westerners the idea that there had once been one universal form of primitive religion whether labeled animism totemism or shamanism has been dismissed as unsophisticated and erroneous by archaeologist timothy insoll who stated that it removes complexity precondition of religion now in all its variants social evolutionist conceptions tylor definition of animism was part of growing international debate on the nature of primitive society by lawyers theologians and philologists the debate defined the field of research of new science anthropology by the end of the th century an orthodoxy on primitive society had emerged but few anthropologists still would accept that definition the th century armchair anthropologists argued primitive society an evolutionary category was ordered by kinship and divided into exogamous descent groups related by series of marriage exchanges their religion was animism the belief that natural species and objects had souls with the development of private property the descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state these rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of developed religions according to tylor the more scientifically advanced society became the fewer members of that society believed in animism however any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits to tylor represented survivals of the original animism of early humanity confounding animism with totemism in three years after tylor proposed his definition of animism edinburgh lawyer john ferguson mclennan argued that the animistic thinking evident in fetishism gave rise to religion he named totemism primitive people believed he argued that they were descended from the same species as their totemic animal subsequent debate by the armchair anthropologists including bachofen Ã©mile durkheim and sigmund freud remained focused on totemism rather than animism with few directly challenging tylor definition anthropologists have commonly avoided the issue of animism and even the term itself rather than revisit this prevalent notion in light of their new
