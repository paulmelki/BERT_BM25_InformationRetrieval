aphrodite is an ancient greek goddess associated with love beauty pleasure passion and procreation she was syncretized with the roman goddess aphrodite major symbols include myrtles roses doves sparrows and swans the cult of aphrodite was largely derived from that of the phoenician goddess astarte cognate of the east semitic goddess ishtar whose cult was based on the sumerian cult of inanna aphrodite main cult centers were cythera cyprus corinth and athens her main festival was the aphrodisia which was celebrated annually in midsummer in laconia aphrodite was worshipped as warrior goddess she was also the patron goddess of prostitutes an association which led early scholars to propose the concept of sacred prostitution in greco roman culture an idea which is now generally seen as erroneous in hesiod theogony aphrodite is born off the coast of cythera from the foam produced by uranus genitals which his son cronus has severed and thrown into the sea in homer iliad however she is the daughter of zeus and dione plato in his symposium asserts that these two origins actually belong to separate entities aphrodite ourania transcendent heavenly aphrodite and aphrodite pandemos aphrodite common to all the people aphrodite had many other epithets each emphasizing different aspect of the same goddess or used by different local cult thus she was also known as cytherea lady of cythera and cypris lady of cyprus because both locations claimed to be the place of her birth in greek mythology aphrodite was married to hephaestus the god of fire blacksmiths and metalworking aphrodite was frequently unfaithful to him and had many lovers in the odyssey she is caught in the act of adultery with ares the god of war in the first homeric hymn to aphrodite she seduces the mortal shepherd anchises aphrodite was also the surrogate mother and lover of the mortal shepherd adonis who was killed by wild boar along with athena and hera aphrodite was one of the three goddesses whose feud resulted in the beginning of the trojan war and she plays major role throughout the iliad aphrodite has been featured in western art as symbol of female beauty and has appeared in numerous works of western literature she is major deity in modern neopagan religions including the church of aphrodite wicca and hellenismos etymology hesiod derives aphrodite from sea foam interpreting the name as risen from the foam but most modern scholars regard this as spurious folk etymology early modern scholars of classical mythology attempted to argue that aphrodite name was of greek or indo european origin but these efforts have now been mostly abandoned aphrodite name is generally accepted to be of non greek probably semitic origin but its exact derivation cannot be determined scholars in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries accepting hesiod foam etymology as genuine analyzed the second part of aphrodite name as odítē wanderer or dítē bright more recently michael janda also accepting hesiod etymology has argued in favor of the latter of these interpretations and claims the story of birth from the foam as an indo european mytheme similarly krzysztof tomasz witczak proposes an indo european compound very and to shine also referring to eos and daniel kölligan has interpreted her name as shining up from the mist foam other scholars have argued that these hypotheses are unlikely since aphrodite attributes are entirely different from those of both eos and the vedic deity ushas number of improbable non greek etymologies have also been suggested one semitic etymology compares aphrodite to the assyrian barīrītu the name of female demon that appears in middle babylonian and late babylonian texts hammarström looks to etruscan comparing prϑni lord an etruscan honorific loaned into greek as πρύτανις this would make the theonym in origin an honorific the lady most scholars reject this etymology as implausible especially since aphrodite actually appears in etruscan in the borrowed form apru from greek clipped form of aphrodite the medieval etymologicum magnum offers highly contrived etymology deriving aphrodite from the compound habrodíaitos she who lives delicately from habrós and díaita the alteration from to ph is explained as familiar characteristic of greek obvious from the macedonians origins near eastern love goddess the cult of aphrodite in greece was imported from or at least influenced by the cult of astarte in phoenicia which in turn was influenced by the cult of the mesopotamian goddess known as ishtar to the east semitic peoples and as inanna to the sumerians pausanias states that the first to establish cult of aphrodite were the assyrians followed by the paphians of cyprus and then the phoenicians at ascalon the phoenicians in turn taught her worship to the people of cythera aphrodite took on inanna ishtar associations with sexuality and procreation furthermore she was known as ourania οὐρανία which means heavenly title corresponding to inanna role as the queen of heaven early artistic and literary portrayals of aphrodite are extremely similar on inanna ishtar like inanna ishtar aphrodite was also warrior goddess the second century ad greek geographer pausanias records that in sparta aphrodite was worshipped as aphrodite areia which means warlike he also mentions that aphrodite most ancient cult statues in sparta and on cythera showed her bearing arms modern scholars note that aphrodite warrior goddess aspects appear in the oldest strata of her worship and see it as an indication of her near eastern origins nineteenth century classical scholars had general aversion to the idea that ancient greek religion was at all influenced by the cultures of the near east but even friedrich gottlieb welcker who argued that near eastern influence on greek culture was largely confined to material culture admitted that aphrodite was clearly of phoenician origin the significant influence of near eastern culture on early greek religion in general and on the cult of aphrodite in particular is now widely recognized as dating to period of orientalization during the eighth century bc when archaic greece was on the fringes of the neo assyrian empire indo european dawn goddess
