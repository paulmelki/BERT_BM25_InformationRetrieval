amasis ii or ahmose ii was pharaoh reigned bce bce of the twenty sixth dynasty of egypt the successor of apries at sais he was the last great ruler of egypt before the persian conquest life most of our information about him is derived from herodotus ff and can only be imperfectly verified by monumental evidence according to the greek historian he was of common origins he was originally an officer in the egyptian army his birthplace was siuph at sa√Øs revolt which broke out among native egyptian soldiers gave him his opportunity to seize the throne these troops returning home from disastrous military expedition to cyrene in libya suspected that they had been betrayed in order that apries the reigning king might rule more absolutely by means of his greek mercenaries many egyptians fully sympathized with them general amasis sent to meet them and quell the revolt was proclaimed king by the rebels instead and apries who then had to rely entirely on his mercenaries was defeated apries fled to the babylonians and was captured and killed mounting an invasion of his native homeland in bce with the aid of babylonian army an inscription confirms the struggle between the native egyptian and the foreign soldiery and proves that apries was killed and honourably buried in the third year of amasis bce amasis then married ii one of the daughters of his predecessor apries in order to legitimise his kingship some information is known about the family origins of amasis his mother was certain tashereniset as bust of her today located in the british museum shows stone block from mehallet el kubra also establishes that his maternal grandmother tashereniset mother was certain tjenmutetj his court is relatively well known the head of the gate guard ahmose sa neith appears on numerous monuments including the location of his sarcophagus he was referenced on monuments of the th dynasty and apparently had special significance in his time wahibre was leader of the southern foreigners and head of the doors of foreigners so he was the highest official for border security under amasis the career of the doctor udjahorresnet began who was of particular importance to the persians several heads of the fleet are known psamtek meryneit and pasherientaihet padineith are the only known viziers polycrates tyrant of samos with pharaoh amasis ii herodotus describes how amasis ii would eventually cause confrontation with the persian armies according to herodotus amasis was asked by cambyses ii or cyrus the great for an egyptian ophthalmologist on good terms amasis seems to have complied by forcing an egyptian physician into mandatory labor causing him to leave his family behind in egypt and move to persia in forced exile in an attempt to exact revenge for this the physician grew very close to cambyses and suggested that cambyses should ask amasis for daughter in marriage in order to solidify his bonds with the egyptians cambyses complied and requested daughter of amasis for marriage amasis worrying that his daughter would be concubine to the persian king refused to give up his offspring amasis also was not willing to take on the persian empire so he concocted deception in which he forced the daughter of the ex pharaoh apries whom herodotus explicitly confirms to have been killed by amasis to go to persia instead of his own offspring this daughter of apries was none other than nitetis who was as per herodotus account tall and beautiful nitetis naturally betrayed amasis and upon being greeted by the persian king explained amasis trickery and her true origins this infuriated cambyses and he vowed to take revenge for it amasis died before cambyses reached him but his heir and son psamtik iii was defeated by the persians first cyrus the great signed alliance agreements with the lydian king croesus and nabonidus the babylonian king in bc the actual aim of the agreements was to prevent aid between egypt and her allies with both now deprived of egyptian support the persians conquered first croesus empire in bce and then the neo babylonian empire in bce herodotus also describes how just like his predecessor amasis relied on greek mercenaries and councilmen one such figure was phanes of halicarnassus who would later leave amasis for reasons that herodotus does not clearly know but suspects were personal between the two figures amasis sent one of his eunuchs to capture phanes but the eunuch was bested by the wise councilman and phanes fled to persia meeting up with cambyses and providing advice for his invasion of egypt egypt was finally lost to the persians during the battle of pelusium in bc egypt wealth statue of tasherenese mother of king amasis ii bce british museum amasis brought egypt into closer contact with greece than ever before herodotus relates that under his prudent administration egypt reached new level of wealth amasis adorned the temples of lower egypt especially with splendid monolithic shrines and other monuments his activity here is proved by existing remains for example temple built by him was excavated at tell nebesha amasis assigned the commercial colony of naucratis on the canopic branch of the nile to the greeks and when the temple of delphi was burnt he contributed talents to the rebuilding he also married greek princess named ladice daughter of king battus iii and made alliances with polycrates of samos and croesus of lydia montaigne cites the story by herodotus that ladice cured amasis of his impotence by praying to venus aphropdite under amasis egypt agricultural based economy reached its zenith herodotus who visited egypt less than century after amasis ii death writes that his kingdom consisted probably of egypt only as far as the first cataract but to this he added cyprus and his influence was great in cyrene libya in his fourth year bce amasis was able to defeat an invasion of egypt by the babylonians under nebuchadnezzar ii henceforth the babylonians experienced sufficient difficulties controlling their empire that they were forced to
