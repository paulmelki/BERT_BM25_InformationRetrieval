hercule popeau and frank howel evans monsieur poiret retired belgian police officer living in london more obvious influence on the early poirot stories is that of arthur conan doyle in an autobiography christie states was still writing in the sherlock holmes tradition eccentric detective stooge assistant with lestrade type scotland yard detective inspector japp for his part conan doyle acknowledged basing his detective stories on the model of edgar allan poe auguste dupin and his anonymous narrator and basing his character sherlock holmes on joseph bell who in his use of ratiocination prefigured poirot reliance on his little grey cells poirot also bears striking resemblance to mason fictional detective inspector hanaud of the french sûreté who first appeared in the novel at the villa rose and predates the first poirot novel by ten years christie poirot was clearly the result of her early development of the detective in her first book written in and published in belgium occupation by germany during world war provided plausible explanation of why such skilled detective would be available to solve mysteries at an english country house at the time of christie writing it was considered patriotic to express sympathy towards the belgians since the invasion of their country had constituted britain casus belli for entering world war and british wartime propaganda emphasised the rape of belgium popularity poirot first appeared in the mysterious affair at styles published in and exited in curtain published in following the latter poirot was the only fictional character to receive an obituary on the front page of the new york times by agatha christie found poirot insufferable and by she felt that he was detestable bombastic tiresome ego centric little creep yet the public loved him and christie refused to kill him off claiming that it was her duty to produce what the public liked appearance and proclivities captain arthur hastings first description of poirot agatha christie initial description of poirot in the murder on the orient express in the later books his limp is not mentioned suggesting it may have been temporary wartime injury in curtain poirot admits he was wounded when he first came to england poirot has green eyes that are repeatedly described as shining like cat when he is struck by clever idea and dark hair which he dyes later in life in curtain he admits to hastings that he wears wig and false moustache however in many of his screen incarnations he is bald or balding frequent mention is made of his patent leather shoes damage to which is frequently source of misery for him but comical for the reader poirot appearance regarded as fastidious during his early career later falls hopelessly out of fashion he employs pince nez reading glasses among poirot most significant personal attributes is the sensitivity of his stomach he suffers from sea sickness and in death in the clouds he states that his air sickness prevents him from being more alert at the time of the murder later in his life we are told poirot is extremely punctual and carries pocket watch almost to the end of his career he is also particular about his personal finances preferring to keep bank balance of pounds shillings and pence actor david suchet who portrayed poirot on television said there no question he obsessive compulsive film portrayer kenneth branagh said that he enjoyed finding the sort of obsessive compulsive in poirot as mentioned in curtain and the clocks he is fond of classical music particularly mozart and bach methods in the mysterious affair at styles poirot operates as fairly conventional clue based and logical detective reflected in his vocabulary by two common phrases his use of the little grey cells and order and method hastings is irritated by the fact that poirot sometimes conceals important details of his plans as in the big four in this novel hastings is kept in the dark throughout the climax this aspect of poirot is less evident in the later novels partly because there is rarely narrator to mislead in murder on the links still largely dependent on clues himself poirot mocks rival bloodhound detective who focuses on the traditional trail of clues established in detective fiction sherlock holmes depending on footprints fingerprints and cigar ash from this point on poirot establishes his psychological bona fides rather than painstakingly examining crime scenes he enquires into the nature of the victim or the psychology of the murderer he predicates his actions in the later novels on his underlying assumption that particular crimes are committed by particular types of people poirot focuses on getting people to talk in the early novels he casts himself in the role of papa poirot benign confessor especially to young women in later works christie made point of having poirot supply false or misleading information about himself or his background to assist him in obtaining information in the murder of roger ackroyd poirot speaks of non existent mentally disabled nephew to uncover information about homes for the mentally unfit in dumb witness poirot invents an elderly invalid mother as pretence to investigate local nurses in the big four poirot pretends to have and poses as an identical twin brother named achille however this brother was mentioned again in the labours of hercules if remember rightly though my memory isn what it was you also had brother called achille did you not poirot mind raced back over the details of achille
