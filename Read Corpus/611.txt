allan ramsay an enquiry concerning human understanding is book by the scottish empiricist philosopher david hume published in english in it was revision of an earlier effort hume treatise of human nature published anonymously in london in hume was disappointed with the reception of the treatise which fell dead born from the press as he put it and so tried again to disseminate his more developed ideas to the public by writing shorter and more polemical work the end product of his labours was the enquiry the enquiry dispensed with much of the material from the treatise in favor of clarifying and emphasizing its most important aspects for example hume views on personal identity do not appear however more vital propositions such as hume argument for the role of habit in theory of knowledge are retained this book has proven highly influential both in the years that would immediately follow and today immanuel kant points to it as the book which woke him from his self described dogmatic slumber the enquiry is widely regarded as classic in modern philosophical literature content the argument of the enquiry proceeds by series of incremental steps separated into chapters which logically succeed one another after expounding his epistemology hume explains how to apply his principles to specific topics of the different species of philosophy in the first section of the enquiry hume provides rough introduction to philosophy as whole for hume philosophy can be split into two general parts natural philosophy and the philosophy of human nature or as he calls it moral philosophy the latter investigates both actions and thoughts he emphasizes in this section by way of warning that philosophers with nuanced thoughts will likely be cast aside in favor of those whose conclusions more intuitively match popular opinion however he insists precision helps art and craft of all kinds including the craft of philosophy of the origin of ideas next hume discusses the distinction between impressions and ideas by impressions he means sensations while by ideas he means memories and imaginings according to hume the difference between the two is that ideas are less vivacious than impressions for example the idea of the taste of an orange is far inferior to the impression or sensation of actually eating one writing within the tradition of empiricism he argues that impressions are the source of all ideas hume accepts that ideas may be either the product of mere sensation or of the imagination working in conjunction with sensation according to hume the creative faculty makes use of at least four mental operations that produce imaginings out of sense impressions these operations are compounding or the addition of one idea onto another such as horn on horse to create unicorn transposing or the substitution of one part of thing with the part from another such as with the body of man upon horse to make centaur augmenting as with the case of giant whose size has been augmented and diminishing as with lilliputians whose size has been diminished hume in later chapter he also mentions the operations of mixing separating and dividing hume fig the missing shade of blue however hume admits that there is one objection to his account the problem of the missing shade of blue in this thought experiment he asks us to imagine man who has experienced every shade of blue except for one see fig he predicts that this man will be able to divine the color of this particular shade of blue despite the fact that he has never experienced it this seems to pose serious problem for the empirical account though hume brushes it aside as an exceptional case by stating that one may experience novel idea that itself is derived from combinations of previous impressions hume of the association of ideas in this chapter hume discusses how thoughts tend to come in sequences as in trains of thought he explains that there are at least three kinds of associations between ideas resemblance contiguity in space time and cause and effect he argues that there must be some universal principle that must account for the various sorts of connections that exist between ideas however he does not immediately show what this principle might be hume sceptical doubts concerning the operations of the understanding in two parts in the first part hume discusses how the objects of inquiry are either relations of ideas or matters of fact which is roughly the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions the former he tells the reader are proved by demonstration while the latter are given through experience hume in explaining how matters of fact are entirely product of experience he dismisses the notion that they may be arrived at through priori reasoning for hume every effect only follows its cause arbitrarily they are entirely distinct from one another hume in part two hume inquires into how anyone can justifiably believe that experience yields any conclusions about the world when it is asked what is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter of fact the proper answer seems to be that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect when again it is asked what is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation it may be replied in one word experience but if we still carry on our sifting humor and ask what is the foundation of all conclusions from experience this implies new question which may be of more difficult solution and explication hume he shows how satisfying argument for the validity of experience can be based neither on demonstration since it implies no contradiction that the course of nature may change nor experience since that would be circular argument hume here he is describing what would become known as the problem of induction sceptical solution of these doubts in two parts for hume we assume that experience tells us something about the world because of habit or custom which human nature forces us
