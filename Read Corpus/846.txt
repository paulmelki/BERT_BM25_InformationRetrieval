in analytic philosophy anti realism is an epistemological position first articulated by british philosopher michael dummett which encompasses many varieties such as metaphysical mathematical semantic scientific moral and epistemic the term was coined as an argument against form of realism dummett saw as colorless reductionism in anti realism the truth of statement rests on its demonstrability through internal logic mechanisms such as the context principle or intuitionistic logic in direct opposition to the realist notion that the truth of statement rests on its correspondence to an external independent reality in anti realism this external reality is hypothetical and is not assumed because it encompasses statements containing abstract ideal objects mathematical objects anti realism may apply to wide range of philosophic topics from material objects to the theoretical entities of science mathematical statement mental states events and processes the past and the future varieties metaphysical anti realism one kind of metaphysical anti realism maintains skepticism about the physical world arguing either that nothing exists outside the mind or that we would have no access to mind independent reality even if it exists the latter case often takes the form of denial of the idea that we can have experiences see myth of the given conversely most realists specifically indirect realists hold that perceptions or sense data are caused by mind independent objects but this introduces the possibility of another kind of skepticism since our understanding of causality is that the same effect can be produced by multiple causes there is lack of determinacy about what one is really perceiving as in the brain in vat scenario the main alternative to this sort of metaphysical anti realism is metaphysical realism on more abstract level model theoretic anti realist arguments hold that given set of symbols in theory can be mapped onto any number of sets of real world objects each set being model of the theory provided the relationship between the objects is the same compare with symbol grounding in ancient greek philosophy nominalist anti realist doctrines about universals were proposed by the stoics especially chrysippus in early modern philosophy conceptualist anti realist doctrines about universals were proposed by thinkers like ren√© descartes john locke baruch spinoza gottfried wilhelm leibniz george berkeley and david hume in late modern philosophy anti realist doctrines about knowledge were proposed by the german idealist georg wilhelm friedrich hegel hegel was proponent of what is now called inferentialism he believed that the ground for the axioms and the foundation for the validity of the inferences are the right consequences and that the axioms do not explain the consequence kant and hegel held conceptualist views about universals in contemporary philosophy anti realism was revived in the form of empirio criticism logical positivism semantic anti realism and scientific instrumentalism see below mathematical anti realism in the philosophy of mathematics realism is the claim that mathematical entities such as number have an observer independent existence empiricism which associates numbers with concrete physical objects and platonism in which numbers are abstract non physical entities are the preeminent forms of mathematical realism the epistemic argument against platonism has been made by paul benacerraf and hartry field platonism posits that mathematical objects are abstract entities by general agreement abstract entities cannot interact causally with physical entities the truth values of our mathematical assertions depend on facts involving platonic entities that reside in realm outside of space time whilst our knowledge of physical objects is based on our ability to perceive them and therefore to causally interact with them there is no parallel account of how mathematicians come to have knowledge of abstract objects field developed his views into fictionalism benacerraf also developed the philosophy of mathematical structuralism according to which there are no mathematical objects nonetheless some versions of structuralism are compatible with some versions of realism anti realist arguments hinge on the idea that satisfactory naturalistic account of thought processes can be given for mathematical reasoning one line of defense is to maintain that this is false so that mathematical reasoning uses some special intuition that involves contact with the platonic realm as in the argument given by sir roger penrose another line of defense is to maintain that abstract objects are relevant to mathematical reasoning in way that is non causal and not analogous to perception this argument is developed by jerrold katz in his book realistic rationalism in this book he put forward position called realistic rationalism which combines metaphysical realism and rationalism more radical defense is to deny the separation of physical world and the platonic world the mathematical universe hypothesis variety of mathematicism in that case mathematician knowledge of mathematics is one mathematical object making contact with another semantic anti realism the term anti realism was introduced by michael dummett in his paper realism in order to re examine number of classical philosophical disputes involving such doctrines as nominalism platonic realism idealism and phenomenalism the novelty of dummett approach consisted in portraying these disputes as analogous to the dispute between intuitionism and platonism in the philosophy of mathematics according to intuitionists anti realists with respect to mathematical objects the truth of mathematical statement consists in our ability to prove it according to platonic realists the truth of statement is proven in its correspondence to objective reality thus intuitionists are ready to accept statement of the form or as true only if we can prove or if we can prove in particular we cannot in general claim that or not is true the law of excluded middle since in some cases we may not be able to prove the statement nor prove the statement not similarly intuitionists object to the existence property for classical logic where one can prove without being able to produce any term of which holds dummett argues that this notion of truth lies at the bottom of various classical forms of anti realism and uses it to re interpret phenomenalism claiming that it need not take the form of reductionism dummett writings on anti
