ground based interceptor of the united states ground based midcourse defense system loaded into silo at fort greely alaska in july an anti ballistic missile abm is surface to air missile designed to counter ballistic missiles missile defense ballistic missiles are used to deliver nuclear chemical biological or conventional warheads in ballistic flight trajectory the term anti ballistic missile is generic term conveying system designed to intercept and destroy any type of ballistic threat however it is commonly used for systems specifically designed to counter ballistic missiles icbms current counter icbm systems israel arrow there are limited number of systems worldwide that can intercept ballistic missiles the russian anti ballistic missile system is used for the defense of moscow it became operational in and was preceded by the anti ballistic missile system the system uses gorgon and gazelle missiles with nuclear warheads to intercept incoming icbms the ground based midcourse defense system gmd formerly known as national missile defense nmd was first tested in and had its first successful intercept test in instead of using an explosive charge it launches hit to kill kinetic projectile to intercept an icbm the current gmd system is intended to shield the united states mainland against limited nuclear attack by rogue state such as north korea gmd does not have the ability to protect against an all out nuclear attack from russia as there are ground based interceptors deployed in against any crossing projectiles headed toward the homeland this interceptor count does not include the thaad or aegis or patriot defenses against directly incoming projectiles the aegis ballistic missile defense equipped sm block ii missile demonstrated it can shoot down an icbm target on nov the israeli arrow system entered operational service in it is designed for exo atmosphere interception of ballistic missiles during the spaceflight portion of their trajectory including those of icbms it may also act as an anti satellite weapon the indian prithvi defence vehicle mark ii has the capability to shoot down icbms it has completed developmental trials and is awaiting the indian government clearance in order to be deployed in november the us launched dummy icbm in the general direction of hawaii which triggered satellite warning to colorado air force base in response uss john finn launched missile to destroy the dummy still outside the atmosphere american plans for central european site during symposium was held by western european nations to discuss potential future ballistic missile defence programs in the end the council recommended deployment of early warning and surveillance systems as well as regionally controlled defence systems during spring reports about negotiations between the united states and poland as well as the czech republic were published the plans propose the installation of latest generation abm system with radar site in the czech republic and the launch site in poland the system was announced to be aimed against icbms from iran and north korea this caused harsh comments by russian president vladimir putin at the organization for security and co operation in europe osce security conference during spring in munich other european ministers commented that any change of strategic weapons should be negotiated on nato level and not unilaterally sic actually bilaterally between the and other states although most strategic arms reduction treaties were between the soviet union and not nato german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier expressed severe concerns about the way in which the had conveyed its plans to its european partners and criticised the administration for not having consulted russia prior to announcing its endeavours to deploy new missile defence system in central europe as of july majority of poles were opposed to hosting component of the system in poland by july missile defense agency planning and agreements had clarified enough to give more details about the aegis ashore sites in romania and poland current tactical systems people republic of china historical project project had been the prc indigenous effort to develop abm capability the academy of anti ballistic missile anti satellite was established from for the purpose of developing project the project was to involve at least three elements including the necessary sensors and guidance command systems the fan ji fj missile interceptor and the xianfeng missile intercepting cannon the fj had completed two successful flight tests during while the low altitude interceptor fj completed some successful flight tests using scaled prototypes high altitude fj interceptor was also proposed despite the development of missiles the programme was slowed down due to financial and political reasons it was finally closed down during under new leadership of deng xiaoping as it was seemingly deemed unnecessary after the anti ballistic missile treaty between the soviet union and the united states and the closure of the us safeguard abm system operational chinese system in march china tested an interceptor system comparable to the patriot missiles china has acquired and is license producing the pmu pmu series of terminal abm capable sams china produced hq sam system may possess terminal abm capabilities prc navy operating modern air defense destroyers known as the type destroyer and type destroyer are armed with naval hhq missiles the hq similar to the thaad was first tested in and subsequently few more times including in november the hq counterpart to the mim pac was first tested in surface to air missiles that supposedly have some terminal abm capability as opposed to midcourse capability hq hq hq fk hq hq hq hq development of midcourse abm in china the technology and experience from the successful anti satellite test using ground launched interceptor during january was immediately applied to current abm efforts and development china carried out land based anti ballistic missile test on january the test was exoatmospheric and done in midcourse phase and with kinetic kill vehicle china is the second country after us that demonstrated intercepting ballistic missile with kinetic kill vehicle the interceptor missile was sc the sources suggest the system is not operationally deployed as of on january china did another anti
