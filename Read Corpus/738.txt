apollo december was the final moon landing mission of nasa apollo program and remains the most recent time humans have travelled beyond low earth orbit its crew consisted of commander eugene cernan lunar module pilot harrison schmitt and command module pilot ronald evans and it carried biological experiment containing five mice launched at eastern standard time est on december apollo was type mission that included three days on the lunar surface extended scientific capability and the use of the third lunar roving vehicle lrv cernan and schmitt landed in the taurus littrow valley and completed three moonwalks taking lunar samples and deploying scientific instruments the landing site had been chosen to further the mission main goals to sample lunar highland material older than mare imbrium and to investigate the possibility of relatively recent volcanic activity evans remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module csm taking scientific measurements and photographs cernan evans schmitt and the mice returned to earth on december apollo was the first mission to have no one on board who had been test pilot test pilot joe engle lost the lunar module pilot assignment to schmitt geologist the mission included the first night launch of crewed spacecraft and the final crewed launch of saturn rocket it was also the final use of apollo hardware for its original purpose extra apollo spacecraft were later used in the skylab and apollo soyuz programs the mission broke several crewed spaceflight records including the longest moon landing longest total lunar surface extravehicular activities hours minutes largest lunar sample return kilograms or lb longest time in lunar orbit days hours and most lunar orbits crew in nasa announced that the backup crew of apollo slated to fly in would be eugene cernan ronald evans and former pilot joe engle whose flights in the had thrice taken him past the border of space because the apollo program generally slated backup crew to fly as prime crew three missions later cernan evans and engle were in line to be prime crew of apollo meanwhile harrison schmitt professional geologist was assigned to the backup crew of apollo and slated to fly as lunar module pilot on apollo however apollo was cancelled in september the scientific community subsequently pressed nasa to find way to assign geologist and not just pilot with geology training to an apollo landing so nasa assigned schmitt as the lunar module pilot of apollo that opened the question of who would fill the two other apollo slots the rest of the apollo backup crew dick gordon and vance brand or the apollo backup crew minus engle nasa director of flight crew operations deke slayton ultimately chose cernan and evans backup crew original replacement the apollo prime crew received the backup assignment since this was to be the last lunar mission and the backup crew would not rotate to another mission however when the apollo postage stamp incident became public in early the crew was reprimanded by nasa and the united states air force they were active duty officers director of flight crew operations deke slayton removed them from flight status and replaced them with young and duke from the apollo prime crew and roosa from the apollo prime and apollo backup crews support crew robert overmyer robert parker gordon fullerton mission insignia robbins medallion the insignia most prominent feature is an image of the greek sun god apollo backdropped by rendering of an american eagle the red bars on the eagle mirroring those on the flag of the united states three white stars above the red bars represent the three crewmen of the mission the background includes the moon the planet saturn and galaxy or nebula the wing of the eagle partially overlays the moon suggesting man established presence there the gaze of apollo and the direction of the eagle motion embody man intention to explore further destinations in space the patch includes along with the colors of the flag red white and blue the color gold representative of golden age of spaceflight that was to begin with apollo the image of apollo in the mission insignia is rendering of the apollo belvedere sculpture the insignia was designed by robert mccall with input from the crew planning and training sudbury ontario in may like apollo and apollo apollo was slated to be mission an apollo mission type that featured lunar surface stays of three days higher scientific capability and the usage of the lunar roving vehicle since apollo was to be the final lunar landing of the apollo program high priority landing sites that had not been visited previously were given consideration for potential exploration some sites were rejected at earlier stages thus landing in the crater copernicus was rejected because apollo had already obtained samples from that impact and three other apollo expeditions had already visited the vicinity of mare imbrium landing in the lunar highlands near the crater tycho was rejected because of the rough terrain found there landing on the lunar far side in the crater tsiolkovskiy was rejected due to technical considerations and the operational costs of maintaining communication during surface operations landing in region southwest of mare crisium was rejected on the grounds that soviet spacecraft could easily access the site luna eventually did so shortly after the apollo site selection was made after the elimination of the above sites three sites made the final consideration for apollo alphonsus crater gassendi crater and the taurus littrow valley in making the final landing site decision mission planners took into consideration the primary objectives for apollo obtaining old highlands material from substantial distance from mare imbrium sampling material from young volcanic activity less than three billion years and having minimal ground overlap with the orbital ground tracks of apollo and apollo to maximize the amount of new data obtained the taurus littrow site was selected with the prediction that the crew would be able to obtain samples of old highland material from the remnants of landslide
