this togliatti surface is an algebraic surface of degree five the picture represents portion of its real locus algebraic geometry is branch of mathematics classically studying zeros of multivariate polynomials modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques mainly from commutative algebra for solving geometrical problems about these sets of zeros the fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties which are geometric manifestations of solutions of systems of polynomial equations examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are plane algebraic curves which include lines circles parabolas ellipses hyperbolas cubic curves like elliptic curves and quartic curves like lemniscates and cassini ovals point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy given polynomial equation basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the singular points the inflection points and the points at infinity more advanced questions involve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations algebraic geometry occupies central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as complex analysis topology and number theory initially study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables the subject of algebraic geometry starts where equation solving leaves off and it becomes even more important to understand the intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of system of equations than to find specific solution this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics both conceptually and in terms of technique in the th century algebraic geometry split into several subareas the mainstream of algebraic geometry is devoted to the study of the complex points of the algebraic varieties and more generally to the points with coordinates in an algebraically closed field real algebraic geometry is the study of the real points of an algebraic variety diophantine geometry and more generally arithmetic geometry is the study of the points of an algebraic variety with coordinates in fields that are not algebraically closed and occur in algebraic number theory such as the field of rational numbers number fields finite fields function fields and adic fields large part of singularity theory is devoted to the singularities of algebraic varieties computational algebraic geometry is an area that has emerged at the intersection of algebraic geometry and computer algebra with the rise of computers it consists mainly of algorithm design and software development for the study of properties of explicitly given algebraic varieties much of the development of the mainstream of algebraic geometry in the th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework with increasing emphasis being placed on intrinsic properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space this parallels developments in topology differential and complex geometry one key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is grothendieck scheme theory which allows one to use sheaf theory to study algebraic varieties in way which is very similar to its use in the study of differential and analytic manifolds this is obtained by extending the notion of point in classical algebraic geometry point of an affine variety may be identified through hilbert nullstellensatz with maximal ideal of the coordinate ring while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals of this ring this means that point of such scheme may be either usual point or subvariety this approach also enables unification of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry mainly concerned with complex points and of algebraic number theory wiles proof of the longstanding conjecture called fermat last theorem is an example of the power of this approach basic notions zeros of simultaneous polynomials sphere and slanted circle in classical algebraic geometry the main objects of interest are the vanishing sets of collections of polynomials meaning the set of all points that simultaneously satisfy one or more polynomial equations for instance the two dimensional sphere of radius in three dimensional euclidean space could be defined as the set of all points with slanted circle in can be defined as the set of all points which satisfy the two polynomial equations affine varieties first we start with field in classical algebraic geometry this field was always the complex numbers but many of the same results are true if we assume only that is algebraically closed we consider the affine space of dimension over denoted or more simply when is clear from the context when one fixes coordinate system one may identify with the purpose of not working with is to emphasize that one forgets the vector space structure that carries function is said to be polynomial or regular if it can be written as polynomial that is if there is polynomial in such that for every point with coordinates in the property of function to be polynomial or regular does not depend on the choice of coordinate system in when coordinate system is chosen the regular functions on the affine space may be identified with the ring of polynomial functions in variables over therefore the set of the regular functions on is ring which is denoted we say that polynomial vanishes at point if evaluating it at that point gives zero let be set of polynomials in the vanishing set of or vanishing locus or zero set is the set of all points in where every polynomial in vanishes symbolically subset of which is for some is called an algebraic set the stands for variety specific type of algebraic set to be defined below given subset of can one recover the set of polynomials which generate it if is any subset of define to be the set of all polynomials whose vanishing set contains the stands for ideal if two polynomials and both vanish on then vanishes on and if is any polynomial then hf vanishes on so is always an ideal of the polynomial ring two natural questions to ask are given subset of when
