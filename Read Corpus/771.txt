by an actor or actress who adopts character in theatre television film radio or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode acting involves broad range of skills including well developed imagination emotional facility physical expressivity vocal projection clarity of speech and the ability to interpret drama acting also demands an ability to employ dialects accents improvisation observation and emulation mime and stage combat many actors train at length in specialist programmes or colleges to develop these skills the vast majority of professional actors have undergone extensive training actors and actresses will often have many instructors and teachers for full range of training involving singing scene work audition techniques and acting for camera most early sources in the west that examine the art of acting hypokrisis discuss it as part of rhetoric history one of the first known actors was an ancient greek called thespis of icaria writing two centuries after the event aristotle in his poetics suggests that thespis stepped out of the dithyrambic chorus and addressed it as separate character before thespis the chorus narrated for example dionysus did this dionysus said that when thespis stepped out from the chorus he spoke as if he was the character for example am dionysus did this to distinguish between these different modes of storytelling enactment and narration aristotle uses the terms mimesis via enactment and diegesis via narration from thespis name derives the word thespian training stanislavski began to develop his system of actor training which forms the basis for most professional training in the west conservatories and drama schools typically offer two to four year training on all aspects of acting universities mostly offer three to four year programs in which student is often able to choose to focus on acting whilst continuing to learn about other aspects of theatre schools vary in their approach but in north america the most popular method taught derives from the system of konstantin stanislavski which was developed and popularised in america as method acting by lee strasberg stella adler sanford meisner and others other approaches may include more physically based orientation such as that promoted by theatre practitioners as diverse as anne bogart jacques lecoq jerzy grotowski or vsevolod meyerhold classes may also include psychotechnique mask work physical theatre improvisation and acting for camera regardless of school approach students should expect intensive training in textual interpretation voice and movement applications to drama programmes and conservatories usually involve extensive auditions anybody over the age of can usually apply training may also start at very young age acting classes and professional schools targeted at under are widespread these classes introduce young actors to different aspects of acting and theatre including scene study increased training and exposure to public speaking allows humans to maintain calmer and more relaxed physiologically by measuring public speaker heart rate maybe one of the easiest ways to judge shifts in stress as the heart rate increases with anxiety as actors increase performances heart rate and other evidence of stress can decrease this is very important in training for actors as adaptive strategies gained from increased exposure to public speaking can regulate implicit and explicit anxiety by attending an institution with specialization in acting increased opportunity to act will lead to more relaxed physiology and decrease in stress and its effects on the body these effects can vary from hormonal to cognitive health that can impact quality of life and performance improvisation two masked characters from the commedia dell arte whose lazzi involved significant degree of improvisation some classical forms of acting involve substantial element of improvised performance most notable is its use by the troupes of the commedia dell arte form of masked comedy that originated in italy improvisation as an approach to acting formed an important part of the russian theatre practitioner konstantin stanislavski system of actor training which he developed from the onwards late in the playwright maxim gorky invited stanislavski to join him in capri where they discussed training and stanislavski emerging grammar of acting inspired by popular theatre performance in naples that utilised the techniques of the commedia dell arte gorky suggested that they form company modelled on the medieval strolling players in which playwright and group of young actors would devise new plays together by means of improvisation stanislavski would develop this use of improvisation in his work with his first studio of the moscow art theatre stanislavski use was extended further in the approaches to acting developed by his students michael chekhov and maria knebel in the united kingdom the use of improvisation was pioneered by joan littlewood from the onwards and later by keith johnstone and clive barker in the united states it was promoted by viola spolin after working with neva boyd at hull house in chicago illinois spolin was boyd student from to like the british practitioners spolin felt that playing games was useful means of training actors and helped to improve an actor performance with improvisation she argued people may find expressive freedom since they do not know how an improvised situation will turn out improvisation demands an open mind in order to maintain spontaneity rather than pre planning response character is created by the actor often without reference to dramatic text and drama is developed out of the spontaneous interactions with other actors this approach to creating new drama has been developed most substantially by the british filmmaker mike leigh in films such as secrets lies vera drake another year and mr turner improvisation is also used to cover up if an actor or actress makes mistake physiological effects speaking or acting in front of an audience is stressful situation which causes an increased heart rate in study on american university students actors of various experience levels all showed similarly elevated
