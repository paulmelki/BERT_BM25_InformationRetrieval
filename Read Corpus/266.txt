fig an audio signal top may be carried by alt animation of audio am and fm modulated carriers amplitude modulation am is modulation technique used in electronic communication most commonly for transmitting messages with radio carrier wave in amplitude modulation the amplitude signal strength of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to that of the message signal such as an audio signal this technique contrasts with angle modulation in which either the frequency of the carrier wave is varied as in frequency modulation or its phase as in phase modulation am was the earliest modulation method used for transmitting audio in radio broadcasting it was developed during the first quarter of the th century beginning with roberto landell de moura and reginald fessenden radiotelephone experiments in this original form of am is sometimes called double sideband amplitude modulation dsbam because the standard method produces sidebands on either side of the carrier frequency single sideband modulation uses bandpass filters to eliminate one of the sidebands and possibly the carrier signal which improves the ratio of message power to total transmission power reduces power handling requirements of line repeaters and permits better bandwidth utilization of the transmission medium am remains in use in many forms of communication in addition to am broadcasting shortwave radio amateur radio two way radios vhf aircraft radio citizens band radio and in computer modems in the form of qam forms in electronics and modulation means varying some aspect of continuous wave carrier signal with an information bearing modulation waveform such as an audio signal which represents sound or video signal which represents images in this sense the carrier wave which has much higher frequency than the message signal carries the information at the receiving station the message signal is extracted from the modulated carrier by demodulation in amplitude modulation the amplitude or strength of the carrier oscillations is varied for example in am radio communication continuous wave radio frequency signal sinusoidal carrier wave has its amplitude modulated by an audio waveform before transmission the audio waveform modifies the amplitude of the carrier wave and determines the envelope of the waveform in the frequency domain amplitude modulation produces signal with power concentrated at the carrier frequency and two adjacent sidebands each sideband is equal in bandwidth to that of the modulating signal and is mirror image of the other standard am is thus sometimes called double sideband amplitude modulation dsbam single sideband amplitude modulation disadvantage of all amplitude modulation techniques not only standard am is that the receiver amplifies and detects noise and electromagnetic interference in equal proportion to the signal increasing the received signal to noise ratio say by factor of decibel improvement thus would require increasing the transmitter power by factor of this is in contrast to frequency modulation fm and digital radio where the effect of such noise following demodulation is strongly reduced so long as the received signal is well above the threshold for reception for this reason am broadcast is not favored for music and high fidelity broadcasting but rather for voice communications and broadcasts sports news talk radio etc am is also inefficient in power usage at least two thirds of the power is concentrated in the carrier signal the carrier signal contains none of the original information being transmitted voice video data etc however its presence provides simple means of demodulation using envelope detection providing frequency and phase reference to extract the modulation from the sidebands in some modulation systems based on am lower transmitter power is required through partial or total elimination of the carrier component however receivers for these signals are more complex because they must provide precise carrier frequency reference signal usually as shifted to the intermediate frequency from greatly reduced pilot carrier in reduced carrier transmission or dsb rc to use in the demodulation process even with the carrier totally eliminated in double sideband suppressed carrier transmission carrier regeneration is possible using costas phase locked loop this does not work for single sideband suppressed carrier transmission ssb sc leading to the characteristic donald duck sound from such receivers when slightly detuned single sideband am is nevertheless used widely in amateur radio and other voice communications because it has power and bandwidth efficiency cutting the rf bandwidth in half compared to standard am on the other hand in medium wave and short wave broadcasting standard am with the full carrier allows for reception using inexpensive receivers the broadcaster absorbs the extra power cost to greatly increase potential audience an additional function provided by the carrier in standard am but which is lost in either single or double sideband suppressed carrier transmission is that it provides an amplitude reference in the receiver the automatic gain control agc responds to the carrier so that the reproduced audio level stays in fixed proportion to the original modulation on the other hand with suppressed carrier transmissions there is no transmitted power during pauses in the modulation so the agc must respond to peaks of the transmitted power during peaks in the modulation this typically involves so called fast attack slow decay circuit which holds the agc level for second or more following such peaks in between syllables or short pauses in the program this is very acceptable for communications radios where compression of the audio aids intelligibility however it is absolutely undesired for music or normal broadcast programming where faithful reproduction of the original program including its varying modulation levels is expected simple form of amplitude modulation is the transmission of speech signals from the traditional analog telephone set using common battery local loop the direct current provided by the central office battery is carrier with frequency of hz that is modulated by microphone transmitter in the telephone set according to the acoustic signal from the mouth of the speaker the result is varying amplitude direct current whose ac component is the speech signal extracted at the central office for transmission to another subscriber simple form of digital amplitude modulation which
