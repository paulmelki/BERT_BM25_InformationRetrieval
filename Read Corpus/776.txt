alexander grothendieck march november was mathematician who became the leading figure in the creation of modern algebraic geometry his research extended the scope of the field and added elements of commutative algebra homological algebra sheaf theory and category theory to its foundations while his so called relative perspective led to revolutionary advances in many areas of pure mathematics he is considered by many to be the greatest mathematician of the th century born in germany grothendieck was raised and lived primarily in france and he and his family were persecuted by the nazi regime for much of his working life however he was in effect stateless as he consistently spelled his first name alexander rather than alexandre and his surname taken from his mother was the dutch like low german grothendieck he was sometimes mistakenly believed to be of dutch origin grothendieck began his productive and public career as mathematician in in he was appointed research professor at the institut des hautes études scientifiques ihés and remained there until when driven by personal and political convictions he left following dispute over military funding he received his fields medal in for advances in algebraic geometry homological algebra and theory he later became professor at the university of montpellier and while still producing relevant mathematical work he withdrew from the mathematical community and devoted himself to political and religious pursuits first buddhism and later more christian vision in he moved to the french village of lasserre in the pyrenees where he lived secluded still working tirelessly on mathematics until his death in life family and childhood grothendieck was born in berlin to anarchist parents his father alexander sascha schapiro also known as alexander tanaroff had hasidic jewish roots and had been imprisoned in russia before moving to germany in while his mother johanna hanka grothendieck came from protestant family in hamburg and worked as journalist both had broken away from their early backgrounds in their teens at the time of his birth grothendieck mother was married to the journalist johannes raddatz and his birth name was initially recorded as alexander raddatz the marriage was dissolved in and schapiro tanaroff acknowledged his paternity but never married hanka grothendieck lived with his parents in berlin until the end of when his father moved to paris to evade nazism followed soon thereafter by his mother they left grothendieck in the care of wilhelm heydorn lutheran pastor and teacher in hamburg during this time his parents took part in the spanish civil war according to winfried scharlau as non combatant auxiliaries though others state that sascha fought in the anarchist militia world war ii in may grothendieck was put on train in hamburg for france shortly afterwards his father was interned in le vernet he and his mother were then interned in various camps from to as undesirable dangerous foreigners the first was the rieucros camp where his mother contracted the tuberculosis which eventually caused her death and where alexander managed to attend the local school at mende once alexander managed to escape from the camp intending to assassinate hitler later his mother hanka was transferred to the gurs internment camp for the remainder of world war ii alexander was permitted to live separated from his mother in the village of le chambon sur lignon sheltered and hidden in local boarding houses or pensions though he occasionally had to seek refuge in the woods during nazis raids surviving at times without food or water for several days his father was arrested under the vichy anti jewish legislation and sent to the drancy and then handed over by the french vichy government to the germans to be sent to be murdered at the auschwitz concentration camp in in chambon grothendieck attended the collège cévenol now known as the le collège lycée cévenol international unique secondary school founded in by local protestant pacifists and anti war activists many of the refugee children hidden in chambon attended cévenol and it was at this school that grothendieck apparently first became fascinated with mathematics studies and contact with research mathematics after the war the young grothendieck studied mathematics in france initially at the university of montpellier where he did not initially perform well failing such classes as astronomy working on his own he rediscovered the lebesgue measure after three years of increasingly independent studies there he went to continue his studies in paris in initially grothendieck attended henri cartan seminar at école normale supérieure but he lacked the necessary background to follow the high powered seminar on the advice of cartan and andré weil he moved to the university of nancy where he wrote his dissertation under laurent schwartz and jean dieudonné on functional analysis from to at this time he was leading expert in the theory of topological vector spaces from to he moved to the university of são paulo in brazil where he immigrated by means of nansen passport given that he refused to take french nationality by he set this subject aside in order to work in algebraic geometry and homological algebra the same year he was invited to visit harvard by oscar zariski but the offer fell through when he refused to sign pledge promising not to work to overthrow the united states government position that he was warned might have landed him in prison the prospect did not worry him as long as he could have access to books comparing grothendieck during his nancy years to the école normale supérieure trained students at that time pierre samuel roger godement rené thom jacques dixmier jean cerf yvonne bruhat jean pierre serre bernard malgrange leila schneps says his first works on topological vector spaces in have been successfully applied to physics and computer science culminating in relation between grothendieck inequality and the einstein podolsky rosen paradox in quantum physics ihés years in grothendieck was installed at the institut des hautes études scientifiques ihés new privately funded research institute that in effect had been created for jean dieudonné and
