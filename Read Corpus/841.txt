roussow speaking afrikaans alaric speaking afrikaans afrikaans is west germanic language spoken in south africa namibia and to lesser extent botswana zambia and zimbabwe it evolved from the dutch vernacular of holland hollandic dialect spoken by the dutch settlers in south africa where it gradually began to develop distinguishing characteristics in the course of the th century hence it is daughter language of dutch although afrikaans has adopted words from other languages including german and the khoisan languages an estimated to of the vocabulary of afrikaans is of dutch origin therefore differences with dutch often lie in the more analytic type morphology and grammar of afrikaans and spelling that expresses afrikaans pronunciation rather than standard dutch there is large degree of mutual intelligibility between the two languages especially in written form with about seven million native speakers in south africa or of the population it is the third most spoken language in the country estimates of the total number of afrikaans speakers range between and million it has the widest geographic and racial distribution of all the official languages of south africa and is widely spoken and understood as second or third language it is the majority language of the western half of south africa the provinces of the northern cape and western cape and the first language of of coloured south africans million people of white south africans million of asian south africans people and of black south africans people etymology the term is derived from the dutch term meaning african it was previously referred to as cape dutch term also used to refer collectively to the early cape settlers or kitchen dutch derogatory term used to refer to afrikaans in its earlier days however it has also been variously described as dutch based creole or as partially creolised language afrikaans is rooted in seventeenth century dialects of dutch see afrikaans is variously described as creole partially creolised language or deviant variety of dutch see history origin the afrikaans language arose in the dutch cape colony through gradual divergence from european dutch dialects during the course of the th century as early as the mid th century and as recently as the mid th century afrikaans was known in standard dutch as kitchen language lacking the prestige accorded for example even by the educational system in africa to languages spoken outside africa other early epithets setting apart cape dutch afrikaans as putatively beneath official dutch standards included and mutilated broken uncivilised dutch as well as incorrect dutch den besten theorises that modern standard afrikaans derives from two sources cape dutch direct transplantation of european dutch to southern africa and hottentot dutch pidgin that descended from foreigner talk and ultimately from the dutch pidgin spoken by slaves via hypothetical dutch creole thus in his view afrikaans is neither creole nor direct descendant of dutch but fusion of two transmission pathways development relative majority of the first settlers whose descendants today are the afrikaners were from the united provinces now netherlands and flanders though up to one sixth of the community was also of french huguenot origin and seventh from germany african and asian workers and slaves contributed to the development of afrikaans the slave population was made up of people from east africa west africa india madagascar and the dutch east indies modern indonesia number were also indigenous khoisan people who were valued as interpreters domestic servants and labourers many free and enslaved women married cohabited with or were victims of sexual violence from the male dutch settlers valkhoff argued that

conditioned by nonwhites who learned dutch imperfectly as second language beginning in about afrikaans started to replace malay as the language of instruction in muslim schools in south africa written with the arabic alphabet see arabic afrikaans later afrikaans now written with the latin script started to appear in newspapers and political and religious works in around alongside the already established dutch in group of afrikaans speakers from the cape formed the society for real afrikaners and published number of books in afrikaans including grammars dictionaries religious materials and histories in afrikaans was recognised by the south african government as real language rather than simply slang version of dutch proper recognition this is our passion afrikaans was formally considered dutch dialect in south africa until the early th century when it became recognised as distinct language under south african law alongside standard dutch which it eventually replaced as an official language before the boer wars and indeed for some time afterwards afrikaans was regarded as inappropriate for educated discourse rather afrikaans was described derogatorily as kitchen language or bastard jargon suitable for communication mainly between the boers and their servants on may twenty three years after the second boer war ended the official languages of the union act of was passed mostly due to the efforts of the afrikaans language movement at joint sitting of the house of assembly and the senate in which the afrikaans language was declared variety of dutch the constitution of reversed the position of afrikaans and dutch so that english and afrikaans were the official languages and afrikaans was deemed to include dutch the constitution of removed any mention of dutch altogether the afrikaans language monument is located on hill overlooking paarl in the western cape province officially opened on october it was erected on the th anniversary of the founding of the society of real afrikaners and the th anniversary of afrikaans being declared an official language of south africa in distinction to dutch standardisation the side view of the pretoria art
