advanced chemistry is german hip hop group from heidelberg scenic city in baden w√ºrttemberg south germany advanced chemistry was founded in by toni linguist gee one dj mike md mike dippon and mc torch each member of the group holds german citizenship and toni linguist and torch are of italian ghanaian and haitian backgrounds respectively influenced by north american socially conscious rap and the native tongues movement advanced chemistry is regarded as one of the main pioneers in german hip hop they were one of the first groups to rap in german although their name is in english furthermore their songs tackled controversial social and political issues distinguishing them from early german hip hop group die fantastischen vier the fantastic four which had more light hearted playful party image career one of the first issues that confronts us when we move outside the english speaking market for recorded music is to establish whether or not the discrete musical genres we know from that market are fully congruent with similar divisions in other pop worlds this is important in two ways first although no single country comes close to matching the amounts spent on recorded music in the united states these markets are nonetheless economically significant germany for instance is the largest single market in western europe with estimated annual sales of billion in this represents around percent of reported sales and makes germany the third biggest music market in the world advanced chemistry frequently rapped about their lives and experiences as children of immigrants exposing the marginalization experienced by most ethnic minorities in germany and the feelings of frustration and resentment that being denied german identity can cause the song fremd im eigenen land foreign in your own nation was released by advanced chemistry in november the single became staple in the german hip hop scene it made strong statement about the status of immigrants throughout germany as the group was composed of multi national and multi racial members the video shows several members brandishing their german passports as demonstration of their german citizenship to skeptical and unaccepting ethnic germans this idea of national identity is important as many rap artists in germany have been of foreign origin these so called gastarbeiter guest workers children saw breakdance graffiti rap music and hip hop culture as means of expressing themselves since the release of fremd im eigenen land many other german language rappers have also tried to confront anti immigrant ideas and develop themes of citizenship however though many ethnic minority youth in germany find these german identity themes appealing others view the desire of immigrants to be seen as german negatively and they have actively sought to revive and recreate concepts of identity in connection to traditional ethnic origins advanced chemistry helped to found the german chapter of the zulu nation the rivalry between advanced chemistry and die fantastischen vier has served to highlight dichotomy in the routes that hip hop has taken in becoming part of the german soundscape while die fantastischen vier may be said to view hip hop primarily as an aesthetic art form advanced chemistry understand hip hop as being inextricably linked to the social and political circumstances under which it is created for advanced chemistry hip hop is vehicle of general human emancipation in their undertaking of social and political issues the band introduced the term afro german into the context of german hip hop and the theme of race is highlighted in much of their music with the release of the single fremd im eigenen land advanced chemistry separated itself from the rest of the rap being produced in germany this single was the first of its kind to go beyond simply imitating us rap and addressed the current issues of the time fremd im eigenen land which translates to foreign in my own country dealt with the widespread racism that non white german citizens faced this change from simple imitation to political commentary was the start of german identification with rap the sound of fremd im eigenen land was influenced by the wall of noise created by public enemy producers the bomb squad after the reunification of germany an abundance of anti immigrant sentiment emerged as well as attacks on the homes of refugees in the early advanced chemistry came to prominence in the wake of these actions because of their pro multicultural society stance in their music advanced chemistry attitudes revolve around their attempts to create distinct germanness in hip hop as opposed to imitating american hip hop as other groups had done torch has said what the americans do is exotic for us because we don live like they do what they do seems to be more interesting and newer but not for me for me it more exciting to experience my fellow germans in new contexts for me it interesting to see what the kids try to do that different from what know advanced chemistry were the first to use the term afro german in hip hop context this was part of the pro immigrant political message they sent via their music while advanced chemistry use of the german language in their rap allows them to make claims to authenticity and true german heritage bolstering pro immigration sentiment their style can also be problematic for immigrant notions of any real ethnic roots indeed part of the turkish ethnic minority of frankfurt views advanced chemistry appeal to the german image as symbolic betrayal of the right of ethnic minorities to roots or to any expression of cultural heritage in this sense their rap represents complex social discourse internal to the german soundscape in which they attempt to negotiate immigrant assimilation into xenophobic german culture with the maintenance of their own separate cultural traditions it is quite possibly the feelings of alienation from the pure blooded german demographic that drive advanced chemistry to attack nationalistic ideologies by asserting their germanness as group composed primarily of ethnic others the response to this pseudo
