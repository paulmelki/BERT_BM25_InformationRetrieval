aluminium aluminum in american and canadian english is chemical element with the symbol al and atomic number it is silvery white soft non magnetic and ductile metal in the boron group by mass aluminium is the most abundant metal in the earth crust and the third most abundant element after oxygen and silicon the abundance of aluminium decreases relative to other elements at greater depths into earth mantle and beyond the chief ore of aluminium is bauxite aluminium metal is highly reactive so native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments instead it is found combined in over different minerals aluminium is remarkable for its low density and its ability to resist corrosion through the phenomenon of passivation aluminium and its alloys are vital to the aerospace industry and important in transportation and building industries such as building facades and window frames the oxides and sulfates are the most useful compounds of aluminium despite its prevalence in the environment no living organism is known to use aluminium salts metabolically but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals because of these salts abundance the potential for biological role for them is of continuing interest and studies continue physical characteristics isotopes of aluminium isotopes only is stable this is consistent with aluminium having an odd atomic number it is the only primordial aluminium isotope the only one that has existed on earth in its current form since the formation of the planet nearly all aluminium on earth is present as this isotope which makes it mononuclidic element and means that its standard atomic weight is virtually the same as that of the isotope the standard atomic weight of aluminium is low in comparison with many other metals which has consequences for the element properties see below this makes aluminium very useful in nuclear magnetic resonance nmr as its single stable isotope has high nmr sensitivity all other isotopes of aluminium are radioactive the most stable of these is al while it was present along with stable al in the interstellar medium from which the solar system formed having been produced by stellar nucleosynthesis as well its half life is only years and therefore detectable amount has not survived since the formation of the planet however minute traces of al are produced from argon in the atmosphere by spallation caused by cosmic ray protons the ratio of al to be has been used for radiodating of geological processes over to year time scales in particular transport deposition sediment storage burial times and erosion most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of al was responsible for the melting and differentiation of some asteroids after their formation billion years ago the remaining isotopes of aluminium with mass numbers ranging from to all have half lives well under an hour three metastable states are known all with half lives under minute electron shell an aluminium atom has electrons arranged in an electron configuration of ne with three electrons beyond stable noble gas configuration accordingly the combined first three ionization energies of aluminium are far lower than the fourth ionization energy alone such an electron configuration is shared with the other well characterized members of its group boron gallium indium and thallium it is also expected for nihonium aluminium can relatively easily surrender its three outermost electrons in many chemical reactions see below the of aluminium is pauling scale stem haadf micrograph of al atoms viewed along the zone axis free aluminium atom has radius of pm with the three outermost electrons removed the radius shrinks to pm for coordinated atom or pm for coordinated atom at standard temperature and pressure aluminium atoms when not affected by atoms of other elements form face centered cubic crystal system bound by metallic bonding provided by atoms outermost electrons hence aluminium at these conditions is metal this crystal system is shared by many other metals such as lead and copper the size of unit cell of aluminium is comparable to that of those other metals it is however not shared by the other members of its group boron has ionization energies too high to allow metallization thallium has hexagonal close packed structure and gallium and indium have unusual structures that are not close packed like those of aluminium and thallium since few electrons are available for metallic bonding aluminium metal is soft with low melting point and low electrical resistivity as is common for post transition metals bulk aluminium metal has an appearance ranging from silvery white to dull gray depending on the surface roughness fresh film of aluminium serves as good reflector approximately of visible light and an excellent reflector as much as of medium and far infrared radiation the density of aluminium is cm about that of steel much lower than other commonly encountered metals making aluminium parts easily identifiable through their lightness aluminium low density compared to most other metals arises from the fact that its nuclei are much lighter while difference in the unit cell size does not compensate for this difference the only lighter metals are the metals of groups and which apart from beryllium and magnesium are too reactive for structural use and beryllium is very toxic aluminium is not as strong or stiff as steel but the low density makes up for this in the aerospace industry and for many other applications where light weight and relatively high strength are crucial pure aluminium is quite soft and lacking in strength in most applications various aluminium alloys are used instead because of their higher strength and hardness the yield strength of pure aluminium is mpa while aluminium alloys have yield strengths ranging from mpa to mpa aluminium is ductile with percent elongation of and malleable allowing it to be easily drawn and extruded it is also easily machined and cast aluminium is an excellent thermal and electrical conductor having around the conductivity of copper both thermal and electrical while having only of copper density aluminium is capable
