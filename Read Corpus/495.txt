alboin june was king of the lombards from about until during his reign the lombards ended their migrations by settling in italy the northern part of which alboin conquered between and he had lasting effect on italy and the pannonian basin in the former his invasion marked the beginning of centuries of lombard rule and in the latter his defeat of the gepids and his departure from pannonia ended the dominance there of the germanic peoples the period of alboin reign as king in pannonia following the death of his father audoin was one of confrontation and conflict between the lombards and their main neighbors the gepids the gepids initially gained the upper hand but in thanks to his alliance with the avars alboin inflicted decisive defeat on his enemies whose lands the avars subsequently occupied the increasing power of his new neighbours caused alboin some unease however and he therefore decided to leave pannonia for italy hoping to take advantage of the byzantine empire reduced ability to defend its territory in the wake of the gothic war after gathering large coalition of peoples alboin crossed the julian alps in entering an almost undefended italy he rapidly took control of most of venetia and liguria in unopposed he took northern italy main city milan pavia offered stiff resistance however and was taken only after siege lasting three years during that time alboin turned his attention to tuscany but signs of factionalism among his supporters and alboin diminishing control over his army increasingly began to manifest themselves alboin was assassinated on june in coup état instigated by the byzantines it was organized by the king foster brother helmichis with the support of alboin wife rosamund daughter of the gepid king whom alboin had killed some years earlier the coup failed in the face of opposition from majority of the lombards who elected cleph as alboin successor forcing helmichis and rosamund to flee to ravenna under imperial protection alboin death deprived the lombards of the only leader who could have kept the newborn germanic entity together the last in the line of hero kings who had led the lombards through their migrations from the vale of the elbe to italy for many centuries following his death alboin heroism and his success in battle were celebrated in saxon and bavarian epic poetry name the name alboin derives from the proto germanic roots albiz elf and winiz friend it is thus cognate with the old english name ælfwine he was known in latin as alboinus and in greek as αλβοΐνος alvoinos in modern italian he is alboino and in modern lombard albuì father rule the lombards under king wacho had migrated towards the east into pannonia taking advantage of the difficulties facing the ostrogothic kingdom in italy following the death of its founder theodoric in wacho death in about brought his son walthari to the throne but as the latter was still minor the kingdom was governed in his stead by alboin father audoin of the gausian clan seven years later walthari died giving audoin the opportunity to crown himself and overthrow the reigning lethings alboin was probably born in the in pannonia the son of audoin and his wife rodelinda she may have been the niece of king theodoric and betrothed to audoin through the mediation of emperor justinian like his father alboin was raised pagan although audoin had at one point attempted to gain byzantine support against his neighbours by professing himself christian alboin took as his first wife the christian chlothsind daughter of the frankish king chlothar this marriage which took place soon after the death of the frankish ruler theudebald in is thought to reflect audoin decision to distance himself from the byzantines traditional allies of the lombards who had been lukewarm when it came to supporting audoin against the gepids the new frankish alliance was important because of the franks known hostility to the byzantine empire providing the lombards with more than one option however the prosopography of the later roman empire interprets events and sources differently believing that alboin married chlothsind when already king in or shortly before the year of chlothar death alboin first distinguished himself on the battlefield in clash with the gepids at the battle of asfeld he killed turismod son of the gepid king thurisind in victory that resulted in the emperor justinian intervention to maintain equilibrium between the rival regional powers after the battle according to tradition reported by paul the deacon to be granted the right to sit at his father table alboin had to ask for the hospitality of foreign king and have him donate his weapons as was customary for this initiation he went to the court of thurisind where the gepid king gave him turismod arms walter goffart believes it is probable that in this narrative paul was making use of an oral tradition and is sceptical that it can be dismissed as merely typical topos of an epic poem reign in pannonia alboin came to the throne after the death of his father sometime between and as was customary among the lombards alboin took the crown after an election by the tribe freemen who traditionally selected the king from the dead sovereign clan shortly afterwards in new war erupted with the gepids now led by cunimund thurisind son the cause of the conflict is uncertain as the sources are divided the lombard paul the deacon accuses the gepids while the byzantine historian menander protector places the blame on alboin an interpretation favoured by historian walter pohl an account of the war by the byzantine theophylact simocatta sentimentalises the reasons behind the conflict claiming it originated with alboin vain courting and subsequent kidnapping of cunimund daughter rosamund that alboin proceeded then to marry the tale is treated with scepticism by walter goffart who observes that it conflicts with the origo gentis langobardorum where she was captured only after the death of her father the gepids obtained the support of
