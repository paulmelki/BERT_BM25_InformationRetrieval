scottish parliament was more reluctant than the english to abandon the house of stuart members of which had been scottish monarchs long before they became english ones english pressure on scotland to accept the act of settlement was one factor leading to the parliamentary union of the two countries in under the act of settlement anyone who became roman catholic or who married one became disqualified to inherit the throne the act also placed limits on both the role of foreigners in the british government and the power of the monarch with respect to the parliament of england some of
