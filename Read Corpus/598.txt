ānanda th th century bce was the primary attendant of the buddha and one of his ten principal disciples among the buddha many disciples ānanda stood out for having the best memory most of the texts of the early buddhist sutta piṭaka pāli are attributed to his recollection of the buddha teachings during the first buddhist council for that reason he is known as the treasurer of the dhamma with dhamma referring to the buddha teaching in early buddhist texts ānanda was the first cousin of the buddha although the early texts do not agree on many parts of ānanda early life they do agree that ānanda was ordained as monk and that puṇṇa mantāniputta became his teacher twenty years in the buddha ministry ānanda became the attendant of the buddha when the buddha selected him for this task ānanda performed his duties with great devotion and care and acted as an intermediary between the buddha and the laypeople as well as the saṅgha he accompanied the buddha for the rest of his life acting not only as an assistant but also secretary and mouthpiece scholars are skeptical about the historicity of many events in ānanda life especially the first council and consensus about this has yet to be established traditional account can be drawn from early texts commentaries and post canonical chronicles ānanda had an important role in establishing the order of bhikkhunīs when he requested the buddha on behalf of the latter foster mother mahāpajāpati gotamī to allow her to be ordained ānanda also accompanied the buddha in the last year of his life and therefore was witness to many tenets and principles that the buddha conveyed before his death including the well known principle that the buddhist community should take his teaching and discipline as their refuge and that he would not appoint new leader the final period of the buddha life also shows that ānanda was very much attached to the buddha person and he saw the buddha passing with great sorrow shortly after the buddha death the first council was convened and ānanda managed to attain enlightenment just before the council started which was requirement he had historical role during the council as the living memory of the buddha reciting many of the buddha discourses and checking them for accuracy during the same council however he was chastised by mahākassapa and the rest of the saṅgha for allowing women to be ordained and failing to understand or respect the buddha at several crucial moments ānanda continued to teach until the end of his life passing on his spiritual heritage to his pupils sāṇavāsī and majjhantika among others who later assumed leading roles in the second and third councils ānanda died years after the buddha and stūpas monuments were erected at the river where he died ānanda is one of the most loved figures in buddhism he was known for his memory erudition and compassion and was often praised by the buddha for these matters he functioned as foil to the buddha however in that he still had worldly attachments and was not yet enlightened as opposed to the buddha in the sanskrit textual traditions ānanda is considered the patriarch of the dhamma who stood in spiritual lineage receiving the teaching from mahākassapa and passing them on to his own pupils ānanda has been honored by bhikkhunīs since early medieval times for his merits in establishing the nun order in recent times the composer richard wagner and indian poet rabindranath tagore were inspired by stories about ānanda in their work name the word ānanda means bliss joy in pāli and in sanskrit pāli commentaries explain that when ānanda was born his relatives were joyous about this texts from the tradition however state that since ānanda was born on the day of the buddha enlightenment there was great rejoicing in the cityhence the name accounts previous lives according to the texts in previous life ānanda made an aspiration to become buddha attendant he made this aspiration in the time of previous buddha called padumuttara many eons before the present age he met the attendant of padumuttara buddha and aspired to be like him in future life after having done many good deeds he made his resolution known to the padumuttara buddha who confirmed that his wish will come true in future life after having been born and reborn throughout many lifetimes and doing many good deeds he was born as ānanda in the time of the current buddha gotama early life upright ānanda was born in the same time period as the buddha formerly prince siddhattha which scholars place at th th centuries bce tradition says that ānanda was the first cousin of the buddha his father being the brother of suddhodana the buddha father in the pāli and textual traditions his father was amitodana but the mahāvastu states that his father was śuklodanaboth are brothers of suddhodana the mahāvastu also mentions that ānanda mother name was mṛgī sanskrit lit little deer pāli is unknown the pāli tradition has it that ānanda was born on the same day as prince siddhatta but texts from the and subsequent mahāyāna traditions state ānanda was born at the same time the buddha attained enlightenment when prince siddhattha was years old and was therefore much younger than the buddha the latter tradition is corroborated by several instances in the early buddhist texts in which ānanda appears younger than the buddha such as the passage in which the buddha explained to ānanda how old age was affecting him in body and mind it is also corroborated by verse in the pāli text called theragāthā in which ānanda stated he was learner for twenty five years after which he attended to the buddha for another twenty five years chinese statue identified as likely being ānandafollowing the pāli mahīśasaka and dharmaguptaka textual traditions ānanda became monk in the second year of the buddha ministry during the buddha visit to kapilavatthu he was ordained by
