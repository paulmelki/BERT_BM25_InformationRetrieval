the messagepad is discontinued series of personal digital assistant devices developed by apple computer inc for the newton platform in some electronic engineering and the manufacture of apple messagepad devices was undertaken in japan by the sharp corporation the devices were based on the arm risc processor and all featured handwriting recognition software and were developed and marketed by apple the devices ran the newton os details screen and input with the messagepad with newton os the newton keyboard by apple became available which can also be used via the dongle on newton devices with newton interconnect port most notably the apple messagepad series as well as the apple emate newton devices featuring newton os or higher can be used with the screen turned horizontally landscape as well as vertically portrait change of setting rotates the contents of the display by or degrees handwriting recognition still works properly with the display rotated although display calibration is needed when rotation in any direction is used for the first time or when the newton device is reset emate mp handwriting recognition in initial versions newton os the handwriting recognition gave extremely mixed results for users and was sometimes inaccurate the original handwriting recognition engine was called calligrapher and was licensed from russian company called paragraph international calligrapher design was quite sophisticated it attempted to learn the user natural handwriting using database of known words to make guesses as to what the user was writing and could interpret writing anywhere on the screen whether hand printed in cursive or mix of the two by contrast palm pilot graffiti had less sophisticated design than calligrapher but was sometimes found to be more accurate and precise due to its reliance on fixed predefined stroke alphabet the stroke alphabet used letter shapes which resembled standard handwriting but which were modified to be both simple and very easy to differentiate palm computing also released two versions of graffiti for newton devices the newton version sometimes performed better and could also show strokes as they were being written as input was done on the display itself rather than on silkscreen area for editing text newton had very intuitive system for handwritten editing such as scratching out words to be deleted circling text to be selected or using written carets to mark inserts later releases of the newton operating system retained the original recognizer for compatibility but added hand printed text only not cursive recognizer called rosetta which was developed by apple included in version of the newton operating system and refined in newton rosetta is generally considered significant improvement and many reviewers testers and most users consider the newton handwriting recognition software better than any of the alternatives even years after it was introduced recognition and computation of handwritten horizontal and vertical formulas such as was also under development but never released however users wrote similar programs which could evaluate mathematical formulas using the newton os intelligent assistant unique part of every newton device the handwriting recognition and parts of the user interface for the newton are best understood in the context of the broad history of pen computing which is quite extensive vital feature of the newton handwriting recognition system is the modeless error correction that is correction done in situ without using separate window or widget using minimum of gestures if word is recognized improperly the user could double tap the word and list of alternatives would pop up in menu under the stylus most of the time the correct word will be in the list if not button at the bottom of the list allows the user to edit individual characters in that word other pen gestures could do such things as transpose letters also in situ the correction popup also allowed the user to revert to the original un recognized letter shapes this would be useful in note taking scenarios if there was insufficient time to make corrections immediately to conserve memory and storage space alternative recognition hypotheses would not be saved indefinitely if the user returned to note week later for example they would only see the best match error correction in many current handwriting systems provides such functionality but adds more steps to the process greatly increasing the interruption to user workflow that given correction requires user interface text could also be entered by tapping with the stylus on small on screen pop up qwerty virtual keyboard although more layouts were developed by users newton devices could also accept free hand sketches shapes and ink text much like desktop computer graphics tablet with shapes newton could recognize that the user was attempting to draw circle line polygon etc and it would clean them up into perfect vector representations with modifiable control points and defined vertices of what the user was attempting to draw shapes and sketches could be scaled or deformed once drawn ink text captured the user free hand writing but allowed it to be treated somewhat like recognized text when manipulating for later editing purposes ink text supported word wrap could be formatted to be bold italic etc at any time user could also direct their newton device to recognize selected ink text and turn it into recognized text deferred recognition newton note or the notes attached to each contact in names and each dates calendar or to do event could contain any mix of interleaved text ink text shapes and sketches while the newton offered handwriting recognition training and would clean up sketches into vector shapes both were unreliable and required much rewriting and redrawing the most reliable application of the newton was collecting and organizing address and phone numbers while handwritten messages could be stored they could not be easily filed sorted or searched while the technology was probable cause for the failure of the device which otherwise met or exceeded expectations the technology has been instrumental in producing the future generation of handwriting software that realizes the potential and promise that began in the development of newton
