natural bitumen from the dead sea refined asphalt the university of queensland pitch drop experiment demonstrating the viscosity of asphalt asphalt also known as bitumen is sticky black highly viscous liquid or semi solid form of petroleum it may be found in natural deposits or may be refined product and is classed as pitch before the th century the term asphaltum was also used the word is derived from the ancient greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world estimated to contain million tons is the pitch lake located in la brea in southwest trinidad within the siparia regional corporation the primary use of asphalt is in road construction where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with aggregate particles to create asphalt concrete its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products including production of roofing felt and for sealing flat roofs in material sciences and engineering the terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance although there is regional variation as to which term is most common worldwide geologists tend to favor the term bitumen for the naturally occurring material for the manufactured material which is refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils bitumen is the prevalent term in much of the world however in american english asphalt is more commonly used to help avoid confusion the phrases liquid asphalt asphalt binder or asphalt cement are used in the colloquially various forms of asphalt are sometimes referred to as tar as in the name of the la brea tar pits although tar is different material naturally occurring asphalt is sometimes specified by the term crude bitumen its viscosity is similar to that of cold molasses while the material obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil boiling at is sometimes referred to as refined bitumen the canadian province of alberta has most of the world reserves of natural asphalt in the athabasca oil sands which cover an area larger than england asphalt properties change with temperature which means that there is specific range where viscosity permits adequate compaction by providing lubrication between particles during the compaction process low temperature prevents aggregate particles from moving and the required density is not possible to achieve computer simulations of simplified model systems are able to reproduce some of asphalt characteristic properties terminology etymology the word asphalt is derived from the late middle english in turn from french asphalte based on late latin asphalton asphaltum which is the latinisation of the greek ásphaltos ásphalton word meaning asphalt bitumen pitch which perhaps derives from not without the alpha privative and sphallein to cause to fall baffle in passive err in passive be balked of the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of cement for securing or joining together various objects and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application specifically herodotus mentioned that bitumen was brought to babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall from the greek the word passed into late latin and thence into french asphalte and english asphaltum and asphalt in french the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring asphalt soaked limestone deposits and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the asphaltic concrete used to pave roads the expression bitumen originated in the sanskrit words jatu meaning pitch and jatu krit meaning pitch creating or pitch producing referring to coniferous or resinous trees the latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally gwitu men pertaining to pitch and by others pixtumens exuding or bubbling pitch which was subsequently shortened to bitumen thence passing via french into english from the same root is derived the anglo saxon word cwidu mastix the german word kitt cement or mastic and the old norse word kvada modern terminology in british english bitumen is used instead of asphalt the word asphalt is instead used to refer to asphalt concrete mixture of construction aggregate and asphalt itself also called tarmac in common parlance bitumen mixed with clay was usually called asphaltum but the term is less commonly used today in australian english the word asphalt is used to describe mix of construction aggregate bitumen refers to the liquid derived from the heavy residues from crude oil distillation in american english asphalt is equivalent to the british bitumen however asphalt is also commonly used as shortened form of asphalt concrete therefore equivalent to the british asphalt or tarmac in canadian english the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil while asphalt is used for the oil refinery product diluted bitumen diluted with naphtha to make it flow in pipelines is known as dilbit in the canadian petroleum industry while bitumen upgraded to synthetic crude oil is known as syncrude and syncrude blended with bitumen is called synbit bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi solid form of petroleum bituminous rock is form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen the oil sands of alberta canada are similar material neither of the terms asphalt or bitumen should be confused with tar or coal tars tar is the thick liquid product of the dry distillation and pyrolysis of organic hydrocarbons primarily sourced from vegetation masses whether fossilized as with coal or freshly harvested the majority of bitumen on the other hand was formed naturally when vast quantities of organic animal materials were deposited by water and buried hundreds of metres deep at the diagenetic point where the disorganized fatty hydrocarbon molecules joined together in long chains in the absence of oxygen bitumen occurs as solid or highly viscous liquid it may even be mixed in with coal deposits bitumen and coal using the bergius process can be refined into petrols such as gasoline and bitumen may be distilled into tar not the other way around composition
