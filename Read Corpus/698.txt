an illustration that shows how antigens induce the immune system response by interacting with an antibody that matches the molecular structure of an antigen in immunology an antigen ag is molecule or molecular structure such as may be present on the outside of pathogen that can be bound by an antigen specific antibody or cell antigen receptor the presence of antigens in the body normally triggers an immune response the ag abbreviation stands for an antibody generator antigens are targeted by antibodies each antibody is specifically produced by the immune system to match an antigen after cells in the immune system come into contact with it this allows precise identification or matching of the antigen and the initiation of an adaptive response the antibody is said to match the antigen in the sense that it can bind to it due to an adaptation in antigen binding fragment of the antibody in most cases an adapted antibody can only react to and bind one specific antigen in some instances however antibodies may cross react and bind more than one antigen antigens are proteins peptides amino acid chains and polysaccharides chains of monosaccharides simple sugars but lipids and nucleic acids become antigens only when combined with proteins and polysaccharides the antigen may originate from within the body self antigen or from the external environment non self the immune system identifies and attacks non self external antigens and usually does not react to self antigens due to negative selection of cells in the thymus vaccines are examples of antigens in an immunogenic form which are intentionally administered to recipient to induce the memory function of the adaptive immune system towards antigens of the pathogen invading that recipient vaccines for the seasonal flu virus is common example etymology paul ehrlich coined the term antibody in german antikörper in his side chain theory at the end of the th century in ladislas deutsch lászló detre named the hypothetical substances halfway between bacterial constituents and antibodies substances immunogenes ou antigenes antigenic or immunogenic substances he originally believed those substances to be precursors of antibodies just as zymogen is precursor of an enzyme but by he understood that an antigen induces the production of immune bodies antibodies and wrote that the word antigen is contraction of antisomatogen the oxford english dictionary indicates that the logical construction should be anti body gen terminology epitope the distinct surface features of an antigen its antigenic determinant antigenic molecules normally large biological polymers usually present surface features that can act as points of interaction for specific antibodies any such feature constitutes an epitope most antigens have the potential to be bound by multiple antibodies each of which is specific to one of the antigen epitopes using the lock and key metaphor the antigen can be seen as string of keys epitopes each of which matches different lock antibody different antibody idiotypes each have distinctly formed complementarity determining regions allergen substance capable of causing an allergic reaction the detrimental reaction may result after exposure via ingestion inhalation injection or contact with skin superantigen class of antigens that cause non specific activation of cells resulting in polyclonal cell activation and massive cytokine release tolerogen substance that invokes specific immune non responsiveness due to its molecular form if its molecular form is changed tolerogen can become an immunogen immunoglobulin binding protein proteins such as protein protein and protein that are capable of binding to antibodies at positions outside of the antigen binding site while antigens are the target of antibodies immunoglobulin binding proteins attack antibodies dependent antigen antigens that require the assistance of cells to induce the formation of specific antibodies independent antigen antigens that stimulate cells directly immunodominant antigens antigens that dominate over all others from pathogen in their ability to produce an immune response cell responses typically are directed against relatively few immunodominant epitopes although in some cases infection with the malaria pathogen plasmodium spp it is dispersed over relatively large number of parasite antigens antigen presenting cells present antigens in the form of peptides on molecules the cells selectively recognize the antigens depending on the antigen and the type of the molecule different types of cells will be activated for cell receptor tcr recognition the peptide must be processed into small fragments inside the cell and presented by major complex mhc the antigen cannot elicit the immune response without the help of an immunologic adjuvant similarly the adjuvant component of vaccines plays an essential role in the activation of the innate immune system an immunogen is an antigen substance or adduct that is able to trigger humoral innate or cell mediated immune response it first initiates an innate immune response which then causes the activation of the adaptive immune response an antigen binds the highly variable immunoreceptor products cell receptor or cell receptor once these have been generated immunogens are those antigens termed immunogenic capable of inducing an immune response at the molecular level an antigen can be characterized by its ability to bind to an antibody variable fab region different antibodies have the potential to discriminate among specific epitopes present on the antigen surface hapten is small molecule that changes the structure of an antigenic epitope in order to induce an immune response it needs to be attached to large carrier molecule such as protein complex of peptides antigens are usually carried by proteins and polysaccharides and less frequently lipids this includes parts coats capsules cell walls flagella fimbriae and toxins of bacteria viruses and other microorganisms lipids and nucleic acids are antigenic only when combined with proteins and polysaccharides non microbial non self antigens can include pollen egg white and proteins from transplanted tissues and organs or on the surface of transfused blood cells sources antigens can be classified according to their source exogenous antigens exogenous antigens are antigens that have entered the body from the outside for example by inhalation ingestion or injection the immune system response to exogenous antigens is often subclinical by endocytosis or phagocytosis exogenous
