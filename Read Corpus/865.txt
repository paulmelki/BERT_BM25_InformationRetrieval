countries that use the arabic script the arabic alphabet or or arabic abjad is the arabic script as it is codified for writing arabic it is written from right to left in cursive style and includes letters most letters have contextual letterforms the arabic script is also religious text it is used mainly in islamic countries namely in arabia north africa persia central asia and the northwestern indian subcontinent the arabic alphabet is considered an abjad meaning it only uses consonants but it is now considered an impure abjad as with other impure abjads such as the hebrew alphabet scribes later devised means of indicating vowel sounds by separate vowel diacritics consonants the basic arabic alphabet contains letters adaptations of the arabic script for other languages added and removed some letters as for persian ottoman turkish central kurdish urdu sindhi malay pashto arwi and malayalam arabi malayalam all of which have additional letters as shown below there are no distinct upper and lower case letter forms many letters look similar but are distinguished from one another by dots above or below their central part these dots are an integral part of letter since they distinguish between letters that represent different sounds for example the arabic letters and th have the same basic shape but have one dot below two dots above and three dots above respectively the letter also has the same form in initial and medial forms with one dot above though it is somewhat different in isolated and final form both printed and written arabic are cursive with most of the letters within word directly connected to the adjacent letters alphabetical order there are two main collating sequences for the arabic alphabet abjad and hija the original order used for lettering derives from the order of the phoenician alphabet and is therefore similar to the order of other phoenician derived alphabets such as the hebrew alphabet in this order letters are also used as numbers abjad numerals and possess the same alphanumeric code cipher as hebrew gematria and greek isopsephy the or order used where lists of names and words are sorted as in phonebooks classroom lists and dictionaries groups letters by similarity of shape abjadī the order is not simple historical continuation of the earlier north semitic alphabetic order since it has position corresponding to the aramaic letter samekh semkat yet no letter of the arabic alphabet historically derives from that letter loss of was compensated for by the split of shin into two independent arabic letters shīn and sīn which moved up to take the place of the six other letters that do not correspond to any north semitic letter are placed at the end common sequence this is commonly vocalized as follows another vocalization is maghrebian sequence probably older the colours indicate which letters have different positions from the previous table this can be vocalized as hijā modern dictionaries and other reference books do not use the order to sort alphabetically instead the newer order is used wherein letters are partially grouped together by similarity of shape the hijāʾī order is never used as numerals common order another kind of order was used widely in the maghreb until recently when it was replaced by the mashriqi order maghrebian order the colours indicate which letters have different positions from the previous table letter forms the arabic alphabet is always cursive and letters vary in shape depending on their position within word letters can exhibit up to four distinct forms corresponding to an initial medial middle final or isolated position imfi while some letters show considerable variations others remain almost identical across all four positions generally letters in the same word are linked together on both sides by short horizontal lines but six letters can only be linked to their preceding letter for example ararat has only isolated forms because each letter cannot be connected to its following one in addition some letter combinations are written as ligatures special shapes notably which is the only mandatory ligature the un ligated combination is considered difficult to

follow standardized scheme when transcribing names also names are regularly transcribed as pronounced locally not as pronounced in literary arabic if they were of arabic origin regarding pronunciation the phonemic values given are those of modern standard arabic which is taught in schools and universities in practice pronunciation may vary considerably from region to region for more details concerning the pronunciation of arabic consult the articles arabic phonology and varieties of arabic the names of the arabic letters can be thought of as abstractions of an older version where they
