analysis of variance anova is collection of statistical models and their associated estimation procedures such as the variation among and between groups used to analyze the differences among group means in sample anova was developed by the statistician ronald fisher the anova is based on the law of total variance where the observed variance in particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation in its simplest form anova provides statistical test of whether two or more population means are equal and therefore generalizes the test beyond two means history while the analysis of variance reached fruition in the th century antecedents extend centuries into the past according to stigler these include hypothesis testing the partitioning of sums of squares experimental techniques and the additive model laplace was performing hypothesis testing in the around laplace and gauss developed the least squares method for combining observations which improved upon methods then used in astronomy and geodesy it also initiated much study of the contributions to sums of squares laplace knew how to estimate variance from residual rather than total sum of squares by laplace was using least squares methods to address anova problems regarding measurements of atmospheric tides before astronomers had isolated observational errors resulting from reaction times the personal equation and had developed methods of reducing the errors the experimental methods used in the study of the personal equation were later accepted by the emerging field of psychology which developed strong full factorial experimental methods to which randomization and blinding were soon added an eloquent non mathematical explanation of the additive effects model was available in ronald fisher introduced the term variance and proposed its formal analysis in article the correlation between relatives on the supposition of mendelian inheritance his first application of the analysis of variance was published in analysis of variance became widely known after being included in fisher book statistical methods for research workers randomization models were developed by several researchers the first was published in polish by jerzy neyman in example no fit young vs old and short haired vs long haired fair fit pet vs working breed and less athletic vs more athleticvery good fit weight by breedthe analysis of variance can be used to describe otherwise complex relations among variables dog show provides an example dog show is not random sampling of the breed it is typically limited to dogs that are adult pure bred and exemplary histogram of dog weights from show might plausibly be rather complex like the yellow orange distribution shown in the illustrations suppose we wanted to predict the weight of dog based on certain set of characteristics of each dog one way to do that is to explain the distribution of weights by dividing the dog population into groups based on those characteristics successful grouping will split dogs such that each group has low variance of dog weights meaning the group is relatively homogeneous and the mean of each group is distinct if two groups have the same mean then it isn reasonable to conclude that the groups are in fact separate in any meaningful way in the illustrations to the right groups are identified as etc in the first illustration the dogs are divided according to the product interaction of two binary groupings young vs old and short haired vs long haired group is young short haired dogs group is young long haired dogs etc since the distributions of dog weight within each of the groups shown in blue has relatively large variance and since the means are very similar across groups grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in dog weights knowing which group dog is in doesn allow us to predict its weight much better than simply knowing the dog is in dog show thus this grouping fails to explain the variation in the overall distribution yellow orange an attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as pet vs working breed and less athletic vs more athletic would probably be somewhat more successful fair fit the heaviest show dogs are likely to be big strong working breeds while breeds kept as pets tend to be smaller and thus lighter as shown by the second illustration the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the first case and the means are more distinguishable however the significant overlap of distributions for example means that we cannot distinguish and reliably grouping dogs according to coin flip might produce distributions that look similar an attempt to explain weight by breed is likely to produce very good fit all chihuahuas are light and all st bernards are heavy the difference in weights between setters and pointers does not justify separate breeds the analysis of variance provides the formal tools to justify these intuitive judgments common use of the method is the analysis of experimental data or the development of models the method has some advantages over correlation not all of the data must be numeric and one result of the method is judgment in the confidence in an explanatory relationship background and terminology anova is form of statistical hypothesis testing heavily used in the analysis of experimental data test result calculated from the null hypothesis and the sample is called statistically significant if it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance assuming the truth of the null hypothesis statistically significant result when probability value is less than pre specified threshold significance level justifies the rejection of the null hypothesis but only if the priori probability of the null hypothesis is not high in the typical application of anova the null hypothesis is that all groups are random samples from the same population for example when studying the effect of different treatments on similar samples of patients the null hypothesis would be that all treatments have the same effect perhaps none rejecting the null hypothesis is taken to mean that the differences in observed effects between
