in mechanics acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time accelerations are vector quantities in that they have magnitude and direction the orientation of an object acceleration is given by the orientation of the net force acting on that object the magnitude of an object acceleration as described by newton second law is the combined effect of two causes the net balance of all external forces acting onto that object magnitude is directly proportional to this net resulting force that object mass depending on the materials out of which it is made magnitude is inversely proportional to the object mass the si unit for acceleration is metre per second squared for example when vehicle starts from standstill zero velocity in an inertial frame of reference and travels in straight line at increasing speeds it is accelerating in the direction of travel if the vehicle turns an acceleration occurs toward the new direction and changes its motion vector the acceleration of the vehicle in its current direction of motion is called linear or tangential during circular motions acceleration the reaction to which the passengers on board experience as force pushing them back into their seats when changing direction the effecting acceleration is called radial or orthogonal during circular motions acceleration the reaction to which the passengers experience as centrifugal force if the speed of the vehicle decreases this is an acceleration in the opposite direction and mathematically negative sometimes called deceleration and passengers experience the reaction to deceleration as an inertial force pushing them forward such negative accelerations are often achieved by retrorocket burning in spacecraft both acceleration and deceleration are treated the same they are both changes in velocity each of these accelerations tangential radial deceleration is felt by passengers until their relative differential velocity are neutralized in reference to the vehicle definition and properties kinematic quantities of classical particle mass position velocity acceleration average acceleration acceleration is the rate of change of velocity at any point on trajectory the magnitude of the acceleration is given by the rate of change of velocity in both magnitude and direction at that point the true acceleration at time is found in the limit as time interval δt of δt an object average acceleration over period of time is its change in velocity divided by the duration of the period mathematically instantaneous acceleration from bottom to top instantaneous acceleration meanwhile is the limit of the average acceleration over an infinitesimal interval of time in the terms of calculus instantaneous acceleration is the derivative of the velocity vector with respect to time as acceleration is defined as the derivative of velocity with respect to time and velocity is defined as the derivative of position with respect to time acceleration can be thought of as the second derivative of with respect to here and elsewhere if motion is in straight line vector quantities can be substituted by scalars in the equations by the fundamental theorem of calculus it can be seen that the integral of the acceleration function is the velocity function that is the area under the curve of an acceleration vs time vs graph corresponds to velocity likewise the integral of the jerk function the derivative of the acceleration function can be used to find acceleration at certain time units acceleration has the dimensions of velocity divided by time the si unit of acceleration is the metre per second squared or metre per second per second as the velocity in metres per second changes by the acceleration value every second other forms an object moving in circular motion such as satellite orbiting the earth is accelerating due to the change of direction of motion although its speed may be constant in this case it is said to be undergoing centripetal directed towards the center acceleration proper acceleration the acceleration of body relative to free fall condition is measured by an instrument called an accelerometer in classical mechanics for body with constant mass the vector acceleration of the body center of mass is proportional to the net force vector sum of all forces acting on it newton second law where is the net force acting on the body is the mass of the body and is the center of mass acceleration as speeds approach the speed of light relativistic effects become increasingly large tangential and centripetal acceleration an oscillating pendulum with velocity and acceleration marked it experiences both tangential and centripetal acceleration components of acceleration for curved motion the tangential component is due to the change in speed of traversal and points along the curve in the direction of the velocity vector or in the opposite direction the normal component also called centripetal component for circular motion is due to the change in direction of the velocity vector and is normal to the trajectory pointing toward the center of curvature of the path the velocity of particle moving on curved path as function of time can be written as with equal to the speed of travel along the path and unit vector tangent to the path pointing in the direction of motion at the chosen moment in time taking into account both the changing speed and the changing direction of the acceleration of particle moving on curved path can be written using the chain rule of differentiation for the product of two functions of time as where is the unit inward normal vector to the particle trajectory also called the principal normal and is its instantaneous radius of curvature based upon the osculating circle at time these components are called the tangential acceleration and the normal or radial acceleration or centripetal acceleration in circular motion see also circular motion and centripetal force geometrical analysis of three dimensional space curves which explains tangent principal normal and binormal is described by the frenet serret formulas special cases uniform acceleration calculation of the speed difference for uniform acceleration uniform or constant acceleration is type of motion in which the
