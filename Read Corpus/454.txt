hohenzollern albert became grand master where his skill in political administration and leadership ultimately succeeded in reversing the decline of the teutonic order but albert who was sympathetic to the demands of martin luther rebelled against the catholic church and the holy roman empire by converting the teutonic state into protestant and hereditary realm the duchy of prussia for which he paid homage to his uncle sigismund king of poland that arrangement was confirmed by the treaty of kraków in albert pledged personal oath to the king and in return was invested with the duchy for himself

to wittenberg where he was advised by martin luther to abandon the rules of his order to marry and to convert prussia into hereditary duchy for himself this proposal which was understandably appealing to albert had already been discussed by some of his relatives but it was necessary to proceed cautiously and he assured pope adrian vi that he was anxious to reform the order and punish the knights who had adopted lutheran doctrines luther for his part did not stop at the suggestion but in order to facilitate the change made special efforts to spread his teaching among the prussians while albert

fief from polish king sigismund the old painting by matejko after some delay sigismund assented to the offer with the provision that prussia should be treated as polish fiefdom and after this arrangement had been confirmed by treaty concluded at kraków albert pledged personal oath to sigismund and was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs on february the estates of the land
