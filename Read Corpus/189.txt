asteraceae or compositae commonly referred to as the aster daisy composite or sunflower family is very large and widespread family of flowering plants angiospermae the family includes over currently accepted species in over genera list in subfamilies in terms of numbers of species the asteraceae are rivaled only by the orchidaceae which is the larger family is unclear because of the uncertainty about how many extant species each family includes nearly all asteraceae bear their flowers in dense heads capitula or pseudanthia surrounded by involucral bracts when viewed from distance each capitulum may appear to be single flower enlarged outer peripheral flowers in the capitula may resemble petals and the involucral bracts may look like calyx the alternative name of the family asteraceae comes from the type genus aster from the ancient greek meaning star and refers to the star like form of the inflorescence the original name compositae is still valid under the international code of nomenclature for algae fungi and plants it refers to the composite nature of the capitula which consist of few or many individual flowers most members of asteraceae are annual or perennial herbs but significant number are also shrubs vines or trees the family has cosmopolitan distribution with species ranging from subpolar to tropical regions colonizing wide variety of habitats the largest proportion of the species occur in the arid and semiarid regions of subtropical and lower temperate latitudes the asteraceae may represent as much as of autochthonous flora in many regions of the world asteraceae is an economically important family providing products such as cooking oils leaf vegetables like lettuce sunflower seeds artichokes sweetening agents coffee substitutes and herbal teas several genera are of horticultural importance including pot marigold calendula officinalis echinacea coneflowers various daisies fleabane chrysanthemums dahlias zinnias and heleniums asteraceae are important in herbal medicine including grindelia yarrow and many others on the other hand many asteraceae are considered weeds in various circumstances of these many are invasive species in particular regions often having been introduced by human agency examples include various tumbleweeds bidens ragweeds thistles and dandelion dandelion was introduced into north america by european settlers who used the young leaves as salad green the study of this family is known as synantherology etymology and pronunciation the name asteraceae comes to international scientific vocabulary from new latin from aster the type genus aceae standardized suffix for plant family names in modern taxonomy the genus name comes from the classical latin word star which came from ancient greek star the earlier name compositae now recognized as an alternative name means composite and refers to the characteristic inflorescence special type of pseudanthium found in only few other angiosperm families the vernacular name daisy widely applied to members of this family is derived from the old english name of the daisy bellis perennis meaning day eye this is because the petals open at dawn and close at dusk distribution asteraceae species have cosmopolitan distribution and are found everywhere except antarctica and the extreme arctic they are especially numerous in tropical and subtropical regions notably central america eastern brazil the mediterranean the levant southern africa central asia and southwestern china taxonomy compositae the original name for asteraceae were first described in by the german botanist paul dietrich giseke traditionally two subfamilies were recognised asteroideae or tubuliflorae and cichorioideae or liguliflorae the latter has been shown to be extensively paraphyletic and has now been divided into subfamilies but the former still stands the phylogenetic tree presented below is based on panero funk updated in and now also includes the monotypic the diamond denotes very poorly supported node bootstrap support the dot poorly supported node the four subfamilies asteroideae cichorioideae carduoideae and mutisioideae contain of the species diversity of the whole family approximately and respectively because of the morphological complexity exhibited by this family agreeing on generic has often been difficult for taxonomists as result several of these genera have required multiple revisions characteristics members of the asteraceae are mostly herbaceous plants but some shrubs climbers and trees such as lachanodes arborea do exist they are generally easy to distinguish from other plants mainly because of their characteristic inflorescence and other shared characteristics however determining genera and species of some groups such as hieracium is notoriously difficult see damned yellow composite for example roots and stems members of the asteraceae generally produce taproots but sometimes they possess fibrous root systems stems are herbaceous aerial branched cylindrical with glandular hairs generally erect but can be prostrate to ascending some species have underground stems in the form of caudices or rhizomes these can be fleshy or woody depending on the species leaves the leaves and the stems very often contain secretory canals with resin or latex particularly common among the cichorioideae the leaves can be alternate opposite or whorled they may be simple but are often deeply lobed or otherwise incised often conduplicate or revolute the margins can be entire or lobed or toothed flowers floral heads in plants of the family asteraceae what appears to be single flower is actually cluster of much smaller flowers the overall appearance of the cluster as single flower functions in attracting pollinators in the same way as the structure of an individual flower in some other plant families the older family name compositae comes from the fact that what appears to be single flower is actually composite of smaller flowers the petals or sunrays in sunflower head are actually individual strap shaped flowers called ray flowers and the sun disk is made of smaller circular shaped individual flowers called disc flowers the word aster means star in greek referring to the appearance of some family members as star surrounded by rays the cluster of flowers that may appear to be single flower is called head the entire head may move tracking the sun like smart solar panel which maximizes reflectivity of the whole unit and can thereby attract more pollinators at the base of the head and surrounding the flowers before
