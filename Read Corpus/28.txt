animation is method in which figures are manipulated to appear as moving images in traditional animation images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film today most animations are made with computer generated imagery cgi computer animation can be very detailed animation while computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons low bandwidth or faster real time renderings other common animation methods apply stop motion technique to two and three dimensional objects like paper cutouts puppets or clay figures commonly the effect of animation is achieved by rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other the illusion as in motion pictures in general is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement but the exact causes are still uncertain analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope zoetrope flip book praxinoscope and film television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally for display on the computer techniques like animated gif and flash animation were developed animation is more pervasive than many people realize apart from short films feature films television series animated gifs and other media dedicated to the display of moving images animation is also prevalent in video games motion graphics user interfaces and visual effects the physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics in for instance moving images in magic lantern shows can also be considered animation the mechanical manipulation of three dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has very long history in automata electronic automata were popularized by disney as animatronics animators are artists who specialize in creating animation etymology the word animation stems from the latin animātiōn stem of animātiō meaning bestowing of life the primary meaning of the english word is liveliness and has been in use much longer than the meaning of moving image medium history before cinematography nr in the reworked second series of stampfer stroboscopic discs published by trentsensky vieweg in hundreds of years before the introduction of true animation people from all over the world enjoyed shows with moving figures that were created and manipulated manually in puppetry automata shadow play and the magic lantern the multi media phantasmagoria shows that were very popular in west european theatres from the late th century through the first half of the th century featured lifelike projections of moving ghosts and other frightful imagery in motion projecting praxinoscope from here shown superimposing an animated figure on separately projected background scene in the stroboscopic disc better known as the phénakisticope introduced the principle of modern animation with sequential images that were shown one by one in quick succession to form an optical illusion of motion pictures series of sequential images had occasionally been made over thousands of years but the stroboscopic disc provided the first method to represent such images in fluent motion and for the first time had artists creating series with proper systematic breakdown of movements the stroboscopic animation principle was also applied in the zoetrope the flip book and the praxinoscope the average th century animation contained about images that were displayed as continuous loop by spinning device manually the flip book often contained more pictures and had beginning and end but its animation would not last longer than few seconds the first to create much longer sequences seems to have been charles émile reynaud who between and had much success with his to minute long pantomimes lumineuses silent era when cinematography eventually broke through in after animated pictures had been known for decades the wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment animation on film was not commercialized until few years later by manufacturers of optical toys with film loops often traced from live action footage for adapted toy magic lanterns intended for kids to use at home it would take some more years before animation reached movie theatres after earlier experiments by movie pioneers stuart blackton arthur melbourne cooper segundo de chomón and edwin porter among others blackton the haunted hotel was the first huge stop motion success baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves in full photographic detail without signs of any known stage trick fantasmagorie by émile cohl émile cohl fantasmagorie is the oldest known example of what became known as traditional hand drawn animation other great artistic and very influential short films were created by ladislas starevich with his puppet animations since and by winsor mccay with detailed drawn animation in films such as little nemo and gertie the dinosaur during the the production of animated cartoons became an industry in the us successful producer john randolph bray and animator earl hurd patented the cel animation process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century felix the cat who debuted in became the first animated superstar golden age of us animation in steamboat willie featuring mickey mouse and minnie mouse popularized film with synchronized sound and put walt disney studio at the forefront of the animation industry in disney also introduced the innovation of full colour in flowers and trees as part of three year long exclusive deal with technicolor the enormous success of mickey mouse is seen as the start of the golden age of american animation that would last until the the united states dominated the world market of animation with plethora of cel animated theatrical shorts several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long lasting careers including walt disney productions goofy and donald duck warner bros cartoons looney tunes characters like daffy duck bugs bunny tweety sylvester the cat wile coyote and road runner fleischer studios paramount cartoon studios betty boop popeye superman and casper mgm cartoon studio tom and jerry and droopy walter lantz productions universal studio cartoons woody woodpecker terrytoons th century fox mighty mouse and united artists pink panther
