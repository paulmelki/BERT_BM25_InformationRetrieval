an automatic number announcement circuit anac is component of central office of telephone company that provides service to installation and service technicians to determine the telephone number of line the facility has telephone number that may be called to listen to an automatic announcement that includes the caller telephone number the anac number is useful primarily during the installation of landline telephones to quickly identify one of multiple lines operation technician calls the local telephone number of the automatic number announcement service this call is connected to equipment at local central office that uses voice synthesizer or digital samples to announce the telephone number of the line calling in the main purpose of this system is to allow telephone company technicians to identify the telephone line they are connected to automatic number announcement systems are based on automatic number identification and meant for phone company technicians the anac system works with unlisted numbers numbers with caller id blocking and numbers with no outgoing calls allowed installers of multi line business services where outgoing calls from all lines display the company main number on call display can use anac to identify specific line in the system even if cid displays every line as line one some anacs are very regional or local in scope while others are state province or area code wide there appears to be no consistent national system for them most are provider specific every telephone company whether large or small determines its own anac for each individual central office which tends to perpetuate the current situation of mess of overlapping and or spotty areas of coverage no official lists of anac numbers are published as telephone companies believe overuse of these numbers could make them more likely to be busy when needed by installers local test exchanges under the north american numbering plan almost all north american area codes reserve telephone numbers beginning with and for internal local and long distance testing respectively sometimes called plant testing one exception is winnipeg which reserves only numbers within this block are used for various test utilities such as ringback number to test the ringer when installing telephone sets milliwatt tone number simply answers with continuous test tone and loop around which connects call to another inbound call to the same or another test number anac numbers can also appear in the range but there is no requirement that they reside there in some area codes multiple additional prefixes had been reserved for test purposes in addition to the standard and many area codes reserved was also formerly reserved in bell canada territory as widespread inefficiencies in numbering such as the assignment of entire blocks of numbers to every competing carrier in every small village to support local number portability schemes have created shortages of available numbers these prefixes are often reclaimed and issued as standard exchanges moving the handful of numbers in them to one standard test exchange usually some carriers have been known to disable payphone calls to or test lines such as bell canada system wide anac line at area code conversely standard line on which voice service has been unsubscribed such as an adsl dry loop may still accept calls to the test exchange but not allow calls to standard numbers this soft disconnect condition is intended to allow calls to emergency services and to the telco business office to order telephone service but to no other numbers tollfree numbers some large telephone companies have toll free numbers set up in most cases these numbers remain undisclosed to prevent abuse but mci maintains this widely published toll free anac this is distinct from technical support and other lines which use ani so that computer can automatically display the customer account on screen pop for the next available customer service representative the mci number is intended specifically for anac use formerly some companies changed their anac number every month for secrecy this is still the case with few numbers in one example of this concern most payphones in the united states are assigned telephone number and can ring if the number is called the phone can then be used to make and receive calls by anyone making it potential tool in anonymous criminal activity such as narcotics trafficking where payphone does not have any number listed on the unit the number can be discovered by calling an anac service late in the th century after caller id and pre paid cell phone service became commonplace and with these services being more easily exploited for criminal purposes especially in the case of burner phones this type of abuse of payphones faded from concern in canada this behaviour has always been more difficult as matter of course incoming calls to payphones are disabled furthermore the bell anac number is also disabled although the telephone number is marked on the payphone itself as it is needed to report non working coin phone to repair service there are some private national toll free numbers that use ani and then have computer read back the number that is calling but these are not intended for use in identifying the customer own phone number they are used in order for the agent in the call center to confirm the phone the customer is calling from so that computer can automatically display the customer account on screen pop for the next available customer service representative they are distinct from purpose made toll free anac numbers regardless if one were to call one of these numbers listen for the number confirmation and hang up they would in effect be using this system as if it were an anac one such toll free service is one owned by mci this number us only is easy to remember and when called will read back the number after very short message suspended out of service line or an incoming only line would not be able to reach any toll free numbers anac numbers these numbers appear on various
