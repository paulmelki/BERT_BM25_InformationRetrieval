arabic numerals are the ten digits and the term often implies decimal number written using these digits in particular when contrasted with roman numerals however the term can mean the digits themselves such as in the statement octal numbers are written using arabic numerals although the hindu arabic numeral system decimal was developed by indian mathematicians around ad quite different forms for the digits were used initially they were modified into arabic numerals later in north africa it was in the algerian city of bejaia that the italian scholar fibonacci first encountered the numerals his work was crucial in making them known throughout europe european trade books and colonialism helped popularize the adoption of arabic numerals around the world the numerals have found worldwide use significantly beyond the contemporary spread of the latin alphabet intruding into the writing systems in regions where other variants of the hindu arabic numerals had been in use such as chinese and japanese writing the term arabic numerals may be intended to mean the numerals used in arabic writing such as the eastern arabic numerals the oxford english dictionary uses lowercase arabic numerals to refer to western digits and capitalized arabic numerals to refer to the eastern digits other alternative names are western arabic numerals western numerals hindu arabic numerals and unicode just uses the unadorned term digits history origins gwalior india the decimal hindu arabic numeral system was developed in india by around the development was gradual spanning several centuries but the decisive step was probably provided by brahmagupta formulation of zero as numeral in the numerals used in the bakhshali manuscript dated to sometime between the rd and th century ad the numeral system came to be known to the court of baghdad where mathematicians such as the persian al khwarizmi whose book on the calculation with hindu numerals al jam wal tafrīq bil ḥisāb al hindī was written about in arabic and then the arab mathematician al kindi who wrote four volumes on the use of the indian numerals kitāb fī isti māl al dād al hindīyyah in about their work was principally responsible for the diffusion of the indian system of numeration in the middle east and the west middle eastern mathematicians extended the decimal numeral system to include fractions as recorded in treatise by syrian mathematician abu hasan al uqlidisi in the decimal point notation was introduced by sind ibn ali who also wrote the earliest treatise on arabic numerals origin of the arabic numeral symbols according to al biruni there were multiple forms of numerals in use in india and arabs chose among them what appeared to them most useful al nasawi wrote in the early eleventh century that the mathematicians had not agreed on the form of numerals but most of them had agreed to train themselves with the forms now known as eastern arabic numerals the oldest specimens of the written numerals available from egypt in show three forms of the numeral and two forms of the numeral and these variations indicate the divergence between what later became known as the eastern arabic numerals and the western arabic numerals calculations were originally performed using dust board takht latin tabula which involved writing symbols with stylus and erasing them as part of calculations al uqlidisi then invented system of calculations with ink and paper without board and erasing bi ghayr takht wa lā maḥw bal bi dawāt wa qirṭās the use of the dust board appears to have introduced divergence in terminology as well whereas the hindu reckoning was called ḥisāb al hindī in the east it was called ḥisāb al ghubār in the west literally calculation with dust the numerals themselves were referred to in the west as ashkāl al ghubār dust figures in ibn al yāsamin or qalam al ghubår dust letters the western arabic variants of the symbols came to be used in maghreb and al andalus which are the direct ancestor of the modern arabic numerals used throughout the world the divergence in the terminology has led some scholars to propose that the western arabic numerals had separate origin in the so called ghubār numerals but the available evidence indicates no separate origin woepecke has also proposed that the western arabic numerals were already in use in spain before the arrival of the moors purportedly received via alexandria but this theory is not accepted by scholars some popular myths have argued that the original forms of these symbols indicated their numeric value through the number of angles they contained but no evidence exists of any such origin adoption in europe evolution of indian numerals into arabic numerals and their adoption in europe woodcut showing the th century astronomical clock of uppsala cathedral with two clockfaces one with arabic and one with roman numerals talhoffer thott at this time knowledge of the numerals was still widely seen as esoteric and talhoffer presents them with the hebrew alphabet and astrology late th century french revolutionary decimal clockface the reason the digits are more commonly known as arabic numerals in europe and the americas is that they were introduced to europe in the th century by arabic speakers of north africa who were then using the digits from libya to morocco arabs were also using the eastern arabic numerals in other areas in al khwārizmī wrote treatise in arabic on the calculation with hindu numerals which survives only as the th century latin translation algoritmi de numero indorum algoritmi the translator rendition of the author name gave rise to the word algorithm the first mentions of the numerals in the west are found in the codex vigilanus of from the gerbert of aurillac later pope sylvester ii used his position to spread knowledge of the numerals in europe gerbert studied in barcelona in his youth he was known to have requested mathematical treatises concerning the astrolabe
