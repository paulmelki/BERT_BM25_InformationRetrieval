in thermodynamics an adiabatic process is type of thermodynamic process which occurs without transferring heat or mass between the system and its surroundings unlike an isothermal process an adiabatic process transfers energy to the surroundings only as work it also conceptually supports the theory used to explain the first law of thermodynamics and is therefore key thermodynamic concept some chemical and physical processes occur too rapidly for energy to enter or leave the system as heat allowing convenient adiabatic approximation for example the adiabatic flame temperature uses this approximation to calculate the upper limit of flame temperature by assuming combustion loses no heat to its surroundings in meteorology and oceanography adiabatic cooling produces condensation of moisture or salinity oversaturating the parcel therefore the excess must be removed there the process becomes pseudo adiabatic process whereby the liquid water or salt that condenses is assumed to be removed upon formation by idealized instantaneous precipitation the pseudoadiabatic process is only defined for expansion because compressed parcel becomes warmer and remains undersaturated description process without transfer of heat or matter to or from system so that is called adiabatic and such system is said to be adiabatically isolated the assumption that process is adiabatic is frequently made simplifying assumption for example the compression of gas within cylinder of an engine is assumed to occur so rapidly that on the time scale of the compression process little of the system energy can be transferred out as heat to the surroundings even though the cylinders are not insulated and are quite conductive that process is idealized to be adiabatic the same can be said to be true for the expansion process of such system the assumption of adiabatic isolation is useful and often combined with other such idealizations to calculate good first approximation of system behaviour for example according to laplace when sound travels in gas there is no time for heat conduction in the medium and so the propagation of sound is adiabatic for such an adiabatic process the modulus of elasticity young modulus can be expressed as where is the ratio of specific heats at constant pressure and at constant volume and is the pressure of the gas various applications of the adiabatic assumption for closed system one may write the first law of thermodynamics as where denotes the change of the system internal energy the quantity of energy added to it as heat and the work done by the system on its surroundings if the system has such rigid walls that work cannot be transferred in or out and the walls are not adiabatic and energy is added in the form of heat and there is no phase change then the temperature of the system will rise if the system has such rigid walls that pressure volume work cannot be done but the walls are adiabatic and energy is added as isochoric work in the form of friction or the stirring of viscous fluid within the system and there is no phase change then the temperature of the system will rise if the system walls are adiabatic but not rigid and in fictive idealized process energy is added to the system in the form of frictionless non viscous pressure volume work and there is no phase change then the temperature of the system will rise such process is called an isentropic process and is said to be reversible fictively if the process were reversed the energy could be recovered entirely as work done by the system if the system contains compressible gas and is reduced in volume the uncertainty of the position of the gas is reduced and seemingly would reduce the entropy of the system but the temperature of the system will rise as the process is isentropic should the work be added in such way that friction or viscous forces are operating within the system then the process is not isentropic and if there is no phase change then the temperature of the system will rise the process is said to be irreversible and the work added to the system is not entirely recoverable in the form of work if the walls of system are not adiabatic and energy is transferred in as heat entropy is transferred into the system with the heat such process is neither adiabatic nor isentropic having and according to the second law of thermodynamics naturally occurring adiabatic processes are irreversible entropy is produced the transfer of energy as work into an adiabatically isolated system can be imagined as being of two idealized extreme kinds in one such kind no entropy is produced within the system no friction viscous dissipation etc and the work is only pressure volume work denoted by in nature this ideal kind occurs only approximately because it demands an infinitely slow process and no sources of dissipation the other extreme kind of work is isochoric work for which energy is added as work solely through friction or viscous dissipation within the system stirrer that transfers energy to viscous fluid of an adiabatically isolated system with rigid walls without phase change will cause rise in temperature of the fluid but that work is not recoverable isochoric work is irreversible the second law of thermodynamics observes that natural process of transfer of energy as work always consists at least of isochoric work and often both of these extreme kinds of work every natural process adiabatic or not is irreversible with as friction or viscosity are always present to some extent adiabatic heating and cooling the adiabatic compression of gas causes rise in temperature of the gas adiabatic expansion against pressure or spring causes drop in temperature in contrast free expansion is an isothermal process for an ideal gas adiabatic heating occurs when the pressure of gas is increased by work done on it by its surroundings piston compressing gas contained within cylinder and raising the temperature where in many practical situations heat conduction through walls can be slow compared with the compression time this
