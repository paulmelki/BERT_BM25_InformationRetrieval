px unicode representing ram horns it is one of the constellations described by the nd century astronomer ptolemy and remains one of the modern constellations it is mid sized constellation ranking th overall size with an area of square degrees of the celestial sphere although aries came to represent specifically the ram whose fleece became the golden fleece of ancient greek mythology it has represented ram since late babylonian times before that the stars of aries formed farmhand different cultures have incorporated the stars of aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in china and porpoise in the marshall islands aries is relatively dim constellation possessing only four bright stars hamal alpha arietis second magnitude sheratan beta arietis third magnitude mesarthim gamma arietis fourth magnitude and arietis also fourth magnitude the few deep sky objects within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies several meteor showers appear to radiate from aries including the daytime arietids and the epsilon arietids history and mythology aries is recognized as an official constellation now albeit as specific region of the sky by the international astronomical union it was originally defined in ancient texts as specific pattern of stars and has remained constellation since ancient times it now includes the ancient pattern as well as the surrounding stars in the description of the babylonian zodiac given in the clay tablets known as the mul apin the constellation now known as aries was the final station along the ecliptic the mul apin was comprehensive table of the risings and settings of stars which likely served as an agricultural calendar modern day aries was known as the agrarian worker or the hired man although likely compiled in the th or th century bc the mul apin reflects tradition which marks the pleiades as the vernal equinox which was the case with some precision at the beginning of the middle bronze age the earliest identifiable reference to aries as distinct constellation comes from the boundary stones that date from to bc on several boundary stones zodiacal ram figure is distinct from the other characters present the shift in identification from the constellation as the agrarian worker to the ram likely occurred in later babylonian tradition because of its growing association with dumuzi the shepherd by the time the mul apin was created by bc modern aries was identified with both dumuzi ram and hired laborer the exact timing of this shift is difficult to determine due to the lack of images of aries or other ram figures in ancient egyptian astronomy aries was associated with the god amon ra who was depicted as man with ram head and represented fertility and creativity because it was the location of the vernal equinox it was called the indicator of the reborn sun during the times of the year when aries was prominent priests would process statues of amon ra to temples practice that was modified by persian astronomers centuries later aries acquired the title of lord of the head in egypt referring to its symbolic and mythological importance aries and musca borealis as depicted in urania mirror set of constellation cards published in london aries depicted in an early medieval manuscript aries was not fully accepted as constellation until classical times in hellenistic astrology the constellation of aries is associated with the golden ram of greek mythology that rescued phrixus and helle on orders from hermes taking phrixus to the land of colchis phrixos and helle were the son and daughter of king athamas and his first wife nephele the king second wife ino was jealous and wished to kill his children to accomplish this she induced famine in boeotia then falsified message from the oracle of delphi that said phrixos must be sacrificed to end the famine athamas was about to sacrifice his son atop mount laphystium when aries sent by nephele arrived helle fell off of aries back in flight and drowned in the dardanelles also called the hellespont in her honor after arriving phrixus sacrificed the ram to zeus and gave the fleece to aeëtes of colchis who rewarded him with an engagement to his daughter chalciope aeëtes hung its skin in sacred place where it became known as the golden fleece and was guarded by dragon in later myth this golden fleece was stolen by jason and the argonauts historically aries has been depicted as crouched wingless ram with its head turned towards taurus ptolemy asserted in his almagest that hipparchus depicted alpha arietis as the ram muzzle though ptolemy did not include it in his constellation figure instead it was listed as an unformed star and denoted as the star over the head john flamsteed in his atlas coelestis followed ptolemy description by mapping it above the figure head flamsteed followed the general convention of maps by depicting aries lying down astrologically aries has been associated with the head and its humors it was strongly associated with mars both the planet and the god it was considered to govern western europe and syria and to indicate strong temper in person the first point of aries the location of the vernal equinox is named for the constellation this is because the sun crossed the celestial equator from south to north in aries more than two millennia ago hipparchus defined it in bc as point south of gamma arietis because of the precession of the equinoxes the first point of aries has since moved into pisces and will move into aquarius by around ad the sun now appears in aries from late april through mid may though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring medieval muslim astronomers depicted aries in various ways astronomers like al sufi saw the constellation as ram
