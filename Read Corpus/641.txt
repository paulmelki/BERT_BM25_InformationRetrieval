an antibiotic is type of antimicrobial substance active against bacteria it is the most important type of antibacterial agent for fighting bacterial infections and antibiotic medications are widely used in the treatment and prevention of such infections they may either kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria limited number of antibiotics also possess antiprotozoal activity antibiotics are not effective against viruses such as the common cold or influenza drugs which inhibit viruses are termed antiviral drugs or antivirals rather than antibiotics sometimes the term antibiotic literally opposing life from the greek roots ἀντι anti against and βίος bios life is broadly used to refer to any substance used against microbes but in the usual medical usage antibiotics such as penicillin are those produced naturally by one microorganism fighting another whereas nonantibiotic antibacterials such as sulfonamides and antiseptics are fully synthetic however both classes have the same goal of killing or preventing the growth of microorganisms and both are included in antimicrobial chemotherapy antibacterials include antiseptic drugs antibacterial soaps and chemical disinfectants whereas antibiotics are an important class of antibacterials used more specifically in medicine and sometimes in livestock feed antibiotics have been used since ancient times many civilizations used topical application of mouldy bread with many references to its beneficial effects arising from ancient egypt nubia china serbia greece and rome the first person to directly document the use of molds to treat infections was john parkinson antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the th century alexander fleming discovered modern day penicillin in the widespread use of which proved significantly beneficial during wartime however the effectiveness and easy access to antibiotics have also led to their overuse and some bacteria have evolved resistance to them the world health organization has classified antimicrobial resistance as widespread serious threat that is no longer prediction for the future it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone of any age in any country medical uses antibiotics are used to treat or prevent bacterial infections and sometimes protozoan infections metronidazole is effective against number of parasitic diseases when an infection is suspected of being responsible for an illness but the responsible pathogen has not been identified an empiric therapy is adopted this involves the administration of broad spectrum antibiotic based on the signs and symptoms presented and is initiated pending laboratory results that can take several days when the responsible pathogenic microorganism is already known or has been identified definitive therapy can be started this will usually involve the use of narrow spectrum antibiotic the choice of antibiotic given will also be based on its cost identification is critically important as it can reduce the cost and toxicity of the antibiotic therapy and also reduce the possibility of the emergence of antimicrobial resistance to avoid surgery antibiotics may be given for non complicated acute appendicitis antibiotics may be given as preventive measure and this is usually limited to at risk populations such as those with weakened immune system particularly in hiv cases to prevent pneumonia those taking drugs cancer patients and those having surgery their use in surgical procedures is to help prevent infection of incisions they have an important role in dental antibiotic prophylaxis where their use may prevent bacteremia and consequent infective endocarditis antibiotics are also used to prevent infection in cases of neutropenia particularly cancer related administration there are many different routes of administration for antibiotic treatment antibiotics are usually taken by mouth in more severe cases particularly deep seated systemic infections antibiotics can be given intravenously or by injection where the site of infection is easily accessed antibiotics may be given topically in the form of eye drops onto the conjunctiva for conjunctivitis or ear drops for ear infections and acute cases of swimmer ear topical use is also one of the treatment options for some skin conditions including acne and cellulitis advantages of topical application include achieving high and sustained concentration of antibiotic at the site of infection reducing the potential for systemic absorption and toxicity and total volumes of antibiotic required are reduced thereby also reducing the risk of antibiotic misuse topical antibiotics applied over certain types of surgical wounds have been reported to reduce the risk of surgical site infections however there are certain general causes for concern with topical administration of antibiotics some systemic absorption of the antibiotic may occur the quantity of antibiotic applied is difficult to accurately dose and there is also the possibility of local reactions or contact dermatitis occurring it is recommended to administer antibiotics as soon as possible especially in life threatening infections many emergency departments stock antibiotics for this purpose prevalence antibiotic consumption varies widely between countries the who report on surveillance of antibiotic consumption published in analysed data from countries as measured in defined daily doses per inhabitants per day mongolia had the highest consumption with rate of burundi had the lowest at amoxicillin and amoxicillin clavulanic acid were the most frequently consumed side effects health advocacy messages such as this one encourage patients to talk with their doctor about safety in using antibiotics antibiotics are screened for any negative effects before their approval for clinical use and are usually considered safe and well tolerated however some antibiotics have been associated with wide extent of adverse side effects ranging from mild to very severe depending on the type of antibiotic used the microbes targeted and the individual patient side effects may reflect the pharmacological or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or may involve or allergic reactions adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have long history of use common side effects include diarrhea resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora resulting for example in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria such as clostridium difficile taking probiotics during the course of antibiotic treatment can help prevent antibiotic
