alfred bernhard nobel october december was swedish chemist engineer inventor businessman and philanthropist he held different patents dynamite being the most famous he owned bofors which he redirected from its previous role as primarily an iron and steel producer to major manufacturer of cannon and other armaments having read premature obituary which condemned him for profiting from the sales of arms he bequeathed his fortune to the nobel prize institution the synthetic element nobelium was named after him in the second half of the th century his name also survives in companies such as dynamit nobel and akzonobel which are descendants of mergers with companies that nobel established life and career alfred nobel at young age in the born in stockholm alfred nobel was the third son of immanuel nobel an inventor and engineer and karolina andriette ahlsell nobel the couple married in and had eight children the family was impoverished and only alfred and his three brothers survived past childhood through his father alfred nobel was descendant of the swedish scientist olaus rudbeck and in his turn the boy was interested in engineering particularly explosives learning the basic principles from his father at young age alfred nobel interest in technology was inherited from his father an alumnus of royal institute of technology in stockholm following various business failures nobel father moved to saint petersburg in and grew successful there as manufacturer of machine tools and explosives he invented the veneer lathe which allowed the production of modern plywood and started work on the torpedo in the family joined him in the city now prosperous his parents were able to send nobel to private tutors and the boy excelled in his studies particularly in chemistry and languages achieving fluency in english french german and russian for months from to nobel went to the only school he ever attended as child in stockholm as young man nobel studied with chemist nikolai zinin then in went to paris to further the work there he met ascanio sobrero who had invented nitroglycerin three years before sobrero strongly opposed the use of nitroglycerin as it was unpredictable exploding when subjected to heat or pressure but nobel became interested in finding way to control and use nitroglycerin as commercially usable explosive as it had much more power than gunpowder in at age he went to the united states for one year to study working for short period under swedish american inventor john ericsson who designed the american civil war ironclad uss monitor nobel filed his first patent an english patent for gas meter in while his first swedish patent which he received in was on ways to prepare gunpowder the family factory produced armaments for the crimean war but had difficulty switching back to regular domestic production when the fighting ended and they filed for bankruptcy in nobel father left his factory in the care of the second son ludvig nobel who greatly improved the business nobel and his parents returned to sweden from russia and nobel devoted himself to the study of explosives and especially to the safe manufacture and use of nitroglycerin nobel invented detonator in and in designed the blasting cap on september shed used for preparation of nitroglycerin exploded at the factory in heleneborg stockholm sweden killing five people including nobel younger brother emil fazed by the accident nobel founded the company nitroglycerin aktiebolaget ab in vinterviken so that he could continue to work in more isolated area nobel invented dynamite in substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable nitroglycerin dynamite was patented in the us and the uk and was used extensively in mining and the building of transport networks internationally in nobel invented gelignite more stable and powerful than dynamite and in patented ballistite predecessor of cordite nobel was elected member of the royal swedish academy of sciences in the same institution that would later select laureates for two of the nobel prizes and he received an honorary doctorate from uppsala university in alfred nobel death mask at björkborn nobel residence in karlskoga sweden nobel brothers ludvig and robert founded the oil company branobel and became hugely rich in their own right nobel invested in these and amassed great wealth through the development of these new oil regions during his life nobel was issued patents internationally and by his death his business had established more than armaments factories despite his apparently pacifist character in the death of his brother ludvig caused several newspapers to publish obituaries of alfred in error one french newspaper published an obituary titled le marchand de la mort est mort the merchant of death is dead nobel read the obituary and was appalled at the idea that he would be remembered in this way his decision to posthumously donate the majority of his wealth to found the nobel prize has been credited at least in part to him wanting to leave behind better legacy inventions portrait of nobel by gösta florman nobel found that when nitroglycerin was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like kieselguhr diatomaceous earth it became safer and more convenient to handle and this mixture he patented in as dynamite nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year at quarry in redhill surrey england in order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with dangerous explosives nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance nobel safety powder but settled with dynamite instead referring to the greek word for power nobel later combined nitroglycerin with various nitrocellulose compounds similar to collodion but settled on more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive and obtained transparent jelly like substance which was more powerful explosive than dynamite gelignite or blasting gelatine as it was named was patented in and was followed by host of similar combinations modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances gelignite was more stable transportable and conveniently formed to fit into bored holes
