allosaurus is genus of large carnivorous theropod dinosaur that lived to million years ago during the late jurassic period kimmeridgian to late tithonian the name allosaurus means different lizard alluding to its unique concave vertebrae at the time of its discovery it is derived from the greek different other and lizard generic reptile the first fossil remains that could definitively be ascribed to this genus were described in by paleontologist othniel charles marsh as one of the first well known theropod dinosaurs it has long attracted attention outside of paleontological circles allosaurus was large bipedal predator its skull was light robust and equipped with dozens of sharp serrated teeth it averaged in length though fragmentary remains suggest it could have reached over relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs its three fingered forelimbs were small and the body was balanced by long and heavily muscled tail it is classified as an allosaurid type of carnosaurian theropod dinosaur the genus has complicated taxonomy and includes three valid species the best known of which is fragilis the bulk of allosaurus remains have come from north america morrison formation with material also known from portugal it was known for over half of the th century as antrodemus but study of the copious remains from the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry brought the name allosaurus back to prominence and established it as one of the best known dinosaurs as the most abundant large predator in the morrison formation allosaurus was at the top of the food chain probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs and perhaps other predators potential prey included ornithopods stegosaurids and sauropods some paleontologists interpret allosaurus as having had cooperative social behavior and hunting in packs while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses description the size range of allosaurus compared with human allosaurus was typical large theropod having massive skull on short neck long slightly sloping tail and reduced forelimbs allosaurus fragilis the best known species had an average length of with the largest definitive allosaurus specimen amnh estimated at long and an estimated weight of in his monograph on allosaurus james madsen mentioned range of bone sizes which he interpreted to show maximum length of as with dinosaurs in general weight estimates are debatable and since have ranged between and for modal adult weight not maximum john foster specialist on the morrison formation suggests that is reasonable for large adults of fragilis but that is closer estimate for individuals represented by the average sized thigh bones he has measured using the subadult specimen nicknamed big al since assigned to the species allosaurus jimmadseni researchers using computer modelling arrived at best estimate of for the individual but by varying parameters they found range from approximately to approximately jimmadseni skeletal reconstruction several gigantic specimens have been attributed to allosaurus but may in fact belong to other genera the closely related genus saurophaganax omnh reached perhaps in length and its single species has sometimes been included in the genus allosaurus as allosaurus maximus though recent studies support it as separate genus another potential specimen of allosaurus once assigned to the genus epanterias amnh may have measured in length more recent discovery is partial skeleton from the peterson quarry in morrison rocks of new mexico this large allosaurid may be another individual of saurophaganax david smith examining allosaurus fossils by quarry found that the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry utah specimens are generally smaller than those from como bluff wyoming or brigham young university dry mesa quarry colorado but the shapes of the bones themselves did not vary between the sites later study by smith incorporating garden park colorado and dinosaur national monument utah specimens found no justification for multiple species based on skeletal variation skull variation was most common and was gradational suggesting individual variation was responsible further work on size related variation again found no consistent differences although the dry mesa material tended to clump together on the basis of the astragalus an ankle bone kenneth carpenter using skull elements from the cleveland lloyd site found wide variation between individuals calling into question previous species level distinctions based on such features as the shape of the horns and the proposed differentiation of jimmadseni based on the shape of the jugal skull jimmadseni skull with diagram highlighting individual bones the skull and teeth of allosaurus were modestly proportioned for theropod of its size paleontologist gregory paul gives length of for skull belonging to an individual he estimates at long each premaxilla the bones that formed the tip of the snout held five teeth with shaped cross sections and each maxilla the main tooth bearing bones in the upper jaw had between and teeth the number of teeth does not exactly correspond to the size of the bone each dentary the tooth bearing bone of the lower jaw had between and teeth with an average count of the teeth became shorter narrower and more curved toward the back of the skull all of the teeth had saw like edges they were shed easily and were replaced continually making them common fossils its skull was light robust and equipped with dozens of sharp serrated teeth its skull averaged long but could possibly reach the skull had pair of horns above and in front of the eyes these horns were composed of extensions of the lacrimal bones and varied in shape and size there were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the nasal bones that led into the horns the horns were probably covered in keratin sheath and may have had variety of functions including acting as sunshades for the eyes being used for display and being used in combat against other members of the same species although they were fragile there was ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment as is also seen in tyrannosaurids inside the lacrimal
