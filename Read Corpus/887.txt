to operate its steam locomotives on atlantic street west of fifth avenue then parmentier garden gowanus lane all the way to brooklyn south ferry the present location of brooklyn pier prior to the cut being built the lirr western terminus was atlantic street at clinton street train cars were hauled by teams of horses along atlantic street from clinton street to parmentier garden where steam locomotives were attached while the cut was being built the railroad operated to temporary terminal at pacific street and henry street the cobble hill tunnel was part of the first rail link between new york city and boston massachusetts the railroad connected lower manhattan via the south ferry to greenport on the north fork of long island where ferry connected to stonington connecticut where rail link continued to boston this avoided some difficult construction of bridges over the rivers of southern connecticut in the new york and new haven railroad line was completed through connecticut

utterly forgotten with all its reminiscences however there will for few years yet be many dear ones to not few brooklynites new yorkers and promiscuous crowds besides for it was here you started to go down the island in summer for years it was confidently counted on that this spot and the railroad of which it was the terminus were going to prove the permanent seat of business and wealth that belong
