alessandro giuseppe antonio anastasio volta february march was an italian physicist chemist and pioneer of electricity and power who is credited as the inventor of the electric battery and the discoverer of methane he invented the voltaic pile in and reported the results of his experiments in in two part letter to the president of the royal society with this invention volta proved that electricity could be generated chemically and debunked the prevalent theory that electricity was generated solely by living beings volta invention sparked great amount of scientific excitement and led others to conduct similar experiments which eventually led to the development of the field of volta also drew admiration from napoleon bonaparte for his invention and was invited to the institute of france to demonstrate his invention to the members of the institute volta enjoyed certain amount of closeness with the emperor throughout his life and he was conferred numerous honours by him volta held the chair of experimental physics at the university of pavia for nearly years and was widely idolised by his students despite his professional success volta tended to be person inclined towards domestic life and this was more apparent in his later years at this time he tended to live secluded from public life and more for the sake of his family until his eventual death in from series of illnesses which began in the si unit of electric potential is named in his honour as the volt early life and works volta was born in como town in present day northern italy on february in volta married an aristocratic lady also from como teresa peregrini with whom he raised three sons zanino flaminio and luigi his father filippo volta was of noble lineage his mother donna maddalena came from the family of the inzaghis in he became professor of physics at the royal school in como year later he improved and popularised the electrophorus device that produced static electricity his promotion of it was so extensive that he is often credited with its invention even though machine operating on the same principle was described in by the swedish experimenter johan wilcke in he travelled through switzerland there he befriended de saussure in the years between and volta studied the chemistry of gases he researched and discovered methane after reading paper by benjamin franklin of the united states on flammable air in november he found methane at lake maggiore and by he managed to isolate methane he devised experiments such as the ignition of methane by an electric spark in closed vessel volta also studied what we now call electrical capacitance developing separate means to study both electrical potential and charge and discovering that for given object they are proportional this is called volta law of capacitance and for this work the unit of electrical potential has been named the volt in he became professor of experimental physics at the university of pavia chair that he occupied for almost years volta and galvani luigi galvani volta rival luigi galvani an italian physicist discovered something he named animal electricity when two different metals were connected in series with frog leg and to one another volta realised that the frog leg served as both conductor of electricity what we would now call an electrolyte and as detector of electricity he also understood that the frog legs were irrelevant to the electric current which was caused by the two differing metals he replaced the frog leg with brine soaked paper and detected the flow of electricity by other means familiar to him from his previous studies in this way he discovered the electrochemical series and the law that the electromotive force emf of galvanic cell consisting of pair of metal electrodes separated by electrolyte is the difference between their two electrode potentials thus two identical electrodes and common electrolyte give zero net emf this may be called volta law of the electrochemical series in as the result of professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by galvani volta invented the voltaic pile an early electric battery which produced steady electric current volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was zinc and copper initially he experimented with individual cells in series each cell being wine goblet filled with brine into which the two dissimilar electrodes were dipped the voltaic pile replaced the goblets with cardboard soaked in brine early battery voltaic pile in announcing his discovery of the voltaic pile volta paid tribute to the influences of william nicholson tiberius cavallo and abraham bennet the battery made by volta is credited as one of the first electrochemical cells it consists of two electrodes one made of zinc the other of copper the electrolyte is either sulfuric acid mixed with water or form of saltwater brine the electrolyte exists in the form and so zinc metal which is higher in the electrochemical series than both copper and hydrogen is oxidized to zinc cations zn and creates electrons that move to the copper electrode the positively charged hydrogen ions protons capture electrons from the copper electrode forming bubbles of hydrogen gas this makes the zinc rod the negative electrode and the copper rod the positive electrode thus there are two terminals and an electric current will flow if they are connected the chemical reactions in this voltaic cell are as follows zinc zn zn sulfuric acid copper metal does not react but rather it functions as an electrode for the electric current sulfate anion so does not undergo any chemical reaction either but migrates to the zinc anode to compensate for the charge of the zinc cations formed there however this cell also has some disadvantages it is unsafe to handle since sulfuric acid even if diluted can be hazardous also the power of the cell diminishes over time because the hydrogen gas is not released instead it accumulates on the surface of the copper electrode and forms barrier between the metal and
