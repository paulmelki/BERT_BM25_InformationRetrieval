in modern physics antimatter is defined as matter that is composed of the antiparticles or partners of the corresponding particles of ordinary matter minuscule numbers of antiparticles are generated daily at particle accelerators total production has been only few nanograms ng and in natural processes like cosmic ray collisions and some types of radioactive decay but only tiny fraction of these have successfully been bound together in experiments to form anti atoms no macroscopic amount of antimatter has ever been assembled due to the extreme cost and difficulty of production and handling theoretically particle and its anti particle for example proton and an antiproton have the same mass but opposite electric charge and other differences in quantum numbers for example proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge collision between any particle and its anti particle partner leads to their mutual annihilation giving rise to various proportions of intense photons gamma rays neutrinos and sometimes less massive pairs the majority of the total energy of annihilation emerges in the form of ionizing radiation if surrounding matter is present the energy content of this radiation will be absorbed and converted into other forms of energy such as heat or light the amount of energy released is usually proportional to the total mass of the collided matter and antimatter in accordance with the notable mass energy equivalence equation antimatter particles bind with each other to form antimatter just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter for example positron the antiparticle of the electron and an antiproton the antiparticle of the proton can form an antihydrogen atom the nuclei of antihelium have been artificially produced albeit with difficulty and are the most complex anti nuclei so far observed physical principles indicate that complex antimatter atomic nuclei are possible as well as anti atoms corresponding to the known chemical elements there is strong evidence that the observable universe is composed almost entirely of ordinary matter as opposed to an equal mixture of matter and antimatter this asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe is one of the great unsolved problems in physics the process by which this inequality between matter and antimatter particles developed is called baryogenesis definitions antimatter particles can be defined by their negative baryon number or lepton number while normal non antimatter matter particles have positive baryon or lepton number these two classes of particles are the antiparticle partners of each other positron is the antimatter equivalent of the electron the french term contra terrene led to the initialism and the science fiction term seetee as used in such novels as seetee ship conceptual history the idea of negative matter appears in past theories of matter that have now been abandoned using the once popular vortex theory of gravity the possibility of matter with negative gravity was discussed by william hicks in the between the and the karl pearson proposed the existence of squirts and sinks of the flow of aether the squirts represented normal matter and the sinks represented negative matter pearson theory required fourth dimension for the aether to flow from and into the term antimatter was first used by arthur schuster in two rather whimsical letters to nature in in which he coined the term he hypothesized antiatoms as well as whole antimatter solar systems and discussed the possibility of matter and antimatter annihilating each other schuster ideas were not serious theoretical proposal merely speculation and like the previous ideas differed from the modern concept of antimatter in that it possessed negative gravity the modern theory of antimatter began in with paper by paul dirac dirac realised that his relativistic version of the schr√∂dinger wave equation for electrons predicted the possibility of antielectrons these were discovered by carl anderson in and named positrons portmanteau of positive electron although dirac did not himself use the term antimatter its use follows on naturally enough from antielectrons antiprotons etc complete periodic table of antimatter was envisaged by charles janet in the feynman stueckelberg interpretation states that antimatter and antiparticles are regular particles traveling backward in time notation one way to denote an antiparticle is by adding bar over the particle symbol for example the proton and antiproton are denoted as and respectively the same rule applies if one were to address particle by its constituent components proton is made up of quarks so an antiproton must therefore be formed from antiquarks another convention is to distinguish particles by their electric charge thus the electron and positron are denoted simply as and respectively to prevent confusion however the two conventions are never mixed properties theorized anti gravitational properties of antimatter are currently being tested at the alpha experiment at cern antimatter coming in contact with matter will annihilate both while leaving behind pure energy research is needed to study the possible gravitational effects between matter and antimatter and antimatter and antimatter however research is difficult considering when the two meet they annihilate along with the current difficulties of capturing and containing antimatter there are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges such as electric and baryon charges matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties this means particle and its corresponding antiparticle must have identical masses and decay lifetimes if unstable it also implies that for example star made up of antimatter an antistar will shine just like an ordinary star this idea was tested experimentally in by the alpha experiment which measured the transition between the two lowest energy states of antihydrogen the results which are identical to that of hydrogen confirmed the validity of quantum mechanics for antimatter origin and asymmetry most matter observable from the earth seems to be made of matter rather than antimatter if antimatter dominated regions of space existed the gamma rays produced in annihilation reactions along the boundary between matter and antimatter regions would be detectable antiparticles are created everywhere in the universe where high energy particle collisions take
