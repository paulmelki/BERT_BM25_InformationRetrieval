augustin jean fresnel or may july was french civil engineer and physicist whose research in optics led to the almost unanimous acceptance of the wave theory of light excluding any remnant of newton corpuscular theory from the late until the end of the th century he is perhaps better known for inventing the catadioptric reflective refractive fresnel lens and for pioneering the use of stepped lenses to extend the visibility of lighthouses saving countless lives at sea the simpler dioptric purely refractive stepped lens first proposed by count buffon and independently reinvented by fresnel is used in screen magnifiers and in condenser lenses for overhead projectors by expressing huygens principle of secondary waves and young principle of interference in quantitative terms and supposing that simple colors consist of sinusoidal waves fresnel gave the first satisfactory explanation of diffraction by straight edges including the first satisfactory wave based explanation of rectilinear propagation part of his argument was proof that the addition of sinusoidal functions of the same frequency but different phases is analogous to the addition of forces with different directions by further supposing that light waves are purely transverse fresnel explained the nature of polarization the mechanism of chromatic polarization and the transmission and reflection coefficients at the interface between two transparent isotropic media then by generalizing the direction speed polarization relation for calcite he accounted for the directions and polarizations of the refracted rays in doubly refractive crystals of the biaxial class those for which huygens secondary wavefronts are not axisymmetric the period between the first publication of his pure transverse wave hypothesis and the submission of his first correct solution to the biaxial problem was less than year later he coined the terms linear polarization circular polarization and elliptical polarization explained how optical rotation could be understood as difference in propagation speeds for the two directions of circular polarization and by allowing the reflection coefficient to be complex accounted for the change in polarization due to total internal reflection as exploited in the fresnel rhomb defenders of the established corpuscular theory could not match his quantitative explanations of so many phenomena on so few assumptions fresnel had lifelong battle with tuberculosis to which he succumbed at the age of although he did not become public celebrity in his lifetime he lived just long enough to receive due recognition from his peers including on his deathbed the rumford medal of the royal society of london and his name is ubiquitous in the modern terminology of optics and waves after the wave theory of light was subsumed by maxwell electromagnetic theory in the some attention was diverted from the magnitude of fresnel contribution in the period between fresnel unification of physical optics and maxwell wider unification contemporary authority humphrey lloyd described fresnel transverse wave theory as the noblest fabric which has ever adorned the domain of physical science newton system of the universe alone excepted early life broglie facing rue jean françois mérimée inaugurated on september the inscription when translated says augustin fresnel engineer of bridges and roads member of the academy of sciences creator of lenticular lighthouses was born in this house on may the theory of light owes to this emulator of newton the highest concepts and the most useful applications family augustin jean fresnel also called augustin jean or simply augustin born in broglie normandy on may was the second of four sons of the architect jacques fresnel and his wife augustine née mérimée in following the revolution broglie became part of the département of eure the family moved twice in to cherbourg and in to jacques home town of mathieu where madame fresnel would spend years as widow outliving two of her sons the first son louis was admitted to the école polytechnique became lieutenant in the artillery and was killed in action at jaca spain the day before his rd birthday the third léonor followed augustin into civil engineering succeeded him as secretary of the lighthouse commission and helped to edit his collected works the fourth fulgence fresnel became noted linguist diplomat and orientalist and occasionally assisted augustin with negotiations léonor apparently was the only one of the four who married their mother younger brother jean françois léonor mérimée father of the writer prosper mérimée was paint artist who turned his attention to the chemistry of painting he became the permanent secretary of the école des beaux arts and until professor at the école polytechnique and was the initial point of contact between augustin and the leading optical physicists of the day education the fresnel brothers were initially home schooled by their mother the sickly augustin was considered the slow one not inclined to memorization but the popular story that he hardly began to read until the age of eight is disputed at the age of nine or ten he was undistinguished except for his ability to turn tree branches into toy bows and guns that worked far too well earning himself the title homme de génie the man of genius from his accomplices and united crackdown from their elders in augustin was sent to the école centrale at caen as company for louis but augustin lifted his performance in late he was accepted into the école polytechnique being placed th in the entrance examination as the detailed records of the école polytechnique begin in we know little of augustin time there except that he made few if any friends and in spite of continuing poor health excelled in drawing and geometry in his first year he took prize for his solution to geometry problem posed by adrien marie legendre graduating in he then enrolled at the école nationale des ponts et chaussées national school of bridges and roads also known as enpc or école des ponts from which he graduated in entering the service of the corps des ponts et chaussées as an ingénieur ordinaire aspirant ordinary engineer in training directly or indirectly he was to remain in the employment of the corps des
