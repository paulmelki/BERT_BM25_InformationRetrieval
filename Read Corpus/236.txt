carrel in alexis carrel june november was french surgeon and biologist who was awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in for pioneering vascular suturing techniques he invented the first perfusion pump with charles lindbergh opening the way to organ transplantation his positive description of miraculous healing he witnessed during pilgrimage earned him scorn of some of his colleagues this prompted him to relocate to the united states where he lived most of his life he had leading role in implementing eugenic policies in vichy france nobel prize laureate in alexis carrel was also elected twice in and as an honorary member of the academy of sciences of the ussr biography born in sainte foy lès lyon rhône carrel was raised in devout catholic family and was educated by jesuits though he had become an agnostic by the time he became university student he was pioneer in transplantology and thoracic surgery alexis carrel was also member of learned societies in the spain russia sweden the netherlands belgium france vatican city germany italy and greece and received honorary doctorates from queen university of belfast princeton university california new york brown university and columbia university in he was claimed to have witnessed the miraculous cure of marie bailly at lourdes made famous in part because she named carrel as witness of her cure after the notoriety surrounding the event carrel could not obtain hospital appointment because of the pervasive anticlericalism in the french university system at the time in he emigrated to montreal canada but soon relocated to chicago illinois to work for hull laboratory while there he collaborated with american physician charles claude guthrie in work on vascular suture and the transplantation of blood vessels and organs as well as the head and carrel was awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for these efforts in he joined the newly formed rockefeller institute of medical research in new york where he spent the rest of his career there he did significant work on tissue cultures with pathologist montrose thomas burrows in the carrel and charles lindbergh became close friends not only because of the years they worked together but also because they shared personal political and social views lindbergh initially sought out carrel to see if his sister in law heart damaged by rheumatic fever could be repaired when lindbergh saw the crudeness of carrel machinery he offered to build new equipment for the scientist eventually they built the first perfusion pump an invention instrumental to the development of organ transplantation and open heart surgery lindbergh considered carrel his closest friend and said he would preserve and promote carrel ideals after his death due to his close proximity with jacques doriot fascist parti populaire français ppf during the and his role in implementing eugenics policies during vichy france he was accused after the liberation of collaboration but died before the trial in his later life he returned to his catholic roots in he met with trappist monk alexis presse on recommendation although carrel was skeptical about meeting with priest presse ended up having profound influence on the rest of carrel life in he said believe in the existence of god in the immortality of the soul in revelation and in all the catholic church teaches he summoned presse to administer the catholic sacraments on his death bed in november for much of his life carrel and his wife spent their summers on the which they owned after he and lindbergh became close friends carrel persuaded him to also buy neighboring island the ile illiec where the lindberghs often resided in the late contributions to science vascular suture carrel was young surgeon in when the french president sadi carnot was assassinated with knife carnot bled to death due to severing of his portal vein and surgeons who treated the president felt that the vein could not be successfully reconnected this left deep impression on carrel and he set about developing new techniques for suturing blood vessels the technique of triangulation using three stay sutures as traction points in order to minimize damage to the vascular wall during suturing was inspired by sewing lessons he took from an embroideress and is still used today julius comroe wrote between and alexis carrel using experimental animals performed every feat and developed every technique known to vascular surgery today he had great success in reconnecting arteries and veins and performing surgical grafts and this led to his nobel prize in wound antisepsis during world war carrel and the english chemist henry drysdale dakin developed the carrel dakin method of treating wounds based on chlorine dakin solution which preceding the development of antibiotics was major medical advance in the care of traumatic wounds for this carrel was awarded the légion honneur carrel also advocated the use of wound debridement cutting away necrotic or otherwise damaged tissue and irrigation of wounds his method of wound irrigation involved flushing the tissues with high volume of antiseptic fluid so that dirt and other contaminants would be washed away this is known today as mechanical irrigation organ transplants carrel co authored book with pilot charles lindbergh the culture of organs and worked with lindbergh in the mid to create the perfusion pump which allowed living organs to exist outside the body during surgery the advance is said to have been crucial step in the development of open heart surgery and organ transplants and to have laid the groundwork for the artificial heart which became reality decades later some critics of lindbergh claimed that carrel overstated lindbergh role to gain media attention but other sources say lindbergh played an important role in developing the device both lindbergh and carrel appeared on the cover of time magazine on june cellular senescence carrel was also interested in the phenomenon of senescence or aging he claimed that all cells continued to grow indefinitely and this became dominant view in the early th century carrel started an experiment on january where he placed tissue
