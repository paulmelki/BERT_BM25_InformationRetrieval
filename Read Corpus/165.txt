actinium is chemical element with the symbol ac and atomic number it was first isolated by french chemist andré louis debierne in friedrich oskar giesel later independently isolated it in and unaware that it was already known gave it the name emanium actinium gave the name to the actinide series group of similar elements between actinium and lawrencium in the periodic table it is also sometimes considered the first of the th period transition metals although lawrencium is less commonly given that position together with polonium radium and radon actinium was one of the first non primordial radioactive elements to be isolated soft silvery white radioactive metal actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming white coating of actinium oxide that prevents further oxidation as with most lanthanides and many actinides actinium assumes oxidation state in nearly all its chemical compounds actinium is found only in traces in uranium and thorium ores as the isotope ac which decays with half life of years predominantly emitting beta and sometimes alpha particles and ac which is beta active with half life of hours one tonne of natural uranium in ore contains about milligrams of actinium and one tonne of thorium contains about nanograms of actinium the close similarity of physical and chemical properties of actinium and lanthanum makes separation of actinium from the ore impractical instead the element is prepared in milligram amounts by the neutron irradiation of in nuclear reactor owing to its scarcity high price and radioactivity actinium has no significant industrial use its current applications include neutron source and an agent for radiation therapy history andré louis debierne french chemist announced the discovery of new element in he separated it from pitchblende residues left by marie and pierre curie after they had extracted radium in debierne described the substance as similar to titanium and in as similar to thorium friedrich oskar giesel independently discovered actinium in as substance being similar to lanthanum and called it emanium in after comparison of the substances half lives determined by debierne harriet brooks in and otto hahn and otto sackur in debierne chosen name for the new element was retained because it had seniority despite the contradicting chemical properties he claimed for the element at different times articles published in the and later suggest that debierne results published in conflict with those reported in and furthermore the now known chemistry of actinium precludes its presence as anything other than minor constituent of debierne and results in fact the chemical properties he reported make it likely that he had instead accidentally identified protactinium which would not be discovered for another fourteen years only to have it disappear due to its hydrolysis and adsorption onto his laboratory equipment this has led some authors to advocate that giesel alone should be credited with the discovery less confrontational vision of scientific discovery is proposed by adloff he suggests that hindsight criticism of the early publications should be mitigated by the then nascent state of radiochemistry highlighting the prudence of debierne claims in the original papers he notes that nobody can contend that debierne substance did not contain actinium debierne who is now considered by the vast majority of historians as the discoverer lost interest in the element and left the topic giesel on the other hand can rightfully be credited with the first preparation of radiochemically pure actinium and with the identification of its atomic number the name actinium originates from the ancient greek aktis aktinos ακτίς ακτίνος meaning beam or ray its symbol ac is also used in abbreviations of other compounds that have nothing to do with actinium such as acetyl acetate and sometimes acetaldehyde properties actinium is soft silvery white radioactive metallic element its estimated shear modulus is similar to that of lead owing to its strong radioactivity actinium glows in the dark with pale blue light which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation the first element of the actinides actinium gave the group its name much as lanthanum had done for the lanthanides the group of elements is more diverse than the lanthanides and therefore it was not until that the most significant change to dmitri mendeleev periodic table since the recognition of the lanthanides the introduction of the actinides was generally accepted after glenn seaborg research on the transuranium elements although it had been proposed as early as by british chemist henry bassett actinium reacts rapidly with oxygen and moisture in air forming white coating of actinium oxide that impedes further oxidation as with most lanthanides and actinides actinium exists in the oxidation state and the ac ions are colorless in solutions the oxidation state originates from the rn electronic configuration of actinium with three valence electrons that are easily donated to give the stable closed shell structure of the noble gas radon the rare oxidation state is only known for actinium dihydride ach even this may in reality be an electride compound like its lighter congener lah and thus have actinium iii ac is the largest of all known tripositive ions and its first coordination sphere contains approximately water molecules chemical compounds due to actinium intense radioactivity only limited number of actinium compounds are known these include acf accl acbr acof acocl acobr ac ac and acpo except for acpo they are all similar to the corresponding lanthanum compounds they all contain actinium in the oxidation state in particular the lattice constants of the analogous lanthanum and actinium compounds differ by only few percent formula color symmetry space group no pearson
