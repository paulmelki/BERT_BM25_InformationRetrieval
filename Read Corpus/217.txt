ball and stick model of an alcohol molecule rcoh the red and white balls represent the hydroxyl group oh the three stand for carbon substituents or hydrogen atoms the bond angle between hydroxyl group oh and chain of carbon atoms in chemistry alcohol is an organic compound that carries at least one hydroxyl functional group oh bound to saturated carbon atom the term alcohol originally referred to the primary alcohol ethanol ethyl alcohol which is used as drug and is the main alcohol present in alcoholic beverages an important class of alcohols of which methanol and ethanol are the simplest members includes all compounds for which the general formula is choh simple monoalcohols that are the subject of this article include primary rchoh secondary rchoh and tertiary rcoh alcohols the suffix ol appears in the iupac chemical name of all substances where the hydroxyl group is the functional group with the highest priority when higher priority group is present in the compound the prefix hydroxy is used in its iupac name the suffix ol in non iupac names such as paracetamol or cholesterol also typically indicates that the substance is an alcohol however many substances that contain hydroxyl functional groups particularly sugars such as glucose and sucrose have names which include neither the suffix ol nor the prefix hydroxy history alcohol distillation possibly originated in the indus valley civilization as early as bce the people of india used an alcoholic drink called sura made from fermented rice barley jaggery and flowers of the madhyaka tree alcohol distillation was known to islamic chemists as early as the eighth century the arab chemist al kindi unambiguously described the distillation of wine in treatise titled as the book of the chemistry of perfume and distillations the persian physician and polymath muhammad ibn zakariya al razi discovered alcohol as chemical compound nomenclature etymology the word alcohol is from the arabic kohl powder used as an eyeliner al is the arabic definite article equivalent to the in english alcohol was originally used for the very fine powder produced by the sublimation of the natural mineral stibnite to form antimony trisulfide it was considered to be the essence or spirit of this mineral it was used as an antiseptic eyeliner and cosmetic the meaning of alcohol was extended to distilled substances in general and then narrowed to ethanol when spirits was synonym for hard liquor bartholomew traheron in his translation of john of vigo introduces the word as term used by barbarous authors for fine powder vigo wrote the barbarous auctours use alcohol or as fynde it sometymes wryten alcofoll for moost fine poudre the lexicon chymicum by william johnson glosses the word as antimonium sive stibium by extension the word came to refer to any fluid obtained by distillation including alcohol of wine the distilled essence of wine libavius in alchymia refers to vini alcohol vel vinum alcalisatum johnson glosses alcohol vini as quando omnis superfluitas vini vino separatur ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum consumatur nihilque f√¶cum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat the word meaning became restricted to spirit of wine the chemical known today as ethanol in the th century and was extended to the class of substances so called as alcohols in modern chemistry after the term ethanol was invented in blending ethane with the ol ending of alcohol which was generalized as libfix systematic names iupac nomenclature is used in scientific publications and where precise identification of the substance is important especially in cases where the relative complexity of the molecule does not make such systematic name unwieldy in naming simple alcohols the name of the alkane chain loses the terminal and adds the suffix ol as in ethanol from the alkane chain name ethane when necessary the position of the hydroxyl group is indicated by number between the alkane name and the ol propan ol for propan ol for if higher priority group is present such as an aldehyde ketone or carboxylic acid then the prefix hydroxy is used as in hydroxy propanone some examples of simple alcohols and how to name them ch ch ch oh px px px px px px px px px propyl alcohol propan ol or propanol isopropyl alcohol propan ol or propanol cyclohexanol isobutyl alcohol methylpropan ol or methyl propanol tert amyl alcohol methylbutan ol or methyl butanol primary alcohol secondary alcohol secondary alcohol primary alcohol tertiary alcohol in cases where the oh functional group is bonded to an sp carbon on an aromatic ring the molecule is known as phenol and is named using the iupac rules for naming phenols common names in other less formal contexts an alcohol is often called with the name of the corresponding alkyl group followed by the word alcohol methyl alcohol ethyl alcohol propyl alcohol may be propyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol depending on whether the hydroxyl group is bonded to the end or middle carbon on the straight propane chain as described under systematic naming if another group on the molecule takes priority the alcohol moiety is often indicated using the hydroxy prefix alcohols are then classified into primary secondary sec and tertiary tert based upon the number of carbon atoms connected to the carbon atom that bears the hydroxyl functional group the respective numeric shorthands and are also sometimes used in informal settings the primary alcohols have general formulas rchoh the simplest primary alcohol is methanol choh for which and the next is ethanol for which ch the methyl group secondary alcohols are those of the form rr choh the simplest of which is propanol ch for the tertiary alcohols the general form is rr coh the simplest example is tert butanol methylpropan ol for which each of and is ch in these shorthands and represent substituents alkyl or other attached generally organic groups in archaic nomenclature alcohols can be named as derivatives of methanol using carbinol as the ending for instance ch coh can be named type formula iupac name common name choh methanol
