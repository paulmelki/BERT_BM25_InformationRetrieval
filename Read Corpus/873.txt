additive synthesis is sound synthesis technique that creates timbre by adding sine waves together the timbre of musical instruments can be considered in the light of fourier theory to consist of multiple harmonic or inharmonic partials or overtones each partial is sine wave of different frequency and amplitude that swells and decays over time due to modulation from an adsr envelope or low frequency oscillator additive synthesis most directly generates sound by adding the output of multiple sine wave generators alternative implementations may use pre computed wavetables or the inverse fast fourier transform explanation the sounds that are heard in everyday life are not characterized by single frequency instead they consist of sum of pure sine frequencies each one at different amplitude when humans hear these frequencies simultaneously we can recognize the sound this is true for both non musical sounds water splashing leaves rustling etc and for musical sounds piano note bird tweet etc this set of parameters frequencies their relative amplitudes and how the relative amplitudes change over time are encapsulated by the timbre of the sound fourier analysis is the technique that is used to determine these exact timbre parameters from an overall sound signal conversely the resulting set of frequencies and amplitudes is called the fourier series of the original sound signal in the case of musical note the lowest frequency of its timbre is designated as the sound fundamental frequency for simplicity we often say that the note is playing at that fundamental frequency middle is hz even though the sound of that note consists of many other frequencies as well the set of the remaining frequencies is called the overtones or the harmonics if their frequencies are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency of the sound in other words the fundamental frequency alone is responsible for the pitch of the note while the overtones define the timbre of the sound the overtones of piano playing middle will be quite different from the overtones of violin playing the same note that what allows us to differentiate the sounds of the two instruments there are even subtle differences in timbre between different versions of the same instrument for example an upright piano vs grand piano additive synthesis aims to exploit this property of sound in order to construct timbre from the ground up by adding together pure frequencies sine waves of varying frequencies and amplitudes we can precisely define the timbre of the sound that we want to create definitions schematic diagram of additive synthesis the inputs to the oscillators are frequencies and amplitudes harmonic additive synthesis is closely related to the concept of fourier series which is way of expressing periodic function as the sum of sinusoidal functions with frequencies equal to integer multiples of common fundamental frequency these sinusoids are called harmonics overtones or generally partials in general fourier series contains an infinite number of sinusoidal components with no upper limit to the frequency of the sinusoidal functions and includes dc component one with frequency of hz frequencies outside of the human audible range can be omitted in additive synthesis as result only finite number of sinusoidal terms with frequencies that lie within the audible range are modeled in additive synthesis waveform or function is said to be periodic if for all and for some period the fourier series of periodic function is mathematically expressed as where is the fundamental frequency of the waveform and is equal to the reciprocal of the period is the amplitude of the th harmonic is the phase offset of the th harmonic atan is the four quadrant arctangent function being inaudible the dc component and all components with frequencies higher than some finite limit are omitted in the following expressions of additive synthesis harmonic form the simplest harmonic additive synthesis can be mathematically expressed as where is the synthesis output and are the amplitude frequency and the phase offset respectively of the th harmonic partial of total of harmonic partials and is the fundamental frequency of the waveform and the frequency of the musical note time dependent amplitudes px example of harmonic additive synthesis in which each harmonic has time dependent amplitude the fundamental frequency is hz px problems listening to this file see media help more generally the amplitude of each harmonic can be prescribed as function of time in which case the synthesis output is each envelope should vary slowly relative to the frequency spacing between adjacent sinusoids the bandwidth of should be significantly less than inharmonic form additive synthesis can also produce inharmonic sounds which are aperiodic waveforms in which the individual overtones need not have frequencies that are integer multiples of some common fundamental frequency while many conventional musical instruments have harmonic partials an oboe some have inharmonic partials bells inharmonic additive synthesis can be described as where is the constant frequency of th partial px example of inharmonic additive synthesis in which both the amplitude and frequency of each partial are time dependent px problems listening to this file see media help time dependent frequencies in the general case the instantaneous frequency of sinusoid is the derivative with respect to time of the argument of the sine or cosine function if this frequency is represented in hertz rather than in angular frequency form then this derivative is divided by this is the case whether the partial is harmonic or inharmonic and whether its frequency is constant or time varying in the most general form the frequency of each non harmonic partial is non negative function of time yielding broader definitions additive synthesis more broadly may mean sound synthesis techniques that sum simple elements to create more complex timbres even when the elements are not sine waves for example richard moore listed additive synthesis as one of the four basic categories of sound synthesis alongside subtractive synthesis nonlinear synthesis and physical modeling in this broad sense pipe organs which also have pipes producing non sinusoidal waveforms can be considered as variant form of additive
