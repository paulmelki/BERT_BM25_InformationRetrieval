in linguistics an allomorph is variant phonetic form of morpheme or unit of meaning that varies in sound and spelling without changing the meaning the term allomorph describes the realization of phonological variations for specific morpheme the different allomorphs that morpheme can become are governed by morphophonemic rules these phonological rules determine what phonetic form or specific pronunciation morpheme will take based on the phonological or morphological context in which they appear allomorphs in english english has several morphemes that vary in sound but not in meaning such as past tense morphemes plural morphemes and negative morphemes past tense allomorphs for example in english past tense morpheme is ed it occurs in several allomorphs depending on its phonological environment assimilating voicing of the previous segment or inserting schwa after an alveolar stop as or in verbs whose stem ends with the alveolar stops or such as hunted or banded as in verbs whose stem ends with voiceless phonemes other than such as fished as in verbs whose stem ends with voiced phonemes other than such as buzzed the other than restrictions above commonly occur in allomorphy if the allomorphy conditions are ordered from most restrictive in this case after an alveolar stop to least restrictive then the first matching case usually win thus the above conditions could be rewritten as follows as or when the stem ends with the alveolar stops or as when the stem ends with voiceless phonemes as elsewhere the allomorph does not appear after stem final although the latter is voiceless is then explained by appearing in that environment together with the fact that the environments are ordered likewise the allomorph does not appear after stem final because the earlier clause for the allomorph takes priority the allomorph does not appear after stem final voiceless phoneme because the preceding clause for the takes priority irregular past tense forms such as broke or was were can be seen as still more specific cases since they are confined to certain lexical items such as the verb break which take priority over the general cases listed above plural allomorphs the plural morpheme for regular nouns in english is typically realized by adding an or es to the end of the noun however the plural morpheme actually has three different allomorphs and əz the specific pronunciation that plural morpheme takes on is determined by the following morphological rules assume that the basic form of the plural morpheme is ex bags bægz the morpheme becomes əz by inserting an before when noun ends in sibilant ex buses bʌsəz change the morpheme to voiceless when noun ends in voiceless sound ex caps kæps negative allomorphs in english the negative prefix in has three allomorphs in iŋ and im the phonetic form that the negative morpheme in takes on is determined by the following morphological rules the negative morpheme in becomes in when preceding an alveolar consonant ex intolerant in talərənt the morpheme in becomes iŋ when preceding velar consonant ex incongruous iŋ kɔŋruəs the morpheme in becomes im when preceding bilabial consonant ex improper im prapər suffix allomorphs in the sami languages the sami languages have trochaic pattern of alternating stressed and unstressed syllables the vowels and consonants allowed in an unstressed syllable differ from those allowed in stressed syllable consequently every suffix and inflectional ending has two forms and the form that is used depends on the stress pattern of the word it is attached to for example in northern sami there is the causative verb suffix hit ahttit where hit is selected when it would be the third syllable and the preceding verb has two syllables and ahttit is selected when it would be the third and fourth syllable and the preceding verb has three syllables goarru has two syllables so when suffixed the result is goaru hi nanosm it has three syllables so when suffixed the result is nanosm ahtti the same applies to inflectional patterns in the sami languages as well which are divided into even stems and odd stems stem allomorphy allomorphy can also exist in stems or roots as in classical sanskrit vāk voice singular plural nominative genitive instrumental locative there are three allomorphs of the stem and the allomorphs are conditioned by the particular case marking suffixes the form of the stem found in the nominative singular and locative plural is the etymological form of the morpheme pre indic palatalization of velars resulted in the variant form which was initially phonologically conditioned the conditioning can still be seen in the locative singular form for which the is followed by the high front vowel however subsequent merging of and into made the alternation unpredictable on phonetic grounds in the genitive case both singular and plural as well as the nominative plural and instrumental singular thus allomorphy was no longer directly relatable to phonological processes phonological conditioning also accounts for the form in the instrumental plural in which the assimilates in voicing to the following history the term was originally used to describe variations in chemical structure it was first applied to language in writing in by fatih şat and sibel merve in language xxiv see also null allomorph alternation linguistics allophone
