the ampere symbol often shortened to amp is the base unit of electric current in the international system of units si it is named after andré marie ampère french mathematician and physicist considered the father of the international system of units defines the ampere in terms of other base units by measuring the electromagnetic force between electrical conductors carrying electric current the earlier cgs system had two different definitions of current one essentially the same as the si and the other using electric charge as the base unit with the unit of charge defined by measuring the force between two charged metal plates the ampere was then defined as one coulomb of charge per second in si the unit of charge the coulomb is defined as the charge carried by one ampere during one second new definitions in terms of invariant constants of nature specifically the elementary charge took effect on may definition the ampere is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge to be when expressed in the unit which is equal to where the second is defined in terms of the unperturbed ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium atom the si unit of charge the coulomb is the quantity of electricity carried in second by current of ampere conversely current of one ampere is one coulomb of charge going past given point per second in general charge is determined by steady current flowing for time as constant instantaneous and average current are expressed in amperes as in the charging current is and the charge accumulated or passed through circuit over period of time is expressed in coulombs as in the battery charge is the relation of the ampere to the coulomb is the same as that of the watt to the joule history the ampere is named for french physicist and mathematician andré marie ampère who studied and laid the foundation of electrodynamics in recognition of ampère contributions to the creation of modern electrical science an international convention signed at the international exposition of electricity established the ampere as standard unit of electrical measurement for electric current the ampere was originally defined as one tenth of the unit of electric current in the centimetre gram second system of units that unit now known as the abampere was defined as the amount of current that generates force of two dynes per centimetre of length between two wires one centimetre apart the size of the unit was chosen so that the units derived from it in the mksa system would be conveniently sized the international ampere was an early realization of the ampere defined as the current that would deposit of silver per second from silver nitrate solution later more accurate measurements revealed that this current is since power is defined as the product of current and voltage the ampere can alternatively be expressed in terms of the other units using the relationship and thus current can be measured by multimeter device that can measure electrical voltage current and resistance former definition in the si until the si defined the ampere as follows the ampere is that constant current which if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length of negligible circular cross section and placed one metre apart in vacuum would produce between these conductors force equal to newtons per metre of length ampère force law states that there is an attractive or repulsive force between two parallel wires carrying an electric current this force is used in the formal definition of the ampere the si unit of charge the coulomb was then defined as the quantity of electricity carried in second by current of ampere conversely current of one ampere is one coulomb of charge going past given point per second in general charge was determined by steady current flowing for time as realisation the standard ampere is most accurately realised using kibble balance but is in practice maintained via ohm law from the units of electromotive force and resistance the volt and the ohm since the latter two can be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce the josephson effect and the quantum hall effect respectively techniques to establish the realisation of an ampere have relative uncertainty of approximately few parts in and involve realisations of the watt the ohm and the volt see also ammeter ampacity current carrying capacity electric current electric shock hydraulic analogy magnetic constant orders of magnitude current references external links the nist reference on constants units and uncertainty nist definition of ampere and
