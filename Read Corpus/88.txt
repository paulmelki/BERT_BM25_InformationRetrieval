an android is robot or other artificial being designed to resemble human and often made from flesh like material historically androids were completely within the domain of science fiction and frequently seen in film and television but recent advances in robot technology now allow the design of functional and realistic humanoid robots etymology early example of the term androides used to describe human like mechanical devices london times december the word was coined from the greek root ἀνδρ andr man male as opposed to ἀνθρωπ anthrōp human being and the suffix oid having the form or likeness of in greek however ανδροειδής is an adjective while the term android is used in reference to human looking robots in general robot with female appearance can also be referred to as gynoid or fembot the oxford english dictionary traces the earliest use as androides to ephraim chambers cyclopaedia in reference to an automaton that st albertus magnus allegedly created by the late androides elaborate mechanical devices resembling humans performing human activities were displayed in exhibit halls the term android appears in us patents as early as in reference to miniature human like toy automatons the term android was used in more modern sense by the french author auguste villiers de isle adam in his work tomorrow eve this story features an artificial humanlike robot named hadaly as said by the officer in the story in this age of realien advancement who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls the term made an impact into english pulp science fiction starting from jack williamson the cometeers and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by edmond hamilton captain future although karel čapek robots in rossum universal robots the play that introduced the word robot to the world were organic artificial humans the word robot has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans animals and other beings the term android can mean either one of these while cyborg cybernetic organism or bionic man would be creature that is combination of organic and mechanical parts the term droid popularized by george lucas in the original star wars film and now used widely within science fiction originated as an abridgment of android but has been used by lucas and others to mean any robot including distinctly non human form machines like the word android was used in star trek the original series episode what are little girls made of the abbreviation andy coined as pejorative by writer philip dick in his novel do androids dream of electric sheep has seen some further usage such as within the tv series total recall authors have used the term android in more diverse ways than robot or cyborg in some fictional works the difference between robot and android is only superficial with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot like internal mechanics in other stories authors have used the word android to mean wholly organic yet artificial creation other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between eric wilson who defines an android as synthetic human being distinguishes between three types of android based on their body composition the mummy type made of dead things or stiff inanimate natural material such as mummies puppets dolls and statues the golem type made from flexible possibly organic material including golems and homunculi the automaton type made from mix of dead and living parts including automatons and robots although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts simulacra devices that exhibit likeness and automata devices that have independence projects several projects aiming to create androids that look and to certain degree speak or act like human being have been launched or are underway japan der japanese actroid japanese robotics have been leading the field since the waseda university initiated the wabot project in and in completed the wabot the first android full scale humanoid intelligent robot its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs and to grip and transport objects with hands using tactile sensors its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors artificial eyes and ears and its conversation system allowed it to communicate with person in japanese with an artificial mouth in wabot was revealed and made number of improvements it was capable of playing the organ wabot had ten fingers and two feet and was able to read score of music it was also able to accompany person in honda began its humanoid research and development program to create humanoid robots capable of interacting successfully with humans the intelligent robotics lab directed by hiroshi ishiguro at osaka university and the kokoro company demonstrated the actroid at expo in aichi prefecture japan and released the telenoid in in kokoro developed new der android the height of the human body part of der is cm there are mobile points der can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body the air servosystem which kokoro developed originally is used for the actuator as result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via servosystem the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise der realized slimmer body than that of the former version by using smaller cylinder outwardly der has more beautiful proportion compared to the previous model der has thinner arms and wider repertoire of expressions once programmed it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice the intelligent mechatronics lab directed by hiroshi kobayashi at the tokyo university of science has developed an android head called saya which was exhibited at robodex in yokohama japan there are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time which will hopefully introduce broader spectrum of
