aeschylus aiskhylos bc was an ancient greek tragedian he is often described as the father of tragedy academics knowledge of the genre begins with his work and understanding of earlier tragedies is largely based on inferences made from reading his surviving plays according to aristotle he expanded the number of characters in the theatre and allowed conflict among them before this characters interacted only with the chorus only seven of his estimated seventy to ninety plays have survived there is long standing debate regarding the authorship of one of these plays prometheus bound some believe that his son euphorion wrote it fragments from other of aeschylus plays have survived in quotations and more continue to be discovered on egyptian papyrus these fragments often give further insights into aeschylus work he was probably the first dramatist to present plays as trilogy his oresteia is the only extant and ancient example at least one of his plays was influenced by the persians second invasion of greece bc this work the persians is one of very few classical greek tragedies concerned with contemporary events and the only one extant the significance of the war against persia was so great to aeschylus and the greeks that aeschylus epitaph commemorates his participation in the greek victory at marathon while making no mention of his success as playwright despite this aeschylus work particularly the oresteia is generally acclaimed by modern critics and scholars life bust of aeschylus at north carolina museum of art aeschylus was born in bc in eleusis small town about kilometers northwest of athens in the fertile valleys of western attica some scholars argue that his date of birth may be based on counting back forty years from his first victory in the great dionysia his family was wealthy and well established his father euphorion was member of the eupatridae the ancient nobility of attica but this might be fiction invented by the ancients to account for the grandeur of aeschylus plays as youth aeschylus worked at vineyard until according to the nd century ad geographer pausanias the god dionysus visited him in his sleep and commanded him to turn his attention to the nascent art of tragedy as soon as he woke he began to write tragedy and his first performance took place in bc when he was years old he won his first victory at the city dionysia in bc in bc when aeschylus was years old cleomenes expelled the sons of peisistratus from athens and cleisthenes came to power cleisthenes reforms included system of registration that emphasized the importance of the deme over family tradition in the last decade of the th century aeschylus and his family were living in the deme of eleusis the persian wars played large role in aeschylus life and career in bc he and his brother cynegeirus fought to defend athens against the invading army of darius of persia at the battle of marathon the athenians emerged triumphant and the victory was celebrated across the city states of greece cynegeirus was killed while trying to prevent persian ship retreating from the shore for which his countrymen extolled him as hero in bc aeschylus was called into military service again together with his younger brother ameinias against xerxes invading forces at the battle of salamis aeschylus also fought at the battle of plataea in bc ion of chios was witness for aeschylus war record and his contribution in salamis salamis holds prominent place in the persians his oldest surviving play which was performed in bc and won first prize at the dionysia aeschylus was one of many greeks who were initiated into the eleusinian mysteries an ancient cult of demeter based in his home town of eleusis initiates gained secret knowledge through these rites likely concerning the afterlife firm details of specific rites are sparse as members were sworn under the penalty of death not to reveal anything about the mysteries to non initiates nevertheless according to aristotle aeschylus was accused of asebeia for revealing some of the cult secrets on stage other sources claim that an angry mob tried to kill aeschylus on the spot but he fled the scene heracleides of pontus asserts that the audience tried to stone aeschylus aeschylus took refuge at the altar in the orchestra of the theater of dionysus he pleaded ignorance at his trial he was acquitted with the jury sympathetic to the military service of him and his brothers during the persian wars according to the nd century ad author aelian aeschylus younger brother ameinias helped to acquit aeschylus by showing the jury the stump of the hand he had lost at salamis where he was voted bravest warrior the truth is that the award for bravery at salamis went not to aeschylus brother but to ameinias of pallene aeschylus travelled to sicily once or twice in the bc having been invited by hiero of syracuse major greek city on the eastern side of the island he produced the women of aetna during one of these trips in honor of the city founded by hieron and restaged his persians by bc after the death of phrynichus one of his chief rivals aeschylus was the yearly favorite in the dionysia winning first prize in nearly every competition in bc aeschylus staged the production that included the persians with pericles serving as choregos death the death of aeschylus illustrated in the th century florentine picture chronicle by maso finiguerra in bc he returned to sicily for the last time visiting the city of gela where he died in or bc valerius maximus wrote that he was killed outside the city by tortoise dropped by an eagle possibly lammergeier or cinereous vulture which do open tortoises for eating by dropping them on hard objects which had mistaken his head for rock suitable for shattering the shell pliny in his naturalis histori√¶ adds that aeschylus had been staying outdoors to avoid prophecy that he would be killed by falling object but
