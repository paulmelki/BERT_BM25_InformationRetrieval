th century portrait based on an ancient engraved gem anacharsis was scythian philosopher he travelled from his homeland on the northern shores of the black sea to athens in the early th century bc and made great impression as forthright and outspoken barbarian that is non greek speaker he very well could have been forerunner of the cynics in part because of his strong but playful parrhesia none of his works have survived life anacharsis the son of gnurus scythian chief was half greek and from mixed hellenic culture apparently in the region of the cimmerian bosporus he left his native country to travel in pursuit of knowledge and came to athens about bc at time when solon was occupied with his legislative measures according to the story recounted by hermippus anacharsis arrived at the house of solon and said have traveled here from afar to make you my friend solon replied it better to make friends at home thereupon the scythian replied then it is necessary for you being at home to make friends with me solon laughed and accepted him as his friend anacharsis cultivated the outsider knack of seeing the illogic in familiar things for example plutarch remarks that he expressed his wonder at the fact that in greece wise men spoke and fools decided his conversation was droll and frank and solon and the athenians took to him as sage and philosopher his rough and free discourse became proverbial among athenians as scythian discourse anacharsis was the first foreigner metic who received the privileges of athenian citizenship he was reckoned by some ancient authors as one of the seven sages of greece and it is said that he was initiated into the eleusinian mysteries of the great goddess privilege denied to those who did not speak fluent greek according to herodotus when anacharsis returned to the scythians he was killed by his own brother for his greek ways and especially for the impious attempt to sacrifice to the mother goddess cybele whose cult was unwelcome among the scythians ideas anacharsis depicted as medieval scholar in the nuremberg chronicle none of the works ascribed to him in ancient times if indeed they were written by him have survived he was said to have written book comparing the laws of the scythians with the laws of the greeks as well as work on the art of war all that remains of his thought is what later tradition ascribes to him he became famous for the simplicity of his way of living and his acute observations on the institutions and customs of the greeks he exhorted moderation in everything saying that the vine bears three clusters of grapes the first pleasure the second drunkenness the third disgust so he became kind of emblem to the athenians who inscribed on his statues restrain your tongues your appetites your passions there are ten extant letters ascribed to him one of which is also quoted by cicero greetings from anacharsis to hanno my clothing is scythian cloak my shoes are the hard soles of my feet my bed is the earth my food is only seasoned by hunger and eat nothing but milk and cheese and meat come and visit me and you will find me at peace you want to give me something but give it to your fellow citizens instead or let the immortal gods have it all of the letters are spurious the first nine probably date from the rd century bc they are usually included among the cynic epistles and reflect how the cynic philosophers viewed him as prefiguring many of their ideas the tenth letter is quoted by diogenes laërtius it is addressed to croesus the proverbially rich king of lydia it too is fictitious anacharsis to croesus king of the lydians am come to the country of the greeks in order to become acquainted with their customs and institutions but have no need of gold and shall be quite contented if return to scythia better man than left it however will come to sardis as think it very desirable to become friend of yours strabo makes him the probably legendary inventor of the anchor with two flukes and others made him the inventor of the potter wheel having been informed that solon was employed to draw up code of laws for the athenians anacharsis described his occupation saying laws are spider webs which catch the little flies but cannot hold the big ones solon showed anacharsis some laws that he was drafting for the athenians anacharsis laughed at solon for imagining that the dishonesty and greed of the athenians could be restrained by written laws such laws said anacharsis are like spiderwebs they catch the weak and poor but the rich can rip right through them revival in the th century sacrifice cup attributed to anacharsis in jean jacques barthelemy highly esteemed classical scholar and jesuit published the travels of anacharsis the younger in greece about young scythian descended from anacharsis the volume work was an imaginary travel journal one of the first historical novels which klemperer called the encyclopedia of the new cult of the antique in the late th century it affected the growth of philhellenism in france at the time the book went through many editions was reprinted in the united states and translated into german and other languages it later inspired european sympathy for the greek struggle for independence and spawned sequels and imitations through the th century quotes vine bears three grapes the first of pleasure the second of drunkenness and the third of repentance diogenes laërtius of anacharsis he also said that he marvelled that among the greeks those who were skilful in thing contend together but those who have no such skill act as judges of the contest diogenes laërtius of anacharsis notes classical references herodotus iv lucian scytha cicero tusc disp diogenes laërtius athenaeus iv xiv aelian varia historia
