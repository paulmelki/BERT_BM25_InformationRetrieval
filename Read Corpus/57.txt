apollo was the spaceflight that first landed humans on the moon more generally this event in was the first time anyone from earth set foot on another astronomical object commander neil armstrong and lunar module pilot buzz aldrin formed the american crew that landed the apollo lunar module eagle on july at utc cst armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and minutes later on july at utc aldrin joined him minutes later they spent about two and quarter hours together outside the spacecraft and they collected of lunar material to bring back to earth command module pilot michael collins flew the command module columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the moon surface armstrong and aldrin spent hours minutes on the lunar surface at site they named tranquility base before lifting off to rejoin columbia in lunar orbit apollo was launched by saturn rocket from kennedy space center on merritt island florida on july at utc and it was the fifth crewed mission of nasa apollo program the apollo spacecraft had three parts command module cm with cabin for the three astronauts the only part that returned to earth service module sm which supported the command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and water and lunar module lm that had two stages descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit after being sent to the moon by the saturn third stage the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit armstrong and aldrin then moved into eagle and landed in the sea of tranquility on july the astronauts used eagle ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin collins in the command module they jettisoned eagle before they performed the maneuvers that propelled columbia out of the last of its lunar orbits onto trajectory back to earth they returned to earth and splashed down in the pacific ocean on july after more than eight days in space armstrong first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live television to an unprecedented worldwide audience of about million people fifth of the world population he described the event as it happened that one small step for man one giant leap for mankind apollo effectively ended the space race and fulfilled national goal proposed in by president john kennedy before this decade is out of landing man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth background in the late and early the united states was engaged in the cold war geopolitical rivalry with the soviet union on october the soviet union launched sputnik the first artificial satellite this surprise success fired fears and imaginations around the world it demonstrated that the soviet union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over distances and challenged american claims of military economic and technological superiority this precipitated the sputnik crisis and triggered the space race president dwight eisenhower responded to the sputnik challenge by creating the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and initiating project mercury which aimed to launch man into earth orbit but on april soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person in space and the first to orbit the earth nearly month later on may alan shepard became the first american in space completing minute suborbital journey after being recovered from the atlantic ocean he received congratulatory telephone call from eisenhower successor john kennedy since the soviet union had higher lift capacity launch vehicles kennedy chose from among options presented by nasa challenge beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry so that the us and soviet union would be starting from position of equality crewed mission to the moon would serve this purpose on may kennedy addressed the united states congress on urgent national needs and declared on september kennedy delivered another speech before crowd of about people in the rice university football stadium in houston texas widely quoted refrain from the middle portion of the speech reads as follows president john kennedy speaking at rice university on september in spite of that the proposed program faced the opposition of many americans and was dubbed moondoggle by norbert wiener mathematician at the massachusetts institute of technology the effort to land man on the moon already had name project apollo when kennedy met with nikita khrushchev the premier of the soviet union in june he proposed making the moon landing joint project but khrushchev did not take up the offer kennedy again proposed joint expedition to the moon in speech to the united nations general assembly on september the idea of joint moon mission was abandoned after kennedy death an early and crucial decision was choosing lunar orbit rendezvous over both direct ascent and earth orbit rendezvous space rendezvous is an orbital maneuver in which two spacecraft navigate through space and meet up in july nasa head james webb announced that lunar orbit rendezvous would be used and that the apollo spacecraft would have three major parts command module cm with cabin for the three astronauts and the only part that returned to earth service module sm which supported the command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and water and lunar module lm that had two stages descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit this design meant the spacecraft could be launched by single saturn rocket that was then under development technologies and techniques required for apollo were developed by project gemini the apollo project was enabled by nasa adoption of new advances in semiconductor electronic technology including metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors mosfets in the interplanetary monitoring platform imp and silicon integrated circuit ic chips in the apollo guidance computer agc project apollo was abruptly halted by the apollo fire on january in which astronauts gus grissom ed white and roger chaffee died
