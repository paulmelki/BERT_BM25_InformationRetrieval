ammonia is compound of nitrogen and hydrogen with the formula nh stable binary hydride and the simplest pnictogen hydride ammonia is colourless gas with characteristic pungent smell it is common nitrogenous waste particularly among aquatic organisms and it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as precursor to food and fertilizers ammonia either directly or indirectly is also building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceutical products and is used in many commercial cleaning products it is mainly collected by downward displacement of both air and water although common in nature both terrestrially and in the outer planets of the solar system and in wide use ammonia is both caustic and hazardous in its concentrated form it is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the united states and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce store or use it in significant quantities the global industrial production of ammonia in was million tonnes with no significant change relative to the global industrial production of million tonnes industrial ammonia is sold either as ammonia liquor usually ammonia in water or as pressurized or refrigerated anhydrous liquid ammonia transported in tank cars or cylinders nh boils at at pressure of one atmosphere so the liquid must be stored under pressure or at low temperature household ammonia or ammonium hydroxide is solution of nh in water the concentration of such solutions is measured in units of the baumé scale density with degrees baumé about by weight ammonia at being the typical high concentration commercial product etymology pliny in book xxxi of his natural history refers to salt produced in the roman province of cyrenaica named hammoniacum so called because of its proximity to the nearby temple of jupiter amun greek ἄμμων ammon however the description pliny gives of the salt does not conform to the properties of ammonium chloride according to herbert hoover commentary in his english translation of georgius agricola de re metallica it is likely to have been common sea salt in any case that salt ultimately gave ammonia and ammonium compounds their name natural occurrence ammonia is chemical found in trace quantities in nature being produced from nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter ammonia and ammonium salts are also found in small quantities in rainwater whereas ammonium chloride sal ammoniac and ammonium sulfate are found in volcanic districts crystals of ammonium bicarbonate have been found in patagonia guano the kidneys secrete ammonia to neutralize excess acid ammonium salts are found distributed through fertile soil and in seawater ammonia is also found throughout the solar system on mars jupiter saturn uranus neptune and pluto among other places on smaller icy bodies such as pluto ammonia can act as geologically important antifreeze as mixture of water and ammonia can have melting point as low as if the ammonia concentration is high enough and thus allow such bodies to retain internal oceans and active geology at far lower temperature than would be possible with water alone substances containing ammonia or those that are similar to it are called ammoniacal properties ammonia is colourless gas with pungent smell it is lighter than air its density being times that of air it is easily liquefied due to the strong hydrogen bonding between molecules the liquid boils at and freezes to white crystals at ammonia may be conveniently deodorized by reacting it with either sodium bicarbonate or acetic acid both of these reactions form an odourless ammonium salt solid the crystal symmetry is cubic pearson symbol cp space group no lattice constant nm liquid liquid ammonia possesses strong ionising powers reflecting its high of liquid ammonia has very high standard enthalpy change of vaporization kj mol cf water kj mol methane kj mol phosphine kj mol and can therefore be used in laboratories in uninsulated vessels without additional refrigeration see liquid ammonia as solvent solvent properties ammonia readily dissolves in water in an aqueous solution it can be expelled by boiling the aqueous solution of ammonia is basic the maximum concentration of ammonia in water saturated solution has density of cm and is often known as ammonia combustion ammonia does not burn readily or sustain combustion except under narrow fuel to air mixtures of air when mixed with oxygen it burns with pale yellowish green flame ignition occurs when chlorine is passed into ammonia forming nitrogen and hydrogen chloride if chlorine is present in excess then the highly explosive nitrogen trichloride ncl is also formed decomposition at high temperature and in the presence of suitable catalyst ammonia is decomposed into its constituent elements decomposition of ammonia is slightly endothermic process requiring kcal mol of ammonia and yields hydrogen and nitrogen gas ammonia can also be used as source of hydrogen for acid fuel cells if the unreacted ammonia can be removed ruthenium and platinum catalysts were found to be the most active whereas supported ni catalysts were the less active structure the ammonia molecule has trigonal pyramidal shape as predicted by the valence shell electron pair repulsion theory vsepr theory with an experimentally determined bond angle of the central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom this gives total of eight electrons or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs which leaves one lone pair of electrons the lone pair repels more strongly than bond pairs therefore the bond angle is not as expected for regular tetrahedral arrangement but this shape gives the molecule dipole moment and makes it polar the molecule polarity and especially its ability to form hydrogen bonds makes ammonia highly miscible with water the lone pair makes ammonia base proton acceptor ammonia is moderately basic aqueous solution has ph of and if strong acid is added to such solution until the solution is neutral ph of the ammonia molecules are protonated temperature and salinity also affect the proportion of nh the latter has the shape of regular tetrahedron and
