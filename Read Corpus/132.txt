the extent of the aegean sea on map of the mediterranean sea the aegean sea is an elongated embayment of the mediterranean sea located between the balkanian and anatolian peninsulas the sea has an area of some square kilometres in the north the aegean is connected to the marmara sea and the black sea by the straits of the dardanelles and the bosphorus the aegean islands are located within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery including crete and rhodes the sea reaches maximum depth of meters to the east of crete the thracian sea and the myrtoan sea are subdivisions of the aegean sea the aegean islands can be divided into several island groups including the dodecanese the cyclades the sporades the saronic islands and the north aegean islands as well as crete and its surrounding islands the dodecanese located to the southeast includes the islands of rhodes kos and patmos the islands of delos and naxos are within the cyclades to the south of the sea lesbos is part of the north aegean islands euboea the second largest island in greece is located in the aegean despite being administered as part of central greece nine out of twelve of the administrative regions of greece border the sea along with the turkish provinces of edirne canakkale balıkesir izmir aydın and muğla to the east of the sea various turkish islands in the sea are imbros tenedos cunda island and the foça islands the aegean sea has been historically important especially in regards to the civilization of ancient greece who inhabited the area around the coast of the aegean and the aegean islands the aegean islands facilitated contact between the people of the area and between europe and asia along with the greeks thracians lived among the northern coast the romans conquered the area under the roman empire and later the byzantine empire held it against advances by the first bulgarian empire the fourth crusade weakened byzantine control of the area and it was eventually conquered by the ottoman empire with the exception of crete which was venetian colony until the greek war of independence allowed greek state on the coast of the aegean from onwards the ottoman empire held presence over the sea for over years until it was replaced by modern turkey the rocks making up the floor of the aegean are mainly limestone though often greatly altered by volcanic activity that has convulsed the region in relatively recent geologic times of particular interest are the richly coloured sediments in the region of the islands of santorini and milos in the south aegean notable cities on the aegean coastline include athens thessaloniki volos kavala and heraklion in greece and zmir and bodrum in turkey the aegean sea groundwater itself has high salinity content leading one to think that the soil would be infertile due to the volcanic region but actually has an equilibrium with its soil content structure making it able to grow fertile crops on land that would seem infertile number of issues concerning sovereignty within the aegean sea are disputed between greece and turkey the aegean dispute has had large effect on greek turkish relations since the issues include the delimitation of territorial waters national airspace exclusive economic zones and flight information regions name and etymology late latin authors referred the name aegaeus to aegeus whom they said to have jumped into that sea instead of jumping from the athenian acropolis as told by some greek authors he was the father of theseus the mythical king and founder hero of athens aegeus had told theseus to put up white sails when returning if he was successful in killing the minotaur when theseus returned he forgot these instructions and aegeus thinking his son to have died then drowned himself in the sea the sea was known in latin as aegaeum mare under the control of the roman empire the venetians who ruled many greek islands in the high and late middle ages popularized the name archipelago greek αρχιπέλαγος meaning main sea or chief sea name that held on in many european countries until the early modern period in the south slavic languages the aegean is called white sea bulgarian macedonian serbo croatian the turkish name for the sea is ege denizi derived from the greek name geography the aegean sea is an elongated embayment of the mediterranean sea and covers about in area measuring about longitudinally and latitudinal the sea maximum depth is located at point east of crete the aegean islands are found within its waters with the following islands delimiting the sea on the south generally from west to east kythera antikythera crete kasos karpathos and rhodes the anatolian peninsula marks the eastern boundary of the sea while the greek mainland marks the west several seas are contained within the aegean sea the thracian sea is section of the aegean located to the north the icarian sea to the east the myrtoan sea to the west while the sea of crete is the southern section the greek regions that border the sea in alphabetical order are attica central greece central macedonia crete eastern macedonia and thrace north aegean peloponnese south aegean and thessaly the historical region of macedonia also borders the sea to the north the aegean islands which almost all belong to greece can be divided into seven groups northeastern aegean islands which lie in the thracian sea east aegean islands euboea northern sporades cyclades saronic islands or argo saronic islands dodecanese or southern sporades crete many of the aegean islands or island chains are geographically extensions of the mountains on the mainland one chain extends across the sea to chios another extends across euboea to samos and third extends across the peloponnese and crete to rhodes dividing the aegean from the mediterranean the bays and gulfs of the aegean beginning at the south and moving clockwise include on crete the mirabello almyros souda and chania bays or gulfs on the
