agate is common rock formation consisting of chalcedony and quartz as its primary components consisting of wide variety of colors agates are primarily formed within volcanic and metamorphic rocks the ornamental use of agate dates back to ancient greece in assorted jewelry and in the seal stones of greek warriors etymology and history the stone was given its name by theophrastus greek philosopher and naturalist who discovered the stone along the shore line of the dirillo river or achates in sicily sometime between the th and rd centuries bc ancient use agate is one of the most common materials used in the art of hardstone carving and has been recovered at number of ancient sites indicating its widespread use in the ancient world for example archaeological recovery at the knossos site on crete illustrates its role in bronze age minoan culture formation and characteristics botswana agate agate minerals have the tendency to form on or within pre existing rocks creating difficulties in accurately determining their time of formation their host rocks have been dated to have formed as early as the archean eon agates are most commonly found as nodules within the cavities of volcanic rocks these cavities are formed from the gases trapped within the liquid volcanic material forming vesicles cavities are then filled in with silica rich fluids from the volcanic material layers are deposited on the walls of the cavity slowly working their way inwards the first layer deposited on the cavity walls is commonly known as the priming layer variations in the character of the solution or in the conditions of deposition may cause corresponding variation in the successive layers these variations in layers result in bands of chalcedony often alternating with layers of crystalline quartz forming banded agate hollow agates can also form due to the deposition of liquid rich silica not penetrating deep enough to fill the cavity completely agate will form crystals within the reduced cavity the apex of each crystal may point towards the center of the cavity the priming layer is often dark green but can be modified by iron oxide resulting in rust like appearance agate is very durable and therefore is often seen detached from its eroding matrix once removed the outer surface is usually pitted and rough from filling the cavity of its former matrix agates have also been found in sedimentary rocks normally in limestone or dolomite these sedimentary rocks require cavities often from decomposed branches or other buried organic material if silica rich fluids are able to penetrate into these cavities agates can be formed hollow agate types lace agate is variety that exhibits lace like pattern with forms such as eyes swirls bands or zigzags blue lace agate is found in africa and is especially hard crazy lace agate typically found in mexico is often brightly colored with complex pattern demonstrating randomized distribution of contour lines and circular droplets scattered throughout the rock the stone is typically coloured red and white but is also seen to exhibit yellow and grey combinations as well moss agate as the name suggests exhibits moss like pattern and is of greenish colour the coloration is not created by any vegetative growth but rather through the mixture of chalcedony and oxidized iron hornblende dendritic agate also displays vegetative features including fern like patterns formed due to the presence of manganese and iron oxides turritella agate elimia tenera is formed from the shells of fossilized freshwater turritellas gastropods with elongated spiral shells similarly coral petrified wood porous rocks and other organic remains can also form agate coldwater agates such as the lake michigan cloud agate did not form under volcanic processes but instead formed within the limestone and dolomite strata of marine origin like volcanic origin agates coldwater agates formed from silica gels that lined pockets and seams within the bedrock these agates are typically less colorful with banded lines of grey and white chalcedony greek agate is name given to pale white to tan colored agate found in sicily once greek colony back to bc the greeks used it for making jewelry and beads brazilian agate is found as sizable geodes of layered nodules these occur in brownish tones inter layered with white and gray quartz forms within these nodules creating striking specimen when cut opposite the layered growth axis it is often dyed in various colors for ornamental purposes polyhedroid agate forms in flat sided shape similar to polyhedron when sliced it often shows characteristic layering of concentric polygons it has been suggested that growth is not controlled but is due to the filling in of spaces between pre existing crystals which have since dissolved other forms of agate include holley blue agate also spelled holly blue agate rare dark blue ribbon agate only found near holley oregon lake superior agate carnelian agate has reddish hues botswana agate plume agate condor agate tube agate containing visible flow channels or pinhole sized tubes fortification agate with contrasting concentric banding reminiscent of defensive ditches and walls around ancient forts binghamite variety found only on the cuyuna iron range near crosby in crow wing county minnesota fire agate showing an iridescent internal flash or fire the result of layer of clear agate over layer of hydrothermally deposited hematite patuxent river stone red and yellow form of agate only found in maryland enhydro agate contains tiny inclusions of water sometimes with air bubbles fossil agatized coral florida jpg alt piece of translucent pink agatized coral with ruffled appearance along the top edge agatized coral dendritic agate jpg

agate elimia tenera crazy lace agate macro panorama jpg crazy lace agate uses in industry and art industrial uses of agate exploit its hardness ability to retain highly polished surface finish and resistance to chemical attack it has traditionally been used to make knife edge
