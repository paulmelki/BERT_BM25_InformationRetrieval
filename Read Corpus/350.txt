aromatic compounds are those chemical compounds most commonly organic that contain one or more rings with pi electrons delocalized all the way around them in contrast to compounds that exhibit aromaticity aliphatic compounds lack this delocalization the term aromatic was assigned before the physical mechanism determining aromaticity was discovered and referred simply to the fact that many such compounds have sweet or pleasant odour however not all aromatic compounds have sweet odour and not all compounds with sweet odour are aromatic aromatic hydrocarbons or arenes are aromatic organic compounds containing solely carbon and hydrogen atoms the configuration of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is called benzene ring after the simple aromatic compound benzene or phenyl group when part of larger compound not all aromatic compounds are benzene based aromaticity can also manifest in heteroarenes which follow hückel rule for monocyclic rings when the number of its electrons equals where in these compounds at least one carbon atom is replaced by one of the heteroatoms oxygen nitrogen or sulfur examples of non benzene compounds with aromatic properties are furan heterocyclic compound with five membered ring that includes single oxygen atom and pyridine heterocyclic compound with six membered ring containing one nitrogen atom benzene ring model benzene benzene is the least complex aromatic hydrocarbon and it was the first one named as such the nature of its bonding was first recognized by august kekulé in the th century each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share one goes to the hydrogen atom and one to each of the two neighbouring carbons this leaves one electron to share with one of the two neighbouring carbon atoms thus creating double bond with one carbon and leaving single bond with the other which is why some representations of the benzene molecule portray it as hexagon with alternating single and double bonds other depictions of the structure portray the hexagon with circle inside it to indicate that the six electrons are floating around in delocalized molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself this represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon carbon bonds all of bond order the equivalency is explained by resonance forms the electrons are visualized as floating above and below the ring with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat general properties of aromatic hydrocarbons they display aromaticity the carbon hydrogen ratio is high they burn with strong sooty yellow flame because of the high carbon hydrogen ratio they undergo electrophilic substitution reactions and nucleophilic aromatic substitutions the circle symbol for aromaticity was introduced by sir robert robinson and his student james armit in and popularized starting in by the morrison boyd textbook on organic chemistry the proper use of the symbol is debated some publications use it to any cyclic system while others use it only for those systems that obey hückel rule jensen argues that in line with robinson original proposal the use of the circle symbol should be limited to monocyclic electron systems in this way the circle symbol for six center six electron bond can be compared to the symbol for three center two electron bond arene synthesis reaction that forms an arene compound from an unsaturated or partially unsaturated cyclic precursor is simply called aromatization many laboratory methods exist for the organic synthesis of arenes from non arene precursors many methods rely on cycloaddition reactions alkyne trimerization describes the cyclization of three alkynes in the dötz reaction an alkyne carbon monoxide and chromium carbene complex are the reactants diels alder reactions of alkynes with pyrone or with expulsion of carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide also form arene compounds in bergman cyclization the reactants are an enyne plus hydrogen donor another set of methods is the aromatization of cyclohexanes and other aliphatic rings reagents are catalysts used in hydrogenation such as platinum palladium and nickel reverse hydrogenation quinones and the elements sulfur and selenium reactions aromatic ring systems participate in many organic reactions aromatic substitution in aromatic substitution one substituent on the arene ring usually hydrogen is replaced by another substituent the two main types are electrophilic aromatic substitution when the active reagent is an electrophile and nucleophilic aromatic substitution when the reagent is nucleophile in radical nucleophilic aromatic substitution the active reagent is radical an example of electrophilic aromatic substitution is the nitration of salicylic acid nitration of salicylic acid coupling reactions in coupling reactions metal catalyses coupling between two formal radical fragments common coupling reactions with arenes result in the formation of new carbon carbon bonds alkylarenes vinyl arenes biraryls new carbon nitrogen bonds anilines or new carbon oxygen bonds aryloxy compounds an example is the direct arylation of coupling reaction hydrogenation hydrogenation of arenes create saturated rings the compound naphthol is completely reduced to mixture of decalin ol isomers naphthol hydrogenation the compound resorcinol hydrogenated with raney nickel in presence of aqueous sodium hydroxide forms an enolate which is alkylated with methyl iodide to methyl cyclohexandione resorcinol hydrogenation cycloadditions cycloaddition reaction are not common unusual thermal diels alder reactivity of arenes can be found in the wagner jauregg reaction other photochemical cycloaddition reactions with alkenes occur through excimers dearomatization in dearomatization reactions the aromaticity of the reactant is permanently lost benzene and derivatives of benzene benzene derivatives have from one to six substituents attached to the central benzene core examples of benzene compounds with just one substituent are phenol which carries hydroxyl group and toluene with methyl group when there is more than one substituent present on the ring their spatial relationship becomes important for which the arene substitution patterns ortho meta and para are devised for example three isomers exist for cresol because the methyl group and the hydroxyl group can be placed next to each other ortho one position removed from each other meta or two positions removed from each other para xylenol has two methyl groups in addition to the hydroxyl group and for this structure isomers exist file toluene svg toluene file
