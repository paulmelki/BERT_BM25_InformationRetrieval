and an adjunct professor of computer science at the university of california los angeles he is also on the advisory board of tti vanguard until mid he was senior fellow at hp labs visiting professor at kyoto university and an adjunct professor at the massachusetts institute of technology mit kay is also former professional jazz guitarist composer and theatrical designer and an amateur classical

molecular biology in before and during this time he worked as professional jazz guitarist during his studies at cu he wrote the music for an adaptation of the hobbit and other campus theatricals in the autumn of he began graduate school at the university of utah college of engineering he earned master of science in electrical engineering in before taking his doctor of philosophy ph in computer science in his doctoral dissertation flex flexible extendable language described the invention of computer language known as flex while there he worked with fathers of computer graphics david evans who had been recently recruited from the university of california berkeley to start utah computer science department and ivan sutherland best known for writing such pioneering programs as sketchpad their mentorship greatly inspired kay evolving views on objects and programming as he grew busier with research for the defense advanced research projects agency darpa he ended his musical career in he met seymour papert and learned of the programming language logo dialect of lisp optimized for educational purposes this led him to learn of the work of jean piaget jerome bruner lev vygotsky and of constructionist learning further influencing his professional orientation leaving utah as an associate professor of computer science in kay became visiting researcher at the stanford artificial intelligence laboratory in anticipation of accepting professorship at carnegie mellon university instead in he joined the xerox parc research staff in palo alto california throughout the decade he developed prototypes of networked workstations using the programming language smalltalk these inventions were later commercialized by apple in their lisa and macintosh computers kay is one of the fathers of the idea of object oriented programming which he named along with some colleagues at parc some of the original object oriented concepts including the use of the words object and class had been developed for simula at the norwegian computing center later he said sorry that long ago coined the term objects for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea the big idea is messaging while at parc kay conceived the dynabook concept key progenitor of laptop and tablet computers and the book he is also the architect of the modern overlapping windowing graphical user interface gui because the dynabook was conceived as an educational platform kay is considered to be one of the first researchers into mobile learning many features of the dynabook concept have been adopted in the design of the one laptop per child educational platform with which kay is actively involved the field of computing is awaiting new revolution to happen according to kay in which educational communities parents and children will not see in it set of tools invented by douglas engelbart but medium in the marshall mcluhan sense he wrote as with simulas leading to oop this encounter finally hit me with what the destiny of personal computing really was going to be not personal dynamic vehicle as in engelbart metaphor opposed to the ibm railroads but something much more profound personal dynamic medium with vehicle one could wait until high school and give drivers ed but if it was medium it had to extend into the world of childhood recent work and recognition from to kay was atari chief scientist in he became an apple fellow following the closure of the apple advanced technology group in he was recruited by his friend bran ferren head of research and development at disney to join walt disney imagineering as disney fellow he remained there until ferren left to start applied minds inc with imagineer danny hillis leading to the cessation of the fellows program in he founded viewpoints research institute non profit organization dedicated to children learning and advanced software development for its first ten years kay and his viewpoints group were based at applied minds in glendale california where he and ferren continued to work together on various projects kay was also senior fellow at hewlett packard until hp disbanded the advanced software research team on july kay taught fall class powerful ideas useful tools to understand the
