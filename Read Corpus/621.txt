apollo was the seventh crewed mission in the apollo space program and the third meant to land on the moon the craft was launched from kennedy space center on april but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the service module sm failed two days into the mission the crew instead looped around the moon and returned safely to earth on april the mission was commanded by jim lovell with jack swigert as command module cm pilot and fred haise as apollo lunar module lm pilot swigert was late replacement for ken mattingly who was grounded after exposure to rubella routine stir of an oxygen tank ignited damaged wire insulation inside it causing an explosion that vented the contents of both of the sm oxygen tanks to space without oxygen needed for breathing and for generating electric power the sm propulsion and life support systems could not operate the cm systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry forcing the crew to transfer to the lm as lifeboat with the lunar landing canceled mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive although the lm was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days mission control in houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days the crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power chilly and wet cabin and shortage of potable water there was critical need to adapt the cm cartridges for the carbon dioxide scrubber system to work in the lm the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising solution the astronauts peril briefly renewed public interest in the apollo program tens of millions watched the splashdown in the south pacific ocean on television an investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that teflon was placed inside it the board recommended changes including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank this was done for apollo the story of apollo has been dramatized several times most notably in the film apollo based on the memoir co authored by lovell lost moon and an episode of the miniseries from the earth to the moon background in president john kennedy challenged his nation to land an astronaut on the moon by the end of the decade with safe return to earth nasa worked towards this goal incrementally sending astronauts into space during project mercury and project gemini leading up to the apollo program the goal was achieved with apollo which landed on the moon on july neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the lunar surface while michael collins orbited the moon in command module columbia the mission returned to earth on july fulfilling kennedy challenge nasa had contracted for fifteen saturn rockets to achieve the goal at the time no one knew how many missions this would require since success was obtained in with the sixth saturnv on apollo nine rockets remained available for hoped for total of ten landings after the excitement of apollo the general public grew apathetic towards the space program and congress continued to cut nasa budget apollo was canceled despite the successful lunar landing the missions were considered so risky that astronauts could not afford life insurance to provide for their families if they died in space mission operations control room during the tv broadcast just before the apollo accident astronaut fred haise is shown on the screen even before the first astronaut entered space in planning for centralized facility to communicate with the spacecraft and monitor its performance had begun for the most part the brainchild of christopher kraft jr who became nasa first flight director during john glenn mercury friendship flight in february the first crewed orbital flight by the one of kraft decisions was overruled by nasa managers he was vindicated by post mission analysis and implemented rule that during the mission the flight director word was absolute to overrule him nasa would have to fire him on the spot flight directors during apollo had one sentence job description the flight director may take any actions necessary for crew safety and mission success in houston mission control center opened in part designed by kraft and now named for him in mission control each flight controller in addition to monitoring telemetry from the spacecraft was in communication via voice loop to specialists in staff support room or back room who focused on specific spacecraft systems apollo was to be the second mission meant to demonstrate precision lunar landings and explore specific sites on the moon with kennedy goal accomplished by apollo and apollo demonstrating that the astronauts could perform precision landing mission planners were able to focus on more than just landing safely and having astronauts minimally trained in geology gather lunar samples to take home to earth there was greater role for science on apollo especially for geology something emphasized by the mission motto ex luna scientia from the moon knowledge astronauts and key mission control personnel apollo mission commander jim lovell was years old at the time of the spaceflight which was his fourth and last he was graduate of the united states naval academy and had been naval aviator and test pilot before being selected for the second group of astronauts in he flew with frank borman in gemini in and buzz aldrin in gemini the following year before flying in apollo in the first spacecraft to orbit the moon at the time of apollo lovell was the nasa astronaut with the most time in space with hours over the three missions jack swigert the command module pilot cmp was years old and held in mechanical engineering and an in aerospace science he had served in the air force and in state air national guards and was an engineering test pilot before being selected for the fifth group of astronauts in fred haise the lunar module pilot lmp was years old
