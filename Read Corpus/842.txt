in greek mythology aeolus aiolos modern greek quick moving nimble is name shared by three mythical characters these three personages are often difficult to tell apart and even the ancient mythographers appear to have been perplexed about which aeolus was which diodorus siculus made an attempt to define each of these three although it is clear that he also became muddled and his opinion is followed here the first aeolus was son of hellen and eponymous founder of the aeolian race the second aeolus was son of poseidon who led colony to islands in the tyrrhenian sea the third aeolus was son of hippotes who is mentioned in odyssey and the aeneid as the keeper of the winds all three men named aeolus appear to be connected genealogically although the precise relationship especially regarding the second and third aeolus is often ambiguous as their identities seem to have been merged by many ancient writers aeolus was also the name of the following minor characters aeolus was defender of thebes in the war of the seven against thebes he was killed by parthenopaeus aeolus was trojan companion of aeneas in italy where he was killed by turnus king of the rutulians aeolus was father of clytius and misenus otherwise unknown to fame he survived both the greeks and achilles at troy and richard thomas pointed out textual parallels between this passage and the illiad book notes references gaius julius hyginus fabulae from the myths of hyginus translated and edited by mary grant university of kansas publications in humanistic studies online version at the topos text project homer the odyssey with an english translation by murray ph in two volumes cambridge ma harvard university press london william heinemann ltd online version at the perseus digital library greek text available from the same website pseudo apollodorus the library with an english translation by sir james george frazer in volumes cambridge ma harvard university press london william heinemann ltd online version at the perseus digital library greek text available from the same website publius papinius statius the thebaid translated by john henry mozley loeb classical library volumes cambridge ma harvard university press london william heinemann ltd online version at the topos text project publius papinius statius the thebaid vol ii john henry mozley london william heinemann new york putnam sons latin text available at the perseus digital library publius vergilius maro aeneid theodore williams trans boston houghton mifflin co online version at the perseus digital library publius vergilius maro bucolics aeneid and georgics greenough boston ginn co latin text available at the perseus digital library
