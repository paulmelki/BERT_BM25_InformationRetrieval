st dominic of silos enthroned as abbot hispano flemish gothic th century abbot from the aramaic abba meaning father is an ecclesiastical title given to the male head of monastery in various western religious traditions including christianity the office may also be given as an honorary title to clergyman who is not the head of monastery the female equivalent is abbess origins the title had its origin in the monasteries of egypt and syria spread through the eastern mediterranean and soon became accepted generally in all languages as the designation of the head of monastery the word is derived from the aramaic meaning father or meaning my father it still has this meaning in contemporary israeli hebrew אבא in the septuagint it was written as abbas at first it was employed as respectful title for any monk but it was soon restricted by canon law to certain priestly superiors at times it was applied to various priests at the court of the frankish monarchy the of the palace and of the camp were chaplains to the merovingian and carolingian sovereigns court and army respectively the title of abbot came into fairly general use in western monastic orders whose members include priests monastic history coptic icon of saint pachomius the founder of cenobitic monasticism carving of saint benedict of nursia holding an abbot crozier and his rule for monasteries germany

monks called also in the east hegumen or archimandrite the english version for female monastic head is abbess early history in egypt the first home of monasticism the jurisdiction of the abbot or archimandrite was but loosely defined sometimes he ruled over only one community sometimes over several each of which had its own abbot as well saint john cassian speaks of an abbot of the thebaid who had monks under him by the rule of st benedict which until the cluniac reforms was the norm in the west the abbot has jurisdiction over only one community the rule as was inevitable was subject to frequent violations but it was not until the foundation of the cluniac order that the idea of supreme abbot exercising jurisdiction over all the houses of an order was definitely recognised monks as rule were laymen nor at the outset was the abbot any exception for the reception of the sacraments and for other religious offices the abbot and his monks were commanded to attend the nearest church this rule proved inconvenient when monastery was situated in desert or at distance from city and necessity compelled the ordination of some monks this innovation was not introduced without struggle ecclesiastical dignity being regarded as inconsistent with the higher spiritual life but before the close of the th century at least in the east abbots seem almost universally to have become deacons if not priests the change spread more slowly in the west where the office of abbot was commonly filled by laymen till the end of the th century the ecclesiastical leadership exercised by abbots despite their frequent lay status is proved by their attendance and votes at ecclesiastical councils thus at the first council of constantinople ad archimandrites or abbots sign with bishops the second council of nicaea ad recognized the right of abbots to ordain their monks to the inferior orders below the diaconate power usually reserved to bishops abbots used to be subject to episcopal jurisdiction and continued generally so in fact in the west till the th century the code of justinian lib tit iii de ep leg xl expressly subordinates the abbot to episcopal oversight the first case recorded of the partial exemption of an abbot from episcopal control is that of faustus abbot of lerins at the council of arles ad but the exorbitant claims and exactions of bishops to which this repugnance to episcopal control is to be traced far more than to the arrogance of abbots rendered it increasingly frequent and in the th century the practice of exempting religious houses partly or altogether from episcopal control and making them responsible to the pope alone received an impulse from pope gregory the great these exceptions introduced with good object had grown into widespread evil by the th century virtually creating an imperium in imperio and depriving the bishop of all authority over the chief centres of influence in his diocese later middle ages in the th century the abbots of fulda claimed precedence of the archbishop of cologne abbots more and more assumed almost episcopal state and in defiance of the prohibition of early councils and the protests of st bernard and others adopted the episcopal insignia of mitre ring gloves and sandals it has been maintained that the right to wear mitres was sometimes granted by the popes to abbots before the th century but the documents on which this claim is based are not genuine braun liturgische gewandung the first undoubted instance is the bull by which alexander ii in granted the use of the mitre to egelsinus abbot
