the atanasoff berry computer abc was the first automatic electronic digital computer limited by the technology of the day and execution the device has remained somewhat obscure the abc priority is debated among historians of computer technology because it was neither programmable nor turing complete the first real programmable and turing complete machines the and the colossus computer from used similar valve based technology as abc overview conceived in the machine was built by iowa state college mathematics and physics professor john vincent atanasoff with the help of graduate student clifford berry it was designed only to solve systems of linear equations and was successfully tested in however its intermediate result storage mechanism paper card writer reader was not perfected and when john vincent atanasoff left iowa state college for world war ii assignments work on the machine was discontinued the abc pioneered important elements of modern computing including binary arithmetic and electronic switching elements but its special purpose nature and lack of changeable stored program distinguish it from modern computers the computer was designated an ieee milestone in atanasoff and berry computer work was not widely known until it was rediscovered in the amidst patent disputes over the first instance of an electronic computer at that time eniac that had been created by john mauchly and presper eckert was considered to be the first computer in the modern sense but in district court invalidated the eniac patent and concluded that the eniac inventors had derived the subject matter of the electronic digital computer from atanasoff when in the mid the secrecy surrounding the british world war ii development of the colossus computers that pre dated eniac was lifted and colossus was described at conference in los alamos new mexico in june john mauchly and konrad zuse were reported to have been astonished design and construction diagram of the abc pointing out its various components according to atanasoff account several key principles of the atanasoff berry computer were conceived in sudden insight after long nighttime drive to rock island illinois during the winter of the abc innovations included electronic computation binary arithmetic parallel processing regenerative capacitor memory and separation of memory and computing functions the mechanical and logic design was worked out by atanasoff over the next year grant application to build proof of concept prototype was submitted in march to the agronomy department which was also interested in speeding up computation for economic and research analysis of further funding to complete the machine came from the nonprofit research corporation of new york city the abc was built by atanasoff and berry in the basement of the physics building at iowa state college during the initial funds were released in september and the tube prototype was first demonstrated in october december demonstration prompted grant for construction of the full scale machine the abc was built and tested over the next two years january story in the des moines register announced the abc as an electrical computing machine with more than vacuum tubes that would compute complicated algebraic equations but gave no precise technical description of the computer the system weighed more than it contained approximately of wire dual triode vacuum tubes thyratrons and was about the size of desk it was not turing complete computer which distinguishes it from more general machines of the same era such as konrad zuse and the colossus computers of nor did it implement the stored program architecture first implemented in the manchester baby of required for fully general purpose practical computing machines add subtract module reconstructed from atanasoff berry computer the machine was however the first to implement three critical ideas that are still part of every modern computer using binary digits to represent all numbers and data performing all calculations using electronics rather than wheels ratchets or mechanical switches organizing system in which computation and memory are separated the memory of the atanasoff berry computer was system called regenerative capacitor memory which consisted of pair of drums each containing capacitors that rotated on common shaft once per second the capacitors on each drum were organized into bands of active bands and two spares in case capacitor failed giving the machine speed of additions subtractions per second data was represented as bit binary fixed point numbers the electronics of the memory and arithmetic units could store and operate on such numbers at time bits the alternating current power line frequency of hz was the primary clock rate for the lowest level operations the arithmetic logic functions were fully electronic implemented with vacuum tubes the family of logic gates ranged from inverters to two and three input gates the input and output levels and operating voltages were compatible between the different gates each gate consisted of one inverting vacuum tube amplifier preceded by resistor divider input network that defined the logical function the control logic functions which only needed to operate once per drum rotation and therefore did not require electronic speed were implemented with relays the alu operated on only one bit of each number at time it kept the carry borrow bit in capacitor for use in the next ac cycle although the atanasoff berry computer was an important step up from earlier calculating machines it was not able to run entirely automatically through an entire problem an operator was needed to operate the control switches to set up its functions much like the electro mechanical calculators and unit record equipment of the time selection of the operation to be performed reading writing converting to or from binary to decimal or reducing set of equations was made by front panel switches and in some cases jumpers there were two forms of input and output primary user input and output and an intermediate results output and input the intermediate results storage allowed operation on problems too large to be handled entirely within the electronic memory the largest problem that could be solved without the use of the intermediate output and input was two simultaneous
