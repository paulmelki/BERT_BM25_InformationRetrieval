agnosticism is the view that the existence of god of the divine or the supernatural is unknown or unknowable another definition provided is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that god exists or the belief that god does not exist the english biologist thomas henry huxley coined the word agnostic in and said it simply means that man shall not say he knows or believes that which he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe earlier thinkers however had written works that promoted agnostic points of view such as sanjaya belatthaputta th century bce indian philosopher who expressed agnosticism about any afterlife and protagoras th century bce greek philosopher who expressed agnosticism about the existence of the gods defining agnosticism being scientist above all else huxley presented agnosticism as form of demarcation hypothesis with no supporting objective testable evidence is not an objective scientific claim as such there would be no way to test said hypotheses leaving the results inconclusive his agnosticism was not compatible with forming belief as to the truth or falsehood of the claim at hand karl popper would also describe himself as an agnostic according to philosopher william rowe in this strict sense agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that god exists or the belief that god does not exist george smith while admitting that the narrow definition of atheist was the common usage definition of that word and admitting that the broad definition of agnostic was the common usage definition of that word promoted broadening the definition of atheist and narrowing the definition of agnostic smith rejects agnosticism as third alternative to theism and atheism and promotes terms such as agnostic atheism the view of those who do not hold belief in the existence of any deity but claim that the existence of deity is unknown or inherently unknowable and agnostic theism the view of those who believe in the existence of deity but claim that the existence of deity is unknown or inherently unknowable etymology agnostic was used by thomas henry huxley in speech at meeting of the metaphysical society in to describe his philosophy which rejects all claims of spiritual or mystical knowledge early christian church leaders used the greek word gnosis knowledge to describe spiritual knowledge agnosticism is not to be confused with religious views opposing the ancient religious movement of gnosticism in particular huxley used the term in broader more abstract sense huxley identified agnosticism not as creed but rather as method of skeptical evidence based inquiry in recent years scientific literature dealing with neuroscience and psychology has used the word to mean not knowable in technical and marketing literature agnostic can also mean independence from some parameters for example platform agnostic referring to cross platform software or hardware agnostic qualifying agnosticism scottish enlightenment philosopher david hume contended that meaningful statements about the universe are always qualified by some degree of doubt he asserted that the fallibility of human beings means that they cannot obtain absolute certainty except in trivial cases where statement is true by definition tautologies such as all bachelors are unmarried or all triangles have three corners types strong agnosticism also called hard closed strict or permanent agnosticism the view that the question of the existence or nonexistence of deity or deities and the nature of ultimate reality is unknowable by reason of our natural inability to verify any experience with anything but another subjective experience strong agnostic would say cannot know whether deity exists or not and neither can you weak agnosticism also called soft open empirical or temporal agnosticism the view that the existence or nonexistence of any deities is currently unknown but is not necessarily unknowable therefore one will withhold judgment until evidence if any becomes available weak agnostic would say don know whether any deities exist or not but maybe one day if there is evidence we can find something out apathetic agnosticism the view that no amount of debate can prove or disprove the existence of one or more deities and if one or more deities exist they do not appear to be concerned about the fate of humans therefore their existence has little to no impact on personal human affairs and should be of little interest an apathetic agnostic would say don know whether any deity exist or not and don care if any deity exists or not history hindu philosophy throughout the history of hinduism there has been strong tradition of philosophic speculation and skepticism the rig veda takes an agnostic view on the fundamental question of how the universe and the gods were created nasadiya sukta creation hymn in the tenth chapter of the rig veda says hume kant and kierkegaard aristotle anselm aquinas descartes and gödel presented arguments attempting to rationally prove the existence of god the skeptical empiricism of david hume the antinomies of immanuel kant and the existential philosophy of søren kierkegaard convinced many later philosophers to abandon these attempts regarding it impossible to construct any unassailable proof for the existence or non existence of god in his book philosophical fragments kierkegaard writes hume was huxley favourite philosopher calling him the prince of agnostics diderot wrote to his mistress telling of visit by hume to the baron holbach and describing how word for the position that huxley would later describe as agnosticism didn seem to exist or at least wasn common knowledge at the time united kingdom charles darwin charles darwin raised in religious environment charles darwin studied to be an anglican clergyman while eventually doubting parts of his faith darwin continued to help in church affairs even while avoiding church attendance darwin stated that it would be absurd to doubt that man
