charles de gaulle french navy helicopter carrier and escort vessels an aircraft carrier is warship that serves as seagoing airbase equipped with full length flight deck and facilities for carrying arming deploying and recovering aircraft typically it is the capital ship of fleet as it allows naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear powered warships that carry numerous fighters strike aircraft helicopters and other types of aircraft while heavier aircraft such as fixed wing gunships and bombers have been launched from aircraft carriers it is currently not possible to land them by its diplomatic and tactical power its mobility its autonomy and the variety of its means the aircraft carrier is often the centerpiece of modern combat fleets tactically or even strategically it replaced the battleship in the role of flagship of fleet one of its great advantages is that by sailing in international waters it does not interfere with any territorial sovereignty and thus obviates the need for overflight authorizations from third party countries reduces the times and transit distances of aircraft and therefore significantly increase the time of availability on the combat zone chart comparing range of aircraft carriers from longest top left to shortest there is no single definition of an aircraft carrier and modern navies use several variants of the type these variants are sometimes categorized as sub types of aircraft carriers and sometimes as distinct types of naval aviation capable ships aircraft carriers may be classified according to the type of aircraft they carry and their operational assignments admiral sir mark stanhope rn former first sea lord head of the royal navy has said to put it simply countries that aspire to strategic international influence have aircraft carriers henry kissinger while united states secretary of state also said an aircraft carrier is tons of diplomacy as of there are active aircraft carriers in the world operated by fourteen navies the united states navy has large nuclear powered fleet carriers carrying around fighter jets each the largest carriers in the world the total combined deck space is over twice that of all other nations combined as well as the aircraft carrier fleet the navy has nine amphibious assault ships used primarily for helicopters although these also carry up to vertical or short take off and landing stol fighter jets and are similar in size to medium sized fleet carriers the united kingdom and china each operate two aircraft carriers france india and russia each operate single medium size carrier with capacity of to fighter jets italy operates two light fleet carriers and spain operates one helicopter carriers are operated by japan france australia egypt south korea thailand and brazil future aircraft carriers are under construction or in planning by brazil china france india russia and the us types of carriers french aircraft carrier rear and navy carrier conducting joint operations in the persian gulf both with the catobar configuration general features speed is an important asset for aircraft carriers as they need to be deployed anywhere in the world quickly and must be fast enough to evade detection and targeting by enemy forces to avoid nuclear submarines they should be faster than knots aircraft carriers are among the largest warships as much deck room is needed an aircraft carrier must be able to perform increasingly diverse mission sets diplomacy power projection quick crisis response force land attack from the sea sea base for helicopter and amphibious assault forces anti surface warfare asuw defensive counter air dca and humanitarian aid disaster relief hadr are some of the missions the aircraft carrier is expected to accomplish traditionally an aircraft carrier is supposed to be one ship that can perform at least power projection and sea control missions an aircraft carrier must be able to efficiently operate an air combat group this means it should handle fixed wing jets as well as helicopters this includes ships designed to support operations of short takeoff vertical landing stovl jets basic types amphibious assault ship anti submarine warfare carrier balloon carrier and balloon tenders escort carrier fleet carrier flight deck cruiser helicopter carrier light aircraft carrier sea control ship seaplane tender and seaplane carriers aircraft cruiser note some of the types listed here are not strictly defined as aircraft carriers by some sources by role of the indian navy has the stobar configuration fleet carrier is intended to operate with the main fleet and usually provides an offensive capability these are the largest carriers capable of fast speeds by comparison escort carriers were developed to provide defense for convoys of ships they were smaller and slower with lower numbers of aircraft carried most were built from mercantile hulls or in the case of merchant aircraft carriers were bulk cargo ships with flight deck added on top light aircraft carriers were fast enough to operate with the main fleet but of smaller size with reduced aircraft capacity the soviet aircraft carrier admiral kusnetsov was termed heavy aircraft carrying cruiser this was primarily legal construct to avoid the limitations of the montreux convention preventing aircraft carriers transiting the turkish straits between the soviet black sea bases and the mediterranean these ships while sized in the range of large fleet carriers were designed to deploy alone or with escorts in addition to supporting fighter aircraft and helicopters they provide both strong defensive weaponry and heavy offensive missiles equivalent to guided missile cruiser by configuration aircraft carriers today are usually divided into the following four categories based on the way that aircraft take off and land catapult assisted take off barrier arrested recovery catobar these carriers generally carry the largest heaviest and most heavily armed aircraft although smaller catobar carriers may have other limitations weight capacity of aircraft elevator etc all catobar carriers in service today are nuclear powered two nations currently operate carriers of this type
