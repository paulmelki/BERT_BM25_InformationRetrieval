africa and parts of the sahel afroasiatic languages have over million native speakers the fourth largest number of any language family after indo european sino tibetan and niger congo the phylum has six branches berber chadic cushitic egyptian omotic and semitic by far the most widely spoken afroasiatic language or dialect continuum is arabic de facto group of distinct language varieties within the semitic branch the languages that evolved from proto arabic have around million native speakers concentrated primarily in west asia and north africa in addition to languages spoken today afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages such as ancient egyptian which forms distinct branch of the family and akkadian biblical hebrew and old aramaic all of which are from the semitic branch the original homeland of the afroasiatic family and when the parent language proto afroasiatic was spoken are yet to be agreed upon by historical linguists proposed locations include the horn of africa north africa the eastern sahara and the levant etymology in the early th century linguists grouped the berber cushitic and egyptian languages within hamitic phylum in acknowledgement of these languages genetic relation with each other and with those in the semitic phylum the terms hamitic and semitic were etymologically derived from the book of genesis which describes various biblical tribes descended from ham and shem two sons of noah by the the main constituent elements within the broader afroasiatic family had been worked out friedrich müller introduced the name hamito semitic for the entire language family in his grundriss der maurice delafosse later coined the term afroasiatic often now spelled afro asiatic however it did not come into general use until joseph greenberg formally proposed its adoption in doing so greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that hamitic was not valid group and that language cladistics did not reflect race individual scholars have also called the family erythraean tucker and lisramic hodge in lieu of hamito semitic the russian linguist igor diakonoff later suggested the term afrasian meaning half african half asiatic in reference to the geographic distribution of the family constituent languages the term hamito semitic remains in use in the academic traditions of some european countries as well as in the official census of the government of india distribution and branches interrelations between branches of afroasiatic lipiński some linguists proposals for grouping within afroasiatic scholars generally treat the afroasiatic language family as including the following five branches whereas omotic is disputed berber chadic cushitic egyptian omotic semitic although there is general agreement on these six families linguists who study afroasiatic raise some points of disagreement in particular the omotic language branch is the most controversial member of afroasiatic because the grammatical formatives to which most linguists have given the greatest weight in classifying languages in the family are either absent or distinctly wobbly hayward greenberg and others considered it subgroup of cushitic whereas others have raised doubts about its being part of afroasiatic at all theil the afroasiatic identity of ongota is also broadly questioned as is its position within afroasiatic among those who accept it due to the mixed appearance of the language and paucity of research and data harold fleming proposes that ongota constitutes separate branch of afroasiatic bonny sands finds the proposal by savà and tosco the most convincing namely that ongota is an east cushitic language with nilo saharan substratum in other words it would appear that the ongota people once spoke nilo saharan language but then shifted to speaking cushitic language but retained some characteristics of their earlier nilo saharan language beja sometimes listed as separate branch of afroasiatic is more often included in the cushitic branch which has substantial degree of internal diversity there is no consensus on the of the five non omotic branches of afroasiatic see subgrouping below this situation is not unusual even among long established language families scholars also frequently disagree on the internal classification of the indo european languages for instance the extinct meroitic language has been proposed bruce trigger as an unclassified afroasiatic language because it shares the phonotactics characteristic of the family but there is not enough evidence to secure classification fritz hintze the classification of kujargé within afroasiatic is not agreed upon blench notes that much of the basic vocabulary looks cushitic and speculates that kujarge could even be conservative language transitional between chadic and cushitic demographics in descending order of number of speakers widely spoken afroasiatic languages include arabic semitic the most widely
