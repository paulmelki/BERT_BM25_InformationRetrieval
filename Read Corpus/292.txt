the amber diceless roleplaying game is role playing game created and written by erick wujcik set in the fictional universe created by author roger zelazny for his chronicles of amber the game is unusual in that no dice are used in resolving conflicts or player actions instead simple diceless system of comparative ability and narrative description of the action by the players and gamemaster is used to determine how situations are resolved amber drpg was created in the and is much more focused on relationships and roleplaying than most of the roleplaying games of that era most amber characters are members of the two ruling classes in the amber multiverse and are much more advanced in matters of strength endurance psyche warfare and sorcery than ordinary beings this often means that the only individuals who are capable of opposing character are from his or her family fact that leads to much suspicion and intrigue history erick wujcik offered to design an amber role playing game for west end games who agreed to look at his work wujcik intended to integrate the feel of the amber setting from the novels into role playing game and playtested his system for few months at the michigan gaming center where he decided to try it out as diceless game west end was not interested in diceless role playing game so wujcik acquired the rpg rights to amber and took the game to talsorian games until he withdrew over creative differences wujcik then founded phage press and published amber diceless role playing in the original page game book was published in by phage press covering material from the first five novels the corwin cycle and some details sorcery and the logrus from the remaining five novels the merlin cycle in order to allow players to roleplay characters from the courts of chaos some details were changed slightly to allow more player choice for example players can be full trump artists without having walked the pattern or the logrus which merlin says is impossible and players psychic abilities are far greater than those shown in the books cover of shadow knight page companion volume shadow knight was published in this supplemental rule book includes the remaining elements from the merlin novels such as broken patterns and allows players to create constructs such as merlin ghostwheel the book presents the second series of novels not as additions to the series continuity but as an example of roleplaying campaign with merlin luke julia jurt and coral as the pcs the remainder of the book is collection of essays on the game statistics for the new characters and an update of the older ones in light of their appearance in the second series and perhaps most usefully for gms plot summaries of each of the ten books the book includes some material from the short story the salesman tale and some unpublished material cut from prince of chaos notably coral pregnancy by merlin both books were translated into french and published by jeux descartes in and third book rebma was promised cover art was commissioned and pre orders were taken but it was never published wujcik also expressed desire to create book giving greater detail to the courts of chaos the publishing rights to the amber drpg games were acquired in by guardians of order who took over sales of the game and announced their intention to release new edition of the game however no new edition was released before guardians of order went out of business in the two existing books are now out of print but they have been made available as pdf downloads in june new publishing company headed by edwin voskamp and eric todd was formed with the express purpose of bringing amber drpg back into print the new company is named diceless by design in may rite publishing secured license from diceless by design to use the rules system with new setting in the creation of new product to be written by industry and system veteran jason durall the project lords of gossamer shadow diceless was funded via kickstarter in may in sept the project was completed and on in nov lords of gossamer and shadow diceless was released publicly in full color print and pdf along with additional supplements and continued support setting the game is set in the multiverse described in zelazny chronicles of amber the first book assumes that gamemasters will set their campaigns after the patternfall war that is after the end of the fifth book in the series the courts of chaos but uses material from the following books to describe those parts of zelazny cosmology that were featured there in more detail the amber multiverse consists of amber city at one pole of the universe wherein is found the pattern the symbol of order the courts of chaos an assembly of worlds at the other pole where can be found the logrus the manifestation of chaos and the abyss the source or end of all reality and shadow the collection of all possible universes shadows between and around them inhabitants of either pole can use one or both of the pattern and the logrus to travel through shadow it is assumed that players will portray the children of the main characters from the books the ruling family of amber known as the elder amberites or resident of the courts however since some feel that being the children of the main characters is too limiting it is fairly common to either start with king oberon death before the book begins and roleplay the elder amberites as they vie for the throne or to populate amber from scratch with different set of elder amberites the former option is one presented in the book the latter is known in the amber community as an amethyst game third option is to have the players portray corwin children in an amber like city built around corwin pattern this is sometimes called an argent
