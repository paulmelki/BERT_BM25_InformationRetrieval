adolph wilhelm hermann kolbe september november was contributor in the birth of modern organic chemistry he was professor at marburg and leipzig kolbe coined the term synthesis and contributed to the philosophical demise of vitalism through synthesis of the organic substance acetic acid from carbon disulfide and also contributed to the development of structural theory this was done via modifications to the idea of radicals and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his kolbe electrolysis of carboxylate salts the kolbe schmitt reaction in the preparation of aspirin and the kolbe nitrile synthesis after studies with wöhler and bunsen kolbe was involved with the early of chemistry through overseas work in london with frankland and rose through the ranks of his field to edit the journal für praktische chemie as such he was elected to the royal swedish academy of sciences won the royal society of london davy medal in the year of his death despite these accomplishments and his training storied next generation of chemists including zaitsev curtius beckmann graebe markovnikov etc kolbe is remembered for editing the journal for more than decade where his rejection of kekulé structure of benzene van hoff theory on the origin of chirality and von baeyer reforms of nomenclature were personally critical and linguistically violent kolbe died of heart attack in leipzig at age six years after the death of his wife charlotte he was survived by four children life kolbe was born in elliehausen near göttingen kingdom of hanover germany as the eldest son of protestant pastor at the age of he entered the göttingen gymnasium residing at the home of one of the professors he obtained the leaving certificate the abitur six years later he had become passionate about the study of chemistry matriculating at the university of göttingen in the spring of in order to study with the famous chemist friedrich wöhler in he became an assistant to robert bunsen at the philipps universität marburg he took his doctoral degree in at the same university new opportunity arose in when he became assistant to lyon playfair at the new museum of economic geology in london and close friend of edward frankland from he was engaged in editing the handwörterbuch der reinen und angewandten chemie dictionary of pure and applied chemistry edited by justus von liebig wöhler and johann christian poggendorff and he also wrote an important textbook in kolbe succeeded bunsen as professor of chemistry at marburg and in he was called to the universität leipzig in he was elected foreign member of the royal swedish academy of sciences in he married charlotte the daughter of general major wilhelm von bardeleben his wife died in after years of happy marriage they had four children work in chemical research as late as the and despite friedrich wöhler synthesis of urea in some chemists still believed in the doctrine of vitalism according to which special life force was necessary to create organic in its original meaning biologically derived compounds kolbe promoted the idea that organic compounds could be derived from substances clearly sourced from outside this organic context directly or indirectly by substitution processes hence while by modern definitions he was converting one organic molecule to another by the parlance of his era he was converting inorganic anorganisch substances into organic ones only thought accessible through vital processes he validated his theory by converting carbon disulfide to acetic acid in several steps kolbe also introduced modified idea of structural radicals so contributing to the development of structural theory dramatic success came when his theoretical prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols was confirmed by the synthesis of the first of these classes of organic molecules kolbe was the first person to use the word synthesis in its present day meaning and contributed number of new chemical reactions in particular kolbe developed procedures for the electrolysis of the salts of fatty and other carboxylic acids kolbe electrolysis and prepared salicylic acid building block of aspirin in process called kolbe synthesis or kolbe schmitt reaction his method for the synthesis of nitriles is called the kolbe nitrile synthesis and with edward frankland he found that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding acids in addition to his own bench research and scholarly and editorial work kolbe oversaw student research at leipzig and especially at marburg students spending time under his tutelage included peter griess aleksandr mikhailovich zaitsev known for zaitsev rule predicting the product composition of elimination reactions theodor curtius discoverer of diazo compounds hydrazines and the curtius rearrangement ernst otto beckmann discoverer of the beckmann rearrangement carl graebe discoverer of alizarin oscar loew constantin fahlberg nikolai menshutkin vladimir markovnikov first to describe carbocycles smaller and larger than cyclohexane and known for markovnikov rule describing addition reactions to alkenes jacob volhard ludwig mond alexander crum brown first to describe the double bond of ethylene maxwell simpson and frederick guthrie work as journal editor besides his work for periodicals he wrote numerous books kolbe served for more than decade as what in modern terms would be understood the senior editor of the journal für praktische chemie journal of practical chemistry from to kolbe was sometimes so severely critical of the work of others especially after about that some wondered whether he might have been suffering mental illness he was intolerant of what he regarded as loose speculation parading as theory and sought through his writings to save his beloved science of chemistry from what he regarded as the scourge of modern structural theory his rejection of structural chemistry especially the theories of the structure of benzene by august kekulé the theory of the asymmetric carbon atom by van hoff and the reform of chemical nomenclature by adolf von baeyer was expressed in his vituperative articles in the journal für praktische chemie some translated quotes illustrate his manner of articulating the deep conflict between his interpretation of chemistry and that of the
