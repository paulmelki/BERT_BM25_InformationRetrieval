the structure of an alpha amino acid in its un ionized form amino acids are organic compounds that contain amine nh and carboxyl cooh functional groups along with side chain group specific to each amino acid the key elements of an amino acid are carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen although other elements are found in the side chains of certain amino acids about naturally occurring amino acids are known though only appear in the genetic code and can be classified in many ways they can be classified according to the core structural functional groups locations as alpha beta gamma or delta amino acids other categories relate to polarity ph level and side chain group type aliphatic acyclic aromatic containing hydroxyl or sulfur etc in the form of proteins amino acid residues form the second largest component water is the largest of human muscles and other tissues beyond their role as residues in proteins amino acids participate in number of processes such as transport and biosynthesis in biochemistry amino acids which have the amine group attached to the alpha carbon atom next to the carboxyl group have particular importance they are known as alpha or amino acids generic formula nchrcooh in most cases where is an organic substituent known as side chain often the term amino acid is used to refer specifically to these they include the proteinogenic protein building amino acids which combine into peptide chains polypeptides to form the building blocks of vast array of proteins these are all stereoisomers left handed isomers although few amino acids right handed occur in bacterial envelopes as neuromodulator serine and in some antibiotics twenty of the proteinogenic amino acids are encoded directly by triplet codons in the genetic code and are known as standard amino acids the other two nonstandard or non canonical are selenocysteine present in many prokaryotes as well as most eukaryotes but not coded directly by dna and pyrrolysine found only in some archaea and one bacterium pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons for example selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon and secis element which is often the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria mitochondria and chloroplasts is generally considered as form of methionine rather than as separate proteinogenic amino acid codon trna combinations not found in nature can also be used to expand the genetic code and form novel proteins known as alloproteins incorporating non proteinogenic amino acids many important proteinogenic and non proteinogenic amino acids have biological functions for example in the human brain glutamate standard glutamic acid and gamma aminobutyric acid gaba nonstandard gamma amino acid are respectively the main excitatory and inhibitory hydroxyproline major component of the connective tissue collagen is synthesised from proline glycine is biosynthetic precursor to porphyrins used in red blood cells carnitine is used in lipid transport nine proteinogenic amino acids are called essential for humans because they cannot be produced from other compounds by the human body and so must be taken in as food others may be conditionally essential for certain ages or medical conditions essential amino acids may also differ between species because of their biological significance amino acids are important in nutrition and are commonly used in nutritional supplements fertilizers feed and food technology industrial uses include the production of drugs biodegradable plastics and chiral catalysts history the first few amino acids were discovered in the early th century in french chemists louis nicolas vauquelin and pierre jean robiquet isolated compound in asparagus that was subsequently named asparagine the first amino acid to be discovered cystine was discovered in although its monomer cysteine remained undiscovered until glycine and leucine were discovered in the last of the common amino acids to be discovered was threonine in by william cumming rose who also determined the essential amino acids and established the minimum daily requirements of all amino acids for optimal growth the unity of the chemical category was recognized by wurtz in but he gave no particular name to it the first use of the term amino acid in the english language dates from while the german term aminos√§ure was used earlier proteins were found to yield amino acids after enzymatic digestion or acid hydrolysis in emil fischer and franz hofmeister independently proposed that proteins are formed from many amino acids whereby bonds are formed between the amino group of one amino acid with the carboxyl group of another resulting in linear structure that fischer termed peptide general structure proteinogenic amino acids found in eukaryotes grouped according to their side chains pka values and charges carried at physiological ph in the structure shown at the top of the page represents side chain specific to each amino acid the carbon atom next to the carboxyl group is called the carbon amino acids containing an amino group bonded directly to the alpha carbon are referred to as alpha amino acids these include amino acids such as proline which contain secondary amines which used to be often referred to as imino acids isomerism alpha amino acids are the common natural forms of amino acids with the exception of glycine other natural amino acids adopt tthe configuration while amino acids represent all of the amino acids found in proteins during translation in the ribosome the and convention for amino acid configuration refers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself but rather to the optical activity of the isomer of glyceraldehyde from which that amino acid can in theory be synthesized glyceraldehyde is dextrorotatory glyceraldehyde is levorotatory in alternative fashion the and designators are used to indicate the absolute configuration almost all of the amino acids in proteins are at the carbon with cysteine being and glycine non chiral cysteine has its side chain in the same geometric location as the other amino acids but the terminology is reversed because sulfur has higher atomic number compared to the carboxyl oxygen which gives the side chain higher priority by the cahn ingold prelog sequence rules whereas the atoms in
